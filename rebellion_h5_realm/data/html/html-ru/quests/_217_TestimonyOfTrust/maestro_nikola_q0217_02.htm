I want to find out the principle by which the Corecontrols the life forms.<br1>
With your help, I might have a chance.<br1>
Amongthe range of life forms in Cruma Tower is *Porta*, which seems to be akind of Golem.<br1>
We Dwarves may not know much about Elven magic orspirits, but believe me when I tell you that we're the experts when itcomes to "created beings" like Golems.<br1>
If I can make a close analysis ofthe internal structure of Porta, I think I can divine its workings.<br1>
Inorder to do this, however, I will need a Heartstone sample.<br1>
Will you dome this favor? Go into the Tower and bring me *1 Heartstone of Porta*.<br1>
