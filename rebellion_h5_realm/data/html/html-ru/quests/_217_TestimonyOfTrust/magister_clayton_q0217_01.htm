I don't understand why the Tetrarch ask an outsiderlike you to do this such a job.<br1>
But I have never doubted TetrarchThifiell's wisdom and have carried out the rules with loyalty.<br1>
Therefore, even though I don't really feel like it, I will help you.<br1>
Iwill tell you the materials you must get from now on.<br1>
First, go to theCorridor of Death and gather the blood of *the guardian basilisk*.<br1>
10bottles of blood is just enough for a *basilisk plasma*.<br1>
Also, from theWasteland, gather 10 aphids which you will be able to obtain by killingthe *soldier ants* If you do so, you'll be able to get the *honeydew*.<br1>
Last, from the Cruma marshland of Dion, catch *the swamp stakato*andgather 10 bottles of their body fluids.<br1>
By doing so,*a stakato ichor*will be made.<br1>
When these 3 things are ready bring them back to me.<br1>
