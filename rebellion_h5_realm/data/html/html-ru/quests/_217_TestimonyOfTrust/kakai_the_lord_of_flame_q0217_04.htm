My prediction has proven false, young Human.<br1>
Takethis charm and leave.<br1>
This is a totem exchanged by Orc tribes tostrengthen alliances and relationships! This is merely a symbolicgesture, a chance for you to prove your trustworthiness.<br1>

The only things theybelieve in glitter and sparkle.<br1>
The trust that *Lockirin, head of theDwarves* speaks of may not be what you think.<br1>
