<font color="36DC25">ï»¿High Summoner Galatea:</font><br>
In the thousands of years since the world wasyoung, when Elves and the the elementals of the woods made theiragreement and declared their allegiance, summoning magic has evolvedinto a high level art.<br1>
Along with elemental spells that command fire andwind, summoning magic is one of the 3 traditional magical arts of theIvory Tower.<br1>
Summoning magic is not an easy path.<br1>
High level magic isrequired to communicate with creatures of the netherworld, enter into acontract with them, and bring them to your side.<br1>
A very strong will isrequired to make the summoned creature obey your command.<br1>
Many magicianshave lost their lives for lack of a strong will when summoning.<br1>
Therefore, high level summoning spells must only be taught to thosewhose skills have been acknowledged.<br1>
If you wish to follow the path ofthe Summoner, you must challenge and pass the *Test of the Summoner*,which tests your abilities as a Summoner.<br1>
In my opinion, you are not yetready to attempt the trial.<br1>
Continue your training, then come and see meagain.<br1>
