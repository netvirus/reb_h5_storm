The Arcana Card is engraved with the Summoner'sname and unique mark.<br1>
Most Summoners are highly competitive and wish toshow off the mementos of their victories.<br1>
Thus, the tradition of 'ArcanaCards' began.<br1>
As an apprentice, you may begin battle only after a higherlevel Summoner has given you a card.<br1>
*If you do not have an apprenticeArcana Card, the opponent will not accept your challenge.<br1>
* You must giveyour opponent an Arcana Card each time you are defeated, so I suggestthat you have a good supply of cards created.<br1>
If you are victorious youwill receive your opponent's card.<br1>
It is easy to see who a Summoner hasdefeated by looking at his or her Arcana Cards.<br1>
In the past, Summonerscreated their own cards, but now the cards are much more sophisticatedand must be created by Craftsmen.<br1>
