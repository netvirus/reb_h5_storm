Our task is to discover the hidden facts, and revealthe truth.<br1>
The Dark Elves have the shortest history and are the fewestin number among the 5 races, but we understand the power of darknessbetter than anybody else.<br1>
We explore and manage without fear the verything that other tribes fears, the power of darkness, the ultimatesecrets veiled under the abyss of darkness.<br1>
This is our strength.<br1>

This is what we firmly believe.<br1>
