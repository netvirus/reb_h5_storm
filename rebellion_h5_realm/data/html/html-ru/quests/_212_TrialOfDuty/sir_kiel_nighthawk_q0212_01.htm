<font color="36DC25">ï»¿Sir Kiel Nighthawk:</font><br>
Greetings, young Warrior.<br1>
I am Kiel Nighthawk ofthe Griffon Knight union.<br1>
Hannavalt sent word that you were coming.<br1>
Oneof the virtues that define a Knight's character is a *sense of justice*.<br1>
The history of this land of Dion is rife with gross injustice.<br1>
One ofthe most heinous was the case of Sir Talianus.<br1>
He was commissioned bythe King to write a report about the causes and effects of the peasant'suprising.<br1>
He was captured by rebels and accused of being a spy.<br1>
Hesuffered days of unspeakable torture before death mercifully came.<br1>
Hisreport was torn up and scattered to the wind.<br1>
His troops tried tocollect the pieces of the report and they suffered the same fate astheir leader.<br1>
Until this day people claim that they hear the agonizedwails of Sir Talianus and his troops, wafting across the executiongrounds.<br1>
I fear that their spirits are wandering the earth, unable tojoin with Shilen.<br1>
Would you please seek justice for Sir Talianus? Killthe *strains* and the *ghouls* to collect the *torn pieces of thereport*.<br1>
When you gather all the pieces and complete *Talianus' Report*bring it back to me.<br1>
