There is power dwelling in this mirrorwhich enables you to see the spirits of the dead.<br1>
You must find andconfront the doomed *hangman tree*.<br1>
Free the spirits of Sir Talianus andhis troops from their prison.<br1>
Tell the spirit of Sir Talianus that thereport for which he and his men gave their lives will be delivered tothe King.<br1>
This should give them peace at last.<br1>
