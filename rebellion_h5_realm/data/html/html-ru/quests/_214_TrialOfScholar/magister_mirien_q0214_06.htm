Good job.<br1>
I understand that High Priest Sylvain askedyou to bring back the Crystal of Purity? I am glad to see that myconcerns were unjustified.<br1>
Congratulations! Now you should see *GrandMagister Jurek*.<br1>
He can be found at the *Wizard Guild of Giran CastleTown*.<br1>
He once was Chief Wizard of the Ivory Tower, but grew weary ofthe factional infighting within the Ivory Tower and quit.<br1>
Now, take thismark and go see *Jurek* in Giran Castle Town.<br1>
I wish you a safe journey.<br1>
