A very good idea, I shall do my best.<br1>
Let's see,the arms were unusually long, and the head much larger than a human's.<br1>
And the tail.<br1>
It seemed as though the shadow was cast by one faraway.<br1>
.<br1>
<p>Oh yes, one more thing before you go.<br1>
.<br1>
Soon you shall meet an	ancient one.<br1>
This meeting will be a part of the test you are taking.<br1>
.<br1>
You will return to this place soon.<br1>
.<br1>
Until then.<br1>
Farewell.<br1>
