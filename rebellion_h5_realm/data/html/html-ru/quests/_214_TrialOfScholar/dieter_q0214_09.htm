The loss of the scriptures diminished my reasoning fora time.<br1>
There were many outsiders around in those days.<br1>
Mostlyill-trained hunters, watching for a chance for one shot at the village.<br1>
They were laughable.<br1>
However there were some outsiders who did not huntand were always gone in the evenings.<br1>
Yes! I remember them! There were4 in the party, 2 humans, a Dwarf and a Dark Elf! I remember speakingwith the Dark Elf once.<br1>
He asked me something about my master, I can'treally remember.<br1>
The inn where they stayed is gone and the innkeeperdied 2 years ago.<br1>
I was good friends with the innkeeper's son, hisname was *Edroc*.<br1>
The last I heard he was running a shop in *the HuntersVillage*.<br1>
He might have some useful information.<br1>
Go and see him, I willwrite a Letter of Introduction for you.<br1>
