Thank you for saying that.<br1>
Asamah and I suspect that myillness is somehow connected to our ancient home, the Lost Nest.<br1>
Nor dowe think that our troubles have ended simply because I have beenrestored to health.<br1>
But in you, I see the fated link that will reconnectmy people with our past and our future.<br1>
The moment my eyes beheld you,my spirit told me that you are the one destined to save the Elroki.<br1>
