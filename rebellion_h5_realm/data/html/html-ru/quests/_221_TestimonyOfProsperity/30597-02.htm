Hope.<br1>
, Yes, I suppose there is hope after all.<br1>
These daysthe hired troops are taking care of the Orcs while my brothers and Iwork day and night to reclaim the land.<br1>
Someday this farm will boast therichest land in the kingdom of Aden! So you seek the *Token of theFertile Lands*? Then you shall have it.<br1>
I was given this from anotherDwarf.<br1>
He appeared at a time when I had just come to this barren landand was having no luck growing crops.<br1>
He gave me a seed and said that*the blessings of Maphr were within it*.<br1>
When I planted this seed itenriched the soil and my harvests have been improving steadily sincethen.<br1>
I put back some of the seeds and have saved them until this day.<br1>
Now I shall share the seeds with you.<br1>
This gift from one Dwarf I nowgive to another.<br1>
