Do you remember all the materials needed for the bouquet?*20 mandragora flower petals* and *10 bunches of crimson moss*.<br1>
You mayacquire the petals from the *mandragoras* that grow on the west parts ofthe execution grounds, and the moss is found near the *crimson ants ofthe Cruma marshlands*.<br1>
Good luck, then.<br1>
I hope to make the bouquet soonand see my mother smile.<br1>
