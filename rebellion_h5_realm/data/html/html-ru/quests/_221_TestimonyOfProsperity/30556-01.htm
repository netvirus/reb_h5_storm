*Donation*? Donation? Let me see.<br1>
Is it already time foranother donation? Strange indeed! It seems like only a day has passedsince I gave one.<br1>
Isn't this a trick from that rascal Arin? He used tobe a simple blade bat-catcher when I was one of the Elders and now thathe became one, he dares to command me? Impudent rascal! But I can't justsay no to your earnestness to come here.<br1>
OK, I will excuse him this timefor you.<br1>
Take it.<br1>
Here is my donation.<br1>
Go and give it to that rascal.<br1>
