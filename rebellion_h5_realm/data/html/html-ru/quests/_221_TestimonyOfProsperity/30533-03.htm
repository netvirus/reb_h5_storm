Ah, Mion.<br1>
So rich, but always late with guildpayments.<br1>
This is not the first time this has happened.<br1>
He ignores hisobligations on purpose.<br1>
He must be taught a lesson! I see you havereceived Maryse Redbonnet's dues.<br1>
I thought he was so blinded by revengethat he couldn't see anything else.<br1>
At least he knows how to pay.<br1>
Manythanks for your troubles! Here is the *receipt*.<br1>
Take this to the FirstElder.<br1>
