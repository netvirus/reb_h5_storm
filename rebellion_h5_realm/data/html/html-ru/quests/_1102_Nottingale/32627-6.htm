<br> Dius the Messenger of Destruction is a huge Drake of the Sky.<br1>
He scours the skies for Tiat, the lord of the Seed of Destruction.<br1>
<br> Fortunately, he is normally scarce.<br1>
If you apply a special	<font color="LEVEL">bait for Drakes</font> to	<font color="LEVEL">Baby Drake Wings</font>, however, you can lure him	out.<br1>
I will mark the area where he appears on your map.<br1>
