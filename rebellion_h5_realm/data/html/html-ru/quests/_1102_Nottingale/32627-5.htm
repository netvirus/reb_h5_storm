<br> It is said that Enira the Banshee Queen is a subordinate of	Ekimus, the ruler of the Seed of Infinity.<br1>
But I believe differently.<br1>
It seems as though she is keeping an eye on the Seed of Infinity.<br1>
<br> Of course, I'm not saying Enira is on our side.<br1>
She is still	very much a threat.<br1>
If we hope to travel the skies of Gracia	unmolested, she must be defeated.<br1>
I have marked the areas where she	frequently appears on your map.<br1>
