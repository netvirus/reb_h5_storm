It's a freight box of our commercial guild!? Itis freight that was stolen from our carts having been attacked by evilcreatures recently.<br1>
But there is a lot of freight that was looted and soour losses are really big.<br1>
Still, it is really fortunate that you couldrecover this part.<br1>
As a representative of the commercial guild, I thankyou for your efforts.<br1>
Here, take this gift of gratitude, even thoughit's not much.<br1>
And I present you with these (*coins from our guild*).<br1>
It's like a plaque of appreciation that we give to people that havecontributed to the commercial guild.<br1>
