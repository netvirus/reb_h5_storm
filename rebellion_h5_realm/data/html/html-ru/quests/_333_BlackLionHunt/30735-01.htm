All right! The time has come for the black lions thathave been crouching until now, to bare their claws and start hunting!Now, I will explain our combat situation.<br1>
We currently have four targetsof attack.<br1>
They are the Execution Ground, the Partisan Hideaway,southern shoreline area, and the Cruma Marshlands.<br1>
Since we do not haveenough combat power to hold a drawn-out war, we will dispatch a smallgroup of soldiers as a strike force to carry out the strategy of hit andrun to drive out the evil spirits.<br1>
