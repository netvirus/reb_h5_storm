Throughout the continent this temple is theonly place where the goddess Shilen is enshrined.<br1>
Due to the humansdistorted religious reformation, our goddess that we worship has beenmisunderstood to be a sinister being that brings death and destruction.<br1>
But we dark elves still worship Shilen as our creator and as a goddesswho is in charge of life and death.<br1>
Unfortunately, when this place wasinvaded by the allied forces of humans and elves, many sacred objectswhich were decorating the temple were lost.<br1>
Especially, many statues ofthe goddess Shilen which were exquisitely crafted were stolen.<br1>
We theAbyssal Celebrants are willing to give a great reward to those who canrecover the statues for us.<br1>
