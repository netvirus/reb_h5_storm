All right, lets go ahead and open this box Openinga padlock like this one is a piece of cake Here we go! There that wastoo easy.<br1>
Now, lets see whats in the box.<br1>
Whats this? A fragment of astone statue? Hmm it looks like a Statue of Shilen, the goddess Isnt shethe goddess of death? For some reason, I dont have a good feeling aboutthis.<br1>
But, if this was not a fragment but the complete statue, itcould have fetched a large amount of money There is someone who can puttogether a broken relic like this Hes Blacksmith Rupio.<br1>
If you collectall the fragments of the statue and take them to him, he will put themtogether to restore it and make it complete.<br1>
