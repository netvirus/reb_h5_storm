That statue is a sacred object for us darkelves.<br1>
Anyway, if you keep it for yourself, you wont have much use forit.<br1>
Furthermore, if you carry a statue of Shilen with you and walkaround among humans, people will accuse you of being a pagan.<br1>
You wouldbe lucky if you are not burnt to death at the stake.<br1>
Anyway, if youchange your mind, please come back and see me.<br1>
If you hand over thestatue to me, I am willing to pay you a generous sum of reward money.<br1>
Well, then may the divine protection of abyss be with you.<br1>
