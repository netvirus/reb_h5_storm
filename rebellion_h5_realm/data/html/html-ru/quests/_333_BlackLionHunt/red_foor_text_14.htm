Some time ago, while I was talking with the membersof the Dark Elf Guild, I found out that Dark Elves worship the GoddessShilen!! Are you saying that everybody already knows about that? Well, Iheard about it for the first time Why would you want to worship agoddess of death It doesnt make any sense to me.<br1>
But according to thosewho have been to the Dark Forest, the Temple of Shilen built by the DarkElves is truly magnificent.<br1>
