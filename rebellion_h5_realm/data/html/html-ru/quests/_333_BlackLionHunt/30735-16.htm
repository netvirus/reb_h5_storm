What?! You want to leave the Black Lion troop? Well,I guess you must have your own reasons.<br1>
I wont ask about that However,Ill tell you one thing The only place for someone like yourself who wasborn with the blood of a fighter is in a mercenary troop.<br1>
No matterwhere you go, you are destined to end up on the battlefield.<br1>
Anyhow, ifyou really want to withdraw from the mercenary troop, bear this in mind.<br1>
Upon your departure, you will have to return the Black Lion Mark.<br1>
Also,according to your contributions of service you have achieved so far, youwill receive the proper discharge pay.<br1>
