If you really have already made up your mind, I willnot hold you back any more.<br1>
Please return the Black Lion Mark.<br1>
I regretthat our relationship as comrades will end from here on.<br1>
Oh, take thisbefore you go.<br1>
This is the reward for your services you have earneduntil now for the mercenary troop.<br1>
Wherever you go, you can use it asseed money to establish yourself in a new place.<br1>
Well, until the daywhen we draw our swords together again.<br1>
