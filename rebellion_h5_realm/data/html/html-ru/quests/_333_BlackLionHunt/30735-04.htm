The enemies that you will deal with are *DeluLizardmen, Delu Lizardman Scouts and Delu Lizardman Warriors*.<br1>
As aproof that you slayed them, bring back the *Delu Lizardmens' Teeth*.<br1>
Butbe careful.<br1>
Comparing with the felim tribe in Gludio or langk lizardman,they are much more violent and hostile.<br1>
