What's more dangerous than a Knight's sword or a Wizard's staff?<br1>
That thing we call love. More silently than a thief, swifter than a sunset it comes upon you and captures your soul.<br1>
The minstrels were right, it's sweet and bitter all at once!<br1>
I cannot concentrate, I cannot sleep, I cannot eat!<br>
