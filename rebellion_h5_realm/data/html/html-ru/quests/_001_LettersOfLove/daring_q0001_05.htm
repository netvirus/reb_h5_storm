Ah, then you can see why I am so tormented!<br1>
She is an amazing woman...in fact, why would a woman like that ever return the love I feel for her?<br1>
For months, I vowed every day to tell her how I feel, and every day my courage deserted me.<br1>
What would I do if she rejected me?<br1>
Now I've written her a *love letter,* but I can't bring myself to deliver it.<br1>
May I ask a favor?<br1>
Would you deliver my letter to Roxxy?<br>
