What's more dangerous than a Knight's sword or a Wizard's staff?<br1>
That thing we call love. More silently than a thief, swifter than a sunset it comes upon you and captures your soul.<br1>
The minstrels were right, it's sweet and bitter all at once! One moment my heart soars to the heights of joy, the next it plummets into the depths of despair.<br1>
Can you explain it? Ah, but I see you are focused on the world of adventure, not romance.<br1>
Just remember: one day you too may fall under love's irresistible spell...<br1>
