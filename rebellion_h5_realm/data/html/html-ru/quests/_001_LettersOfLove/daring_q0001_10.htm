You brought the potion?<br1>
Thank you! I've already bought roses and even finished the poem I was writing for Roxxy.<br1>
Now that I have Baulro's potion, all that's left is for me to do is to go and talk to her.<br1>
I know in my heart this is meant to be!<br1>
I couldn't have done any of this without your help.<br1>
Please accept this small gift as a token of my gratitude.<br1>
I'm afraid it's not much, but please know you have my undying thanks!
