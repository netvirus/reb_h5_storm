He has his loyal subordinates, their group is called*Wings of Sand*.<br1>
They are preparing the attack simultaneously so it'llbe hard to defeat them.<br1>
But there's a way.<br1>
Use Dragon Vortex to summonany of the seben of them: *Emerald Horn, Dust Rider, Bleeding Fly, BlackDagger Wing, Shadow Summoner, Spike Slasher, Muscle Bomber*.<br1>
