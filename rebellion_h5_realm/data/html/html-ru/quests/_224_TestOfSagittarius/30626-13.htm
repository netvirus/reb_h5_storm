Sagittarius Hamil So you haven't been able to meet Brankel.<br1>
He leftin search for the heathens? He is a great man indeed.<br1>
He was right.<br1>
Therebirth of *Commander Kadesh* must not be their final goal.<br1>
Everythingis apparent now with that amulet you brought.<br1>
The seven eyes.<br1>
This isthe very mark which identifies the children of Shilen.<br1>
I'd better reportthis to the hunter's union now.<br1>
I will return this crescent's arrow tothe Ivory Tower of Oren.<br1>
Thank you for your trouble.<br1>
You have done muchmore than Brankel or me in this incident.<br1>
Something terrible couldhave happened if it weren't for you.<br1>
You are already a Sagittarius.<br1>
Take this with you, this *Mark of Sagittarius*.<br1>
Maybe there will come aday when you and I shall hunt together.<br1>
