I am Magister Gauen.<br1>
Commander Kadesh, the CrescentArrow.<br1>
You have brought me some stories that I'll never miss.<br1>
Commander Kadesh is the darest one even among the sons of Shilen.<br1>
Hegulps in everything, yet is always hungry.<br1>
That is because he constantlygrows up.<br1>
This caused fear among the Gods, so they gave instructionsto the Elves on how to kill Commander Kadesh.<br1>
That is *the CrescentArrow*.<br1>
This arrow was kept in the Ivory Tower since long ago, butbecause of an incident that happened 20 years ago it became useless.<br1>
but if it is true what you are saying, I guess we do need thearrow.<br1>
I will restore the arrow.<br1>
But it is not an easy task for sure.<br1>
Most of the materials you'll be able to find in the Ivory Tower but someof the others you'll have to find it for yourself.<br1>
