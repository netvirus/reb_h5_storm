Sagittarius Hamil I didn't even imagine that they would mobilize othersavage tribes in their plan .<br1>
Those heathens seem to be more elaboratethan I had thought.<br1>
Let me see what Brankel told you.<br1>
.<br1>
too late.<br1>
TheOrc shamans have revived the serpent.<br1>
.<br1>
the Commander has beenawakened.<br1>
I shall track it.<br1>
The crescent will kill it.<br1>
The Ivory Towerof Gauen.<br1>
Commander? *Commander Kadesh*! I never thought I wouldhear his name again.<br1>
He is the devil who appears to be a serpent.<br1>
Onewho spread blood and virulence in this land of south Oren a long timeago.<br1>
They say that those devils who don't belong to this land can onlybe killed by a special weapon.<br1>
Among the special weapons, the one thatcan kill Kadesh is the*Crescent Arrow*.<br1>
The crescent that Brankelmentioned is the Crescent Arrow.<br1>
But that arrow.<br1>
Never mind, we'llthink about that later.<br1>
You should go to the *Ivory tower of Oren *andmeet *Magister Gauen*now.<br1>
As far as I know, he took over theresponsibility of managing the Crescent Arrow.<br1>
