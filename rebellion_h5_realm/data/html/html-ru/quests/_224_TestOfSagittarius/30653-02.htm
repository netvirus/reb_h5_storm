Sir Aaron Tanford About 10 days from now.<br1>
A couple of explorersentered the wasteland area claiming that they had come to excavate theantiquities of the empirical era.<br1>
I felt there was something suspiciousabout them, but didn't stop them.<br1>
A few days later, when Hunter Brankelcame to see me, I realized that I had made a mistake.<br1>
They were no mereexplorers but a bunch of heathens.<br1>
As you know, this wasteland area iswhere the castle of devil beleth used to lie in the past.<br1>
I am sure thatthe heathens came to find the evil remains of beleth.<br1>
Brankel went tothe *Ant's Nest of the Wastelands* saying that he had to find out whattheir real purpose is.<br1>
Ever since then I haven't heard from him.<br1>
I amsorry but this is all I know.<br1>
