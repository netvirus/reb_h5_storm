Nice to meet you young Warrior.<br1>
Did Bernard send youhere? We were just in need of some help.<br1>
I'm glad that you came.<br1>
Rightnow, in the southern part of the kingdom, something unusual is going on.<br1>
The wasteland ants are making some movement and from the east, the BrekaOrcs are.<br1>
Moreover, they say that something weird is happening up inthe Cruma Tower.<br1>
The Dwarves are all whispering about it.<br1>
That the'thing' has awoken from underneath the tower.<br1>
I think that this isonly a tip of the iceberg.<br1>
I believe there is more to come, somethingeven bigger.<br1>
Although that is the least thing I would hope for.<br1>
Ifonly we can find Brankel, we could have some more precise information.<br1>
