Ascalon.<br1>
It is a name that I have long forgotten.<br1>
After Iquit my job in the army, I got married to a beautiful woman calledLillian and we settled down in my hometown of Dion where we spent somehappy and peaceful days.<br1>
And then one day, Grecia's army attacked andthey killed my wife and children.<br1>
Since then alcohol has been my onlycompany.<br1>
I often find myself crying by the riverside in grief of havingto let my loved ones go.<br1>
Grecia's army is my lifelong enemy becausethey deprived me of my most precious thing, my family.<br1>
*I swear thatI'll revenge on them.<br1>
