Welcome, my friend.<br1>
If Master Luther sent you here you must beready to get to work.<br1>
Floran Village needs more good workers like you.<br1>
We don't have a guard or even a single skilled person! I have beenwaiting for you since I received the warrant of appointment.<br1>
Take thisand give it to my adjutant *Militia Leirynn*.<br1>
She is a modest lady.<br1>
Iam afraid that work here may not be as easy as you think.<br1>
I thank youin advance.<br1>
