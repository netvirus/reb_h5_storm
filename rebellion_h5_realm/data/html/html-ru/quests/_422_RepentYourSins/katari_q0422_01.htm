At last! You have come for me! Oh, pardon me.<br1>
I had a veryvivid dream last night, and I've been waiting for someone like you tocome for me.<br1>
Just in case you were the one in my dreams, I wanted you toknow.<br1>
Well.<br1>
then, I may as well ask you.<br1>
I and some religious olmahums are being threatened by *scavenger wererats*.<br1>
They seem to beunaware of the teachings of the god of light.<br1>
Everyone knows, even aftera conversion, ol mahums are not to be trifled with.<br1>
The same can be saidof the Dark Elves.<br1>
Our god of light is no coward, and I'm ready to teachthem a thing or two.<br1>
Please, would you go kill these creatures? Bringback 10 *skulls of scavenger wererats*.<br1>
They can be found in the*Neutral Zone*.<br1>
Put a good scare into them, something to let them knowthey shouldn't pick on missionaries.<br1>
