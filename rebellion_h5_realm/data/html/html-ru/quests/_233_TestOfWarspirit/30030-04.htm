According to the records, the graves of Kelhas andKiruna are in the south of Gludio, a place which has now turned into aWasteland area.<br1>
But that was already a thousand years ago.<br1>
I am notsure if their remains will still be there.<br1>
Perhaps Salient who knowsthe area well, might know of its whereabouts! I shall write you aletter.<br1>
You'd better go and meet him.<br1>
He is doing commerce near thesouthern entrance of the Wasteland.<br1>
