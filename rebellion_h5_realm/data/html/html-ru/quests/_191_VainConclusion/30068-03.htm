<br> Hmm.<br1>
Unfortunately, the Cruma are extinct.<br1>
<br> You know of the ancient war between Elves and Humans? At that	time, the Cruma became our greatest ally.<br1>
But we were overwhelmed by	the Humans' sheer numbers and forced to retreat.<br1>
The Cruma fought a	valiant rearguard action, giving us time to reach a safe haven.<br1>
It was	mortally wounded, however, and fell in the place now known as the Sea	of Spores.<br1>
That was the last of its noble kind.<br1>
