<br> You made it back safely, thanks be to Maphr! The magical	shield in the Mithril Mine seems to have been stabilized.<br1>
at least	for now.<br1>
<br> Thank you for your help! Here is the reward I promised -- use	it well.<br1>
I fear this positive change is only temporary, though, so I	hope you will help us if the shield begins to weaken again.<br1>
