Welcome, comrade of Ketra! Wahkan has told me of youractivities.<br1>
I'm sure that you're the right person for this mission! WeKetra Orcs are unrivaled warriors.<br1>
The Silenos cannot defeat us, butthey've been a nuisance to our noble corps for far too long! I'mconvinced that they're receiving help from some unknown power! Breakinto the Varka Silenos barracks and take the totem of Soul Guide UdanMardui! This totem must be the source of their hidden power.<br1>
You can'trisk capture, so avoid confronting them directly.<br1>
Once you do this, I'llgive you the *Divine Stone of Wisdom*, a sacred relic of our tribe! Thetotem is locked inside a box, so don't forget to take the *Key of Thief*with you.<br1>
