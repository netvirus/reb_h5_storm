<br> One day, a Dwarf came to see me.<br1>
I could not see his face	because he was wearing a scarf but.<br1>
he promised to give me a good sum	of Adena if I found something hidden in this mine.<br1>
<br> But he fooled us! We just did what he told us to do, but then	evil spirits spread out to every corner of the mine.<br1>
Gak! Now my	followers have been driven mad.<br1>
<br> Would you help me save my followers?	<br>	<a action="bypass -h Quest _450_GraveRobberMemberRescue 32650-03.<br1>
