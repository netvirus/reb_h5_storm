The Guardian Golem was a huge and powerful being.<br1>
OurWarsmiths fought valiantly against it, but we were finally forced toretreat.<br1>
By the time we regrouped and returned, all the working golemswere already under Dr.<br1>
Chaos' control.<br1>
We again had to retreat.<br1>
I haveremained here ever since in order to find a band of adventurers such asyourselves, hoping to find out exactly how Dr.<br1>
Chaos accomplished allthis  and, more importantly, what we can do to stop him.<br1>
We havelearned much from Wendy and Atlanta, but perhaps not yet all.<br1>
Go andseek out Wendy once more.<br1>
Find out all you can about Dr.<br1>
Chaos' past andpresent actions  and put a stop to his evil once and for all.<br1>
