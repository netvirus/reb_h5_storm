The east wing? Oh, yes.<br1>
You are probably are talking about theplace where I was born.<br1>
Dr.<br1>
Chaos had his offices in the east wing.<br1>
Thelast guardian was also resurrected there.<br1>
My memory of that time is notclear, but Dr.<br1>
Chaos' records are still on the bookshelf next to hislab.<br1>
The record in question is a book with a lock on it.<br1>
I cannot openit, but the Dwarves in the north may know how.<br1>
*Please be careful.<br1>
Theremight be a trap on the shelf.<br1>
