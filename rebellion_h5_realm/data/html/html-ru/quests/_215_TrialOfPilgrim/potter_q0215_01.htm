So you came to such a remote island to find the truereligion of Einhasad.<br1>
I came here many years ago after I incurred thehatred of the High Priests.<br1>
Apparently I was trying to clarify the truthtoo specifically.<br1>
Anyway, I much prefer the liberal atmosphere here overthe corrupt inner circle.<br1>
.<br1>
I have so much to tell you.<br1>
But first Ihave a favor I must ask.<br1>
Please get rid of the *malignant spiritNahir* coiling in the *Elven Ruins*.<br1>
This will enhance your learning.<br1>
