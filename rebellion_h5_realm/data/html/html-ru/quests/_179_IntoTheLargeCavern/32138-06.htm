I am glad to hear you say so.<br1>
N is in the furthestrecesses of the Nornil's Garden, within the large cave.<br1>
As I told youbefore, now that you have been acknowledged by N, you may enter theNornil's Garden and take your comrades, whether or not they have beenpersonally acknowledged.<br1>
It would be safest for you to go with a groupif possible.<br1>
Once you have penetrated to the deepest corner of theNornil's Garden, you must defeat the one you find there and obtain a keythat opens the entrance to the cave.<br1>
There you will find 3 doorsblocking your way.<br1>
If you open all 3 doors, you will be able to meet N.<br1>
You will need a password to open the Door of the Past, the Door of thePresent and the Door of the Future.<br1>
But do not be anxious! It is thesame password as the one you used to communicate before.<br1>
