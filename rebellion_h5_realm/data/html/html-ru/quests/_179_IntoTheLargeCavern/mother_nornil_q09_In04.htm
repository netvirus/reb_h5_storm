<br>This Isle of Souls was sealed long ago to keep it hidden and	protected.<br1>
But if the Kamael were to truly grow strong as a race, they	must be prepared for the day when the seal was released and all the	dangers of the world lay before them.<br1>
<br>So an external device was created artificially to provide both	crisis and blessing to this Isle of Souls.<br1>
I, Mother Nornil, am the	central processing unit that controls the island's entire ecosystem.<br1>
I	also produce the monsters that roam this island.<br1>
