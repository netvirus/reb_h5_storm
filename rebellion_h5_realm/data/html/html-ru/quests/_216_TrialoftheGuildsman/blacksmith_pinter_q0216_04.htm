You think you can get the Amber Beads byyourself? Oho! Indeed you are a Raider! I can tell you where to look.<br1>
There are giant ants living in the *Wastelands*, in the southern part ofGludio.<br1>
They mine the Amber Beads, which are plentiful there.<br1>
To get thebeads you must kill the *work ants* not the ant soldiers, understand?You will be able to collect faster by casting *Spoil*.<br1>
We will needabout 20 beads to make Journeyman Deco Beads.<br1>
However I can also usethem in my work, I would be very grateful if you brought back *70*.<br1>
Iwill give your order top priority.<br1>
