They were obviously jealous of the fact that that I, theFirst Orc, was much stronger than their puny creations.<br1>
When Paagrioordered me here, they schemed to use the abundant water of this earth toextinguish my inner fire, to harden the lava that flows in my veins.<br1>
With my last dying breath I gave birth to the fathers of the 7 tribes,in whom I imbued my powers of honor and flame.<br1>
They also received mysecrets of strength through endless training.<br1>
This same character iswithin you.<br1>
Never ignore the spiritual flame that burns within.<br1>
