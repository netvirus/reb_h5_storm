Did you come to see me, Seer Manakia, under the commandof Atuba Chief Varkees? I can tell from your necklace that you aretaking the Test of the Lord! Then I shall tell you what to do now! Asyou know in this land there are plenty of traitor Orcs, those who haveforgotten their origin and pride as an Orc! You must punish themseverely by extracting their fangs and bringing them back to me! Ourtotem, the upright fang is made by collecting the fangs of the armieswe've conquered! Your task is to rid the land of the Breka Orcs, andbring their fangs as proof of your victory! But don't forget, asoldier's tooth is no good! Bring only the ones of the Shaman or theSeer! Return when you have collected twenty of them!<br1>
