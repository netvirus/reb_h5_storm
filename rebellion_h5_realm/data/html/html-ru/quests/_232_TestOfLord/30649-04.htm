Becoming a Lord of Orcs requires a suitable test.<br1>
Your test is to calm the soul of the first Orc, who died unfairly bykilling the betrayer of the seven tribes! You should know, there wereactually seven preceding tribes before our own.<br1>
However, after theoriginal seven went into eternal sleep, one tribe betrayed our race andall became chaos.<br1>
Because of the betrayal, we have forgotten theteachings of the first Orc and wasted thousands of years fighting eachother.<br1>
The tribe who betrayed the seven tribes is the Ragna! You mustfind Ragna Orcs and punish them! That is the only way to appease thefurious spirit of the first Orc.<br1>
