You called me a gift of the gods, a blessing to thewarrior's hand.<br1>
You charged me to carry out the sacred task at yourside.<br1>
Aieee! My shattered and scattered body.<br1>
Now the entire Lost Nestis my grave.<br1>
My master! I still hear the song you sang to me as we rodeinto battle.<br1>
Why am I imprisoned in this darkness? My lost master.<br1>
