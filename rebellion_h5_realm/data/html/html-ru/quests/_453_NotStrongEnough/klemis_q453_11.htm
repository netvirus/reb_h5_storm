The Cokrakon clans resemble birds, but believe me, theyaren't hunting worms.<br1>
These monsters can emit sound shockwaves that canshatter your bones, paralyze all your nerves and muscle tissue, andleave you basically unable to move quickly.<br1>
If Kookaburras give younightmares, these things will leave you unable to ever sleep again.<br1>
Doyourself a favor, when you go on the hunt, bring others with you.<br1>
If youcan kill<font color="LEVEL">20</font>each of the<font color="LEVEL">Kanibi, Kiriona, and Kaiona</font>variants, the region will be clear.<br1>
You should get started.<br1>
I wish youwell.<br1>
