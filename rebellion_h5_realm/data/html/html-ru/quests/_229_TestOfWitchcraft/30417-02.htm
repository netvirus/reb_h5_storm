I am taking care of three swords right now.<br1>
The firstone is the 'Sword of Ritual' which is used in every knighting ceremony,the second is the 'Sword of Chastity' which one of our family ancestorsreceived from the forest lady Ordana.<br1>
And the last one is the *Sword ofBinding* which Artreus, the hero of Elmoraden used to seal the magiccreatures of Shilen.<br1>
