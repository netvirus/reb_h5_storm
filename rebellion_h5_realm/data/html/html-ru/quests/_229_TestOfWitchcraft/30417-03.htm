I can see that you are in desperate need of the Swordof Binding even without an explanation.<br1>
But unfortunately, I can't lendyou the Sword of Binding without the *permission of the Einhasadshrine*.<br1>
It is just to make sure that the sword doesn't get in the handsof the betrayers from Shilen.<br1>
According to the legend, this sword hasthe power to seal the Black magic creatures, but it can also be the keyto freeing them.<br1>
Go and meet *Priest Vadin in Town of Oren*.<br1>
If you havehis permission that you can use the Sword of Binding, I shall gladlylend it to you.<br1>
