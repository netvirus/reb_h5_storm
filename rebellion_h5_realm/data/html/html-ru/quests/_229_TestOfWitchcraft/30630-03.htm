The power of darkness itself is neither good norbad.<br1>
Just as nobody judges a sharp blade if it is good or bad.<br1>
Themagic depends wholly on the user.<br1>
It may be used for justice as much asit may be used for slaughter and destruction.<br1>
The Wizards of the IvoryTower and the Priests of Einhasad threaten us by saying that thestudying or using of any Black magic is extremely dangerous.<br1>
It's justanother branch of magic, but they blame it as a filthy and immoralaction.<br1>
Those who never understand the truth that exists on the otherside as well, are detesting.<br1>
I don't know where you have been taughtlike that but if you have such kind of prejudice, you'd better give itup.<br1>
But, if you are ready to learn Black magic despite the bullying andscorn of people around you, I will gladly accept you as company.<br1>
