Th, thank you.<br1>
If General Ermian is still alive, I'dbet he's set up camp somewhere safe.<br1>
But it would be best if it doesn'ttake too long.<br1>
As you can see, I've been wounded and it won't be longuntil I either bleed out or disease takes it toll.<br1>
If you're prepared,let's depart.<br1>
