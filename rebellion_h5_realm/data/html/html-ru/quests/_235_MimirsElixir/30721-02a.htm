Great! I am glad to see you are full of ambition! In orderto start, you will need to create a magic potion which is known as"Mimir's Elixir".<br1>
In order to create this, you will first have to learnhow to mix reagents in the cauldron.<br1>
Then, you will need to find someingredients.<br1>
The first ingrendient is *Pure Silver*.<br1>
To create it, youwill need equal parts of lunargent and quicksilver.<br1>
Also, you will needto set a temperature for the fire.<br1>
Make sure you choose the lowest fire.<br1>
That is, set the temperature to 1.<br1>
Go and talk to *Magic Trader Wesley*.<br1>
He will teach you what you need to know to create pure silver.<br1>
Come backto me after you have aquired one.<br1>
