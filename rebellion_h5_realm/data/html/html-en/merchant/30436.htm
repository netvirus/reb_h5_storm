I studied at the Einhovant School of Magic when I wasjust a young sprout.<br1>
Eventually I discovered that my talent didn't liethat way and dropped out, but I think the time I spent there did me aworld of good.<br1>
All that book learning has really been useful in mysecond career as a trader.<br1>
