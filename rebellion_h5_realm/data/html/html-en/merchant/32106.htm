I don't know if you know this, but this wharf was once soridiculously shabby it couldn't even be properly called a wharf!Compared to then, it's a heck of a lot better now.<br1>
I still get a chilldown my back thinking about those days.<br1>
From time to time, thosehorrifying dinosaurs would even charge down from the jungle to devourthe settlers.<br1>
Now you see me as an old wharf manager, but back then Iwas just a hot-blooded young adventurer like you spoiling for a fight!Some days I was ready to tear into them with my bare hands.<br1>
Of course,then I saw what they could do to the unskilled.<br1>
Ah, but I still missthe days of my youth.<br1>
