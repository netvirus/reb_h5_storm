This wharf is visited by many ships and boatsboth near and far from other ports of the continent including the wharfin Talking Island.<br1>
Without this wharf, even the gigantic market in Giranwould not be able to function in normal capacity.<br1>
Currently, only thepassengers of regular liners, traders business people and a fewfishermen use this wharf and it seems that the wharf is not that busy.<br1>
But soon a village is going to be established near this wharf.<br1>
I heard arumor that dwarves are already funding the project.<br1>
Since the foundationfor a village has already been laid out, the only thing left is an orderfrom the lord.<br1>
