What, you haven't heard? Is this your first visit toInnadril? The Sword is the symbol of the Lord of Innadril.<br1>
It is filledwith history.<br1>
Several decades ago, the water dragon Fafurion rose up andcaused great devastation in these parts.<br1>
Then Lionel, the hunter, he wasjust a young lad at that time.<br1>
well, he faced the dragon -- withoutarmor, mind you -- and somehow put the dragon to sleep.<br1>
The Goddess Evawas so thankful that she gave him a magic sword.<br1>
In the years thatfollowed, it became the symbol for the Lord of Innadril.<br1>
That is the*Sword of Othelotte*.<br1>
But recently the sword has disappeared.<br1>
No one,not even the lord himself, knows its whereabouts.<br1>
And now Giran isscuttling its trade agreements with us, claiming that without the swordthere is no rightful lord in Innadril and the treaties areinvalidated.<br1>
