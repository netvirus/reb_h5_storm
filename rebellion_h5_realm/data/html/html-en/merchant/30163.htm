Welcome! Welcome to the Ivory Tower! This place is widelyregarded as some sort of hideout for Wizards, but there are manynon-Wizards who also come and go as they please.<br1>
Originally, in fact, Iwas a Paladin sworn to the service of Einhasad.<br1>
Don't mistake me -- Ihaven't betrayed my oath! Just so you know, odd things do often happenat this Tower -- don't go snooping where you don't belong, no matter howcurious you become.<br1>
It could be dangerous.<br1>
