Welcome! I deal in old books and spellbooks.<br1>
Books are a reservoir of civilization, don't you think? Without them,the world would revert into a primitive, savage place.<br1>
I don't even wantto imagine it! So many books were burned during the persecutions duringthe last years of the empire.<br1>
The idea of burning a book just becauseyou don't agree with what it says.<br1>
Oh, I get angry just thinking ofit! Of course, now it's possible to learn magic without spellbooks, so Iam not sure how much longer we will be needed.<br1>
If that happens, I guessI'll have to look for a librarian job at the Ivory Tower or Library ofRune.<br1>
