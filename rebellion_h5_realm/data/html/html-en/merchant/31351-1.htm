The Primeval Isle, you say.<br1>
I'm afraid that Idon't really know much about it.<br1>
I do know that it was discovered by aman named Marquez, and that very few people manage to reach it becauseof its remoteness and the limited means of transportation.<br1>
I have alsoheard that Rune is concocting plans to develop the Primeval Isle, whichis why it built a wharf there and even set up a ferry service.<br1>
But sincethe Primeval Isle isn't well known and it is said that there are manydangerous dinosaurs that roam its jungles, very few passengers choose toembark on the ferry.<br1>
Ah, but with so many curious adventurers heading tothese parts these days, I'm sure that ferry will soon have morepassengers than it can carry! If you're interested in taking the trip,the ferry for the Primeval Isle leaves about 3 or 4 times every hour;buy a ticket for it just like you would for any other ferry.<br1>
