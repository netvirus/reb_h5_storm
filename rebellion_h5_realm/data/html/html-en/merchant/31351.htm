Ah, lately the old memories seem to be floodingback.<br1>
Long ago, you know, this wharf was a beehive of activity! Tradeships of the Kresnik dropped anchor every day, filled to the gunwaleswith all sorts of wonderful items.<br1>
Giran to the south -- even Heine --were nothing by comparison.<br1>
But then the war came, and diplomaticrelations with the Kresnik were cut off.<br1>
No longer did the wealth-ladentrade ships visit.<br1>
Today, all we see are small passenger ships.<br1>
Oh, oncein a long while, a foreign vessel carrying a party of adventurers maystop in, but.<br1>
Sigh.<br1>
Oh, before I forget: I have heard news that aferry has begun service to Gludin Harbor, which is in the Gludio regionof Aden Kingdom.<br1>
The delays of the initial trial runs are over, and itis now in full operation.<br1>
