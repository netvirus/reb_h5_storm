Dragon Valley is an enormous canyon ruled by the dragons anddrakes.<br1>
The souls of those who resisted Antharas and fought against himturned into the undead there - they are bound there and left to awaittheir end.<br1>
The monsters become stronger as you get deeper into thevalley, so you MUST proceed with caution! There has been some severecrust movement lately in the Dragon Valley, so the dragons and theirhatchlings are frequently moving their nests.<br1>
