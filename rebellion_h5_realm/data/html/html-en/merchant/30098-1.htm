Ah, you have excellent taste! This bracelet is trulyunique.<br1>
In fact, it is said that it contains an *Agathion*.<br1>
Quite afind, eh? Wondering if it is for sale? Of course it is -- that's why I'mhere! Both this *Little Angel Agathion Bracelet* and this *Little DevilAgathion Bracelet* where discovered by another group of adventurerswhile exploring some acient ruins.<br1>
I am positive that they containAgathions! Of cource, no one knows for sure the power an Agathionpossesses or how long it lasts.<br1>
I have been reluctant to experiment onthem because it's clear that some of the bracelets possess only limitedmagic power.<br1>
Others have more, however.<br1>
What you get will depend on yourluck, I'm afraid.<br1>
If you wish to buy either the Little Angel Bracelet orthe Little Devil Bracelet, bring me *25 Big Red Nimble Fish, 50 GreatCodrans, 4 Memento Moris, 5 Earth Eggs, 5 Nonliving Nucleus, 3 DragonHearts*, and *7,500,000 Adena*.<br1>
Iwish I could part with them in exchangefor crystals as normally would, but the adventurers who deliveres thebracelets here insisted on these other items for payment.<br1>
Even so, Istill believe this is a reasonable price.<br1>
