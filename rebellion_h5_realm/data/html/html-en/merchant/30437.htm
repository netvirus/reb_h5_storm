<font color="36DC25">Trader Rolento:</font><br>
I am trader Rolento of the Silver Scales Guild! I havebeen dispatched by my guild to open a shop here.<br1>
As the link betweenGiran and Gludin, this location is perfect for commerce.<br1>
Of course,there was fierce competition in the guild over who should be sent here,but I'm the one who finally got this plum assignment! So.<br1>
