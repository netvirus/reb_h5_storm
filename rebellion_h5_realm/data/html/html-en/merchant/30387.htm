Welcome.<br1>
Do you want to get aboard? Now we havequite a number of routes here at Gludin.<br1>
We even had a test operation onthe route to the Elmore kingdom, with whom we once were at odds.<br1>
Now wehave regular liners and shuttles as there has been a growing number ofusers to the pleasure of me.<br1>
Would you try a regular liner ship to theRune Township of Elmore? It is on a regular schedule.<br1>
