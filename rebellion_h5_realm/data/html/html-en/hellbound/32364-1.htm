My brethren act rashly if given even the tiniest bitof freedom.<br1>
But unless they come to their senses, soon they will noteven have the freedom to draw breath! Some may say that the SteelCitadel will soon fall, but that is nonsense.<br1>
Any recent setbacks it hasexperienced are as fleeting as the morning dew.<br1>
.<br1>
If you stop toconsider how things stand, you cannot deny that there are also greatopportunities available for men not afraid to act in their bestinterests.<br1>
The Steel Citadel is not without its benefits, you know.<br1>
