I'm not asking anything particularly difficult, but do need afavor from you, my friend.<br1>
We in the Caravan travel to and through manyplaces on this island, which requires a great many of Darion's Badges.<br1>
Although we are able to lay out hands on some, they are simply notenough for us to turn a profit, even considering the natives'unquenching demand for Prayer Fragments.<br1>
If you can spare any Darion'sBadges, please give them to me.<br1>
I don't need that many — even 20 willsuffice.<br1>
In return, I will give you a voucher that will allow you tradewith the Caravan members.<br1>
