Shh! Please be still.<br1>
Over there is the *old town*, which is theonly entrance to the Steel Citadel.<br1>
It is used as a prison camp forNative captives.<br1>
Some time ago, when the Steel Citadel's defenses weretemporarily weakened, we attacked the town in an attempt to rescue thecaptives.<br1>
However, the enemy was still too strong, and many of us werekilled or wounded.<br1>
