-List of Ingredients and Mixing Formulas-**1.<br1>
Operating the Urn* Insert the Mixing Stone into the niche of theside of the urn.<br1>
*2.<br1>
Selecting Ingredients* Match the type and amountof ingredients to the reagent formula and place into the urn.<br1>
*3.<br1>
Selecting Catalyst Ingredients* Match the types and amount of catalystingredients to the reagent formula and place into the urn.<br1>
Use cautionbecause if there isn't enough catalyst the mixing will fail and all theingredients that have been placed into the urn will disappear.<br1>
*4.<br1>
Setting Temperature* There are three temperature settings: Temperature1 Salamander is by far the safest, and mixing will certainly succeed,but the least amount of reagent is produced.<br1>
With Temperature 2 Ifrit,there is a risk that the materials will be destroyed, but a largerquantity of reagent is produced.<br1>
Temperature 3 Phoenix is the highestand most likely to fail but creates the largest amount of reagent.<br1>
*5.<br1>
Mixing Ingredients* Once the correct types and quantities ofingredients and catalysts are placed into the urn and the temperature isset, the mixing begins.<br1>
If the formula is correct and the ingredientsdon't melt away, the desired reagent will be created.<br1>
