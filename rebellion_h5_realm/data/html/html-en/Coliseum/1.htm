Only parties whith more than 7 members can patricipateis the game and, if they win, keep playing.<br1>
You can also onlypatricipate in the arena reserved for your level When you enter thearena, you will see a Tower of Resurrection for each team.<br1>
Until youdestroy your opponents' tower, it will continue to resurresct them.<br1>
Takea look around the arena to understand how it will affect the battle.<br1>
This is about more than simple combat, you know.<br1>
Remember also thatany buff applied to the team will be negated if one of the members doesnot meet its level requirements.<br1>
Another bit of advice: considerstationing the team member who is best at solo matches on the frontline.<br1>
