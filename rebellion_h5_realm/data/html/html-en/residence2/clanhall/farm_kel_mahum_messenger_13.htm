Kookaburras are quite rare.<br1>
They possess unusually long legs andbrilliantly-colored feathers.<br1>
They peck the enemy with their beaks anduse a mysterious and extremely powerful magic.<br1>
They don't respond wellto beatings.<br1>
The only reason I was able to capture them is theirsusceptibility to magic.<br1>
