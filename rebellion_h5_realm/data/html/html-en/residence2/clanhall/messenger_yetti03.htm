Have you ever played a high stakes event? If so, you'llunderstand quickly.<br1>
Once you enter the arena, my good friend, the GameCoordinator, will provide instructions on how the game is played.<br1>
Hewill then call out some words, which you must spell by breaking thetreasure boxes in the four circles.<br1>
Combine the letters you find intowords, and take them to the Coordinator! You will then get an item foruse in the game! You can use this item against the Coordinator,depending on the situation.<br1>
You may hit a jackpot or impede others, orsometimes my jerk friend.<br1>
ehh.<br1>
Well, you'll find out soon enough.<br1>
<br>Oh, I almost forgot the most important thing! The only way to open theTreasure Boxes is by hitting them with your *bare hands*.<br1>
