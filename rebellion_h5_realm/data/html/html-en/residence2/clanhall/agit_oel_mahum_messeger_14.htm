Let me tell you what my opinion is regarding the Ol Mahum Clerics.<br1>
Ah,even Ol Mahums have a god they worship.<br1>
It is not the same god calledEin.<br1>
something that you guys believe in.<br1>
But, having a god forthemselves won't change their natural temperament, will it? They wouldrather kill than eat.<br1>
Whenever they get into a fight, they fretthemselves to death while trying to blow their enemies' heads off.<br1>
If anOl Mahum feels threatened he will not hesitate to run away and healhimself.<br1>
They are the kind of people who always leave a bad taste inyour mouth.<br1>
