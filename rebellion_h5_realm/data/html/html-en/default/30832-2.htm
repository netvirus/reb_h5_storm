There are a lot of people with prejudices about necromancers.<br1>
However, necromancy magic, which is performed by necromancers -- isdivided into the lines of healing magic and resurrection magic dependingon the person.<br1>
This is a field of study with a deep history that hasbeen passed down since the titan era.<br1>
In short, a necromancer is aperson that studies the lives of humans and other living beings.<br1>
Humansare instinctively afraid of blood.<br1>
And that seems to be the reason thatnecromancers are misunderstood in a variety of ways.<br1>
If you areinterested in necromancers or necromancy, you may be able to find theway to it here.<br1>
