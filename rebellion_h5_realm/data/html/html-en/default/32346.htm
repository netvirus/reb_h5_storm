Shh! Please quieter.<br1>
Behind me there is an old town, it is theonly entrance to the Steel Citadel.<br1>
Now it is a camp for prisoners.<br1>
Notso long ago, when the Steel Citadel temporarily weaken its defense, weattacked the town to rescue the prisoners.<br1>
However, the enemies werevery strong, and many of us were killed or wounded.<br1>
