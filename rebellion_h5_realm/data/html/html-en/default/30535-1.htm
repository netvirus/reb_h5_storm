The Gray Column Guild is an association of architects andminers, who hold the secrets of geometry, measurement, construction andmechanics that our ancestors learned from Maphr.<br1>
Our mine engineersdeveloped the enormous mining region of the Spine Mountains, and ourarchitects built the great underground labyrinth of Mlan.<br1>
Our guild alsoruns strip mines in this village and in the Mithril Mines.<br1>
But if youthink that we just build tunnels all the time, you are mistaken.<br1>
Ourguild also dispatches scouts to find new veins, and we cross the oceanto import precious metals like oriharukon and chrisolites from Gracia.<br1>
