For now, go out and hunt *crimson keltirs* , elder crimson keltirs orkasha wolves northwest of the village.<br1>
Wolves are the most dangerous, sowatch out.<br1>
Leave the village by the north or south gate and climb downthe hill.<br1>
You can't miss them.<br1>
When you target a monster, the monster'sname appears in the upper central portion of the screen.<br1>
*The colour ofthe name tells you the* *monster's difficulty* .<br1>
For now, hunt thosethat appear in white or sky blue.<br1>
Those that appear in red or yellow aremuch stronger than you, so leave them alone.<br1>
And I warn you, don't tryto tangle with the goblins yet.<br1>
Goblins are smarter and stronger thanyou think, but the most dangerous thing is that they know aboutteamwork.<br1>
If you attack one, several others may come to its aid.<br1>
Even ifyou might have a chance against a single goblin, you won't be able tostand against two or three.<br1>
