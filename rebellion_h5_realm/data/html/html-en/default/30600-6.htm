Speak to *Master Harant* or Master Trudy, and they will reveal tehskills and spells you may learn.<br1>
You must understand that skills aredivided into active skills and passive skills.<br1>
*Active* *skills* must beselected each time they are used, while passive skills provide apermanent increase to your basic abilities when they're obtained.<br1>
As aDark Fighter, you can acquire skills that increase your abilities.<br1>
.<br1>
Whenyou reach Level 5, learn offensive active skills.<br1>
*Power Strike, MortalBlow, and Power* *Shot* are the first three offensive active skills youmay learn.<br1>
Power Strike may only be used with sword type weapons, MortalBlow with dagger types, and Power shot with bow type weapons.<br1>
PowerShot, in particular, can cause great damage, but consumes great amountsof MP, so use it wisely.<br1>
Ginally, if you have a few spare SP, thenlearning *Aura Defense* may be a good idea.<br1>
This skill increases yourdefense, and is especially useful at your current levels, when yourequipment is still rather weak.<br1>
