Begin by hunting keltirs, elder keltirs or wolves near the village.<br1>
Thewolves are the most dangerous, so take care.<br1>
When you target a monster,the monster's name appears in teh upper central portion of the screen.<br1>
The colour of the name tells you the monster's difficulty.<br1>
For now, huntthose that appear in white or sky blue.<br1>
Those that appear in red oryello are much stronger than you, so leave them alone.<br1>
And I warn you,don't try to tangle with the orcs yet.<br1>
Orcs are smarter and stonger thanyou think, but the most dangerous thing is that they know about teamwork-- if you attack one, several others may come to its aid.<br1>
Even if youmigt have a chance against a single orc, you won't be able to standagainst two or three.<br1>
