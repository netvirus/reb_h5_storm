Buzz the Cat Pumpkins grow by drinking pumpkin nectar! After planting aseed, if you pour the nectar on the pumpkin, it will grow quickly! Meow!After drinking enough nectar, the pumpkin will become big.<br1>
Then, if youhit it with a weapon, the pumpkin will crack open! But, there areseveral things you should be careful about! *First of all, if you hit itbefore it's fully grown*, it will wilt from lack of nutrition.<br1>
So becareful.<br1>
Meow! Also, since *a pumpkin has a tendency to run away*, youshould try to crack it open before it gets out of hand! Young pumpkinsthat are not fully grown will run off in 3 minutes and fully grownpumpkins will run away in a minute and 30 seconds! Meow! *Also, a largepumpkin can't be opened with a regular weapon!* Meow! I heard that thereis a *weapon called chrono something* that produces musical sounds whenyou hit it against something.<br1>
Only when you use that, you will be ableto crack open your pumpkin! *One last thing! Since it's not easy to opena large pumpkin by yourself*, you should find a friend who can help youopen it.<br1>
