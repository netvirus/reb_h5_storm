<font color="FF8000"><html><body>	Clan Trader Ilia:</font><br>
<br> There are many ways to increase your clan's reputation, from	capturing a castle or fortress in battle, to helping our wandering	newbies.<br1>
Protection a territory is also laudable, and in that spirit I	wish to make you an offer if you can bring me these items:	<br>	<font color="LEVEL">1 Blood Alliance</font> to prove that you have	successfully defended a castle,	<font color="LEVEL">10 Blood Oaths gained by preserving civic		order in a territory</font>, and finally	<font color="LEVEL">100 Knight's Epaulettes to prove that you		are invincible in battle</font>.<br1>
<br> Bring me these things, and I will personally see to it that	your reputation increases.<br1>
