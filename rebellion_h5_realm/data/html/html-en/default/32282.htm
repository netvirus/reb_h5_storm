Yikes! That was a surprise.<br1>
.<br1>
I'm sorry.<br1>
I didn't mean to actso shocked â€” it's just so unusual to see people in this area.<br1>
My nameis Yiyen, and I'm an archeologist searching for a magical ruin that maybe responsible for some strange phenomena on the Isle of Prayer.<br1>
Thankthe gods, I think I've finally found it.<br1>
It is called the *Dark CloudMansion*, if I have translated the name correctly.<br1>
