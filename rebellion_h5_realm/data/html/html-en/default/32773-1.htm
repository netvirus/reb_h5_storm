Ugh, where should I begin? There's a lot to say aboutthis place, none of it good.<br1>
But if you want to survive here, you'd dowell to listen.<br1>
The Seed of Annihilation is crawling with psychoticmonsters unlike anything you've seen before.<br1>
There are three clans.<br1>
orraces really, I can't tell that they have any social structure.<br1>
We callthem the *Bistakon, Cokrakon, and Reptilikon*.<br1>
They are quite distintfrom one another, but the one thing that unites them is a thirst forviolence and death.<br1>
