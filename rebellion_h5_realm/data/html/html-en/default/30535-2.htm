500 years ago at Mlan, when the great Kingdom of theDwarves was defeated by Humans and Orcs, the King himself fought againstthe invaders to the very last, to earn time for his people to takerefuge in the mountains.<br1>
Since then, the throne has been empty.<br1>
Althoughseniors of the Guild Association govern the kingdom for now, they areonly proxies of the king, and no one thinks they are the true rulers ofthe kingdom.<br1>
This is due to the legend of the king's return handed downamong the Dwarves.<br1>
Have you heard it? The legend says that some day adescendant of the king will be found, to expel all the oppressors andlead us to the new golden age .<br1>
