It is proper and praiseworthy to remain vigilant for new quests.<br1>
Is notyour ultimate purpose to fight for the good of all Elvenkind? I willtell you of all the quests I know of for Fighters at your level.<br1>

I can tell you thatthere are one-time quests that you may only complete once, but alsorepetitive quests that may be undertaken several times.<br1>
