Long ago, they say they sacrificed virginstothe sea, but times have changed and there isno sailor who keeps thistradition.<br1>
Instead, weset afloat a boat that contains a doll in theshapeof a Human maiden.<br1>
Now we have tomake that doll.<br1>
I've asked WarehouseKeeper Rolfe, who ishandy with his hands, to make the doll, but westillhave to make the dolls long hair.<br1>
For that, Ineed high quality fur yarn.<br1>
Hunt the keltris on the island and gather aboutten bundles of fur, thentake them to Cristle inthe next village.<br1>
You can find her at the wellinfront of the village warehouse.<br1>
Give the fur toCristal, and she willspin it into yarn.<br1>
Take theyarn and give it to Warehouse Keeper Rolfe.<br1>
Hewill probably finish the doll on the spot.<br1>
Assoon as the doll isfinished, bring it back to me.<br1>
I will give you a generous reward for yourlabor.<br1>
