There are many things we do not understand about the Seed.<br1>
What we do know is that its interior is vastly different from thecontinent on which we live.<br1>
We also know that its interior changesdepending on who its lord is.<br1>
In discussing the Seeds of Infinity andDestruction, think of the Seed of Infinity as a land of death controlledby undead lord and the Seed of Destruction as the land of Dragonkincontrolled by the lord of Dragonkin.<br1>
We are still attempting to learnmore about the other Seeds, but we expect the same conditions apply.<br1>
Since they appeared, even the topography of Gracia has been altered.<br1>
Theland has become poisonous, making it nearly impossible to move exceptvia airship or Aurabird.<br1>
We do not know if we can ever restore this landto its former state, but our immediate goal must be to defeat the lordsof the Seeds.<br1>
Once they have been vanquished, we can turn our attentionto reclaiming our land.<br1>
