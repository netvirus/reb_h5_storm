I suppose you're using the weapons and armour you were issued.<br1>
That'sunless you have rich friends, of course, eh? Whatever you have is finefor now.<br1>
Remember to pay attention to what you find while huntingmonsters -- you can find armour, and sometimes even weapons, in thewild.<br1>
If you're lucky, you might find *cloth shoes,* apprentice's shoesor a cloth cap.<br1>
You should have been given two weapons, a dagger and asquire's sword.<br1>
Perhaps you have already noticed that daggers and swordsperform differenty in battle.<br1>
the dagger is swift, but its accuracysuffers, while the suqire's sword is noticeably slower than the dagger,but strikes with greater accuracy.<br1>
Remember that different weapons maycall upon different skills in their use.<br1>
Either is a worthy weapon; itis up to you to decide which suits you best.<br1>
Come back when you havereached level 6 and we'll talk more about weapons.<br1>
