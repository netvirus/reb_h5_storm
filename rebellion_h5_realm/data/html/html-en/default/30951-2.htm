<br> The dimension vortex was invented by the ancients to allow	instantaneous teleportation within the tower walls.<br1>
<br> Activation requires a dimension stone.<br1>
Each floor is accessed	by different colored stones.<br1>
For instance, to move to the fifth floor,	you need a	<font color="LEVEL">Blue Dimension Stone</font>.<br1>
To go to the first	floor, you need a	<font color="LEVEL">Green Dimension Stone</font>.<br1>
<br> All of the dimension stones are quite rare, but especially	precious are the red ones.<br1>
These are favored by the Platinum tribe and	their angels, and are almost impossible to obtain.<br1>
