Meow~ You're really a lovable person.<br1>
<br>I'll definitely help you show your heart to the one who's precious toyou.<br1>
<br>If you use the<font color=LEVEL>Valentine Secret Spell</font>that I gave you, you can find out the<font color=LEVEL>way to make a special Valentine Cake</font>for the person you love~ meow~.<br1>
<br>If you register the Valentine Secret Spell as a recipe, then collect 10dark chocolates, 10 white chocolates, and 5 fresh creams, you can make acake.<br1>
It can fail sometimes, so pray for success in your heart~ meow~~<br>But, I can't give you the chocolates and fresh cream.<br1>
Some unknownmonsters took them after raiding the warehouse awhile ago.<br1>
<br>But with the courage that comes from making a gift for someone preciousto you, you should be able to retrieve the cake ingredients from themonsters.<br1>
