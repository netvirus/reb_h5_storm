The Hunter Union is just a union of Hunters.<br1>
But we are different from the ignoramus who the nobles' call 'Hunters'.<br1>
We are professionals, we continuously train our skills.<br1>
You will knowthe details soon.<br1>
The Hunter Union also has a some of thecharacteristics of an autonomy.<br1>
Even though Castle Aden has dispatchedGuards, we are able to defend ourselves with our own strength.<br1>
Not onlydo we know this, but the Guards also approve.<br1>
However, our townstubbornly wants the Guards to stay here.<br1>
It is a bit of a complicatedstory.<br1>
