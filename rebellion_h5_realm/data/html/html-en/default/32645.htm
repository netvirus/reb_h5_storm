<font color="FF8000">Officer Carrier Chandra:</font><br>
Alright! I can easily manage 200 boxes anhour! How about 300? Nothing gets the blood pumping like the prospect ofbreaking your own record! Huh? Were you there all along? Well, you'vegot a front row seat, my friend.<br1>
I'm the new *Carrier* here.<br1>
Our volumehas really picked up, so the guild decided to expand the operation.<br1>
Youdon't know what a Carrier does? In the simplest terms, it's a person whosends freight here and there.<br1>
Of course, in reality it's not nearly assimple as it sounds! And there are complications.<br1>
Sometimes other thingsget mixed in, things like *rats*.<br1>
