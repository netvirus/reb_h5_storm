This is basically the place for carrying out theresearch activities of Master Hardin and us students of his.<br1>
The Masterhates the dogmatism and elitist education of the Ivory Tower and so heleft there to establish this academy privately.<br1>
And he accepts studentslike me of ordinary birth that don't have remarkable talent at magic.<br1>
However, I still wonder if there might have been a reason that he leftthe Ivory Tower other than the one that he has told us students.<br1>
Well.<br1>
For example, perhaps he is developing a force to go up against the IvoryTower.<br1>
