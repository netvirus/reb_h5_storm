Ha, just kidding! The ferry doesn't charge a toll.<br1>
The boat makes a stop at Devil's Isle, goes around near Innandril Castlethen returns to Heine.<br1>
It is a very romantic cruise.<br1>
If you find a newlove, bring them for the ride.<br1>
You will have a lovely time together onour boat.<br1>
