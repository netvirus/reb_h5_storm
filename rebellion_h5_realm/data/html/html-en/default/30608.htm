Hello, stranger? Did you know? Dion used to be called as themost beautiful territory.<br1>
However, now it is a physically, andspiritually unclean land.<br1>
To those who have extrasensory perception, thecries of the spirits can be heard even at this very moment.<br1>
It isbecause those who have died unjustly couldn't find peace and rest sothat they still dwell in this land.<br1>
