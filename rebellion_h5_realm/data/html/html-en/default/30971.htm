<br> I am Doctor Orpheus.<br1>
I am a student and teacher of life and	death.<br1>
I am also an adventurer, a physician, and an inventor.<br1>
Now I	find myself drawn in yet another direction, towards the realm of	Shilen.<br1>
If you are interested, there is a position open on my	research staff.<br1>
You are welcome to apply for it, or perhaps.<br1>
Would	you like to volunteer to be a subject of my experiment? I would be	eternally grateful to you.<br1>
