Welcome to the Hunters' Village, youngfriend.<br1>
As you know, our village was first formed by Hunters.<br1>
But we donot stop other Hunters from hunting near our town.<br1>
We must help eachother, don't you think so too? However, there are too many young Huntersthese days who disregard the rules.<br1>
Even pointlessly fighting in thevillage.<br1>
To prevent any clashes I hope you follow these rules.<br1>
Neverhunt what another Hunter is hunting.<br1>
And never take what another Hunterhas captured.<br1>
Easy eh? I think these are the most basic rules not onlyHunters but every Human being must follow.<br1>
Don't you think so? I willkick the person who breaks these easy rules out of the village.<br1>
