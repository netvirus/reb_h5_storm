Tejakar Oroka! I am Toruku.<br1>
I teach Kabart, the Orcs'martial art.<br1>
Kabart is a martial art that trains your body to become adeadly weapon.<br1>
Orcs that train in this do not depend on common weaponssuch as swords or spears, but learn combat skills that involve onlyswift movements and precise blows.<br1>
Paagrio of the flame teaches that wemust continuously strive to strengthen ourselves to become stronger thanall life which has breath.<br1>
I have broken ties with the world and come tothis isolated wasteland to fulfill these teachings and concentrate onthe further training of Kabart.<br1>
