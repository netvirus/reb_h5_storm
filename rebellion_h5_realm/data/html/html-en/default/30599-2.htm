Consider where you wish to finish, and that will tell youwhere to start.<br1>
The Kingdom of Aden is in chaos, because they are at warwith Elmore, and with Gracia across the sea.<br1>
What better time will therebe to restore the Elven people to their ancient greatness? For now, themost important thing is to simply hone your skills in combat.<br1>
What couldbe a greater priority in this time of war? Begin your training byhunting *red keltirs* or *wolves* near the village.<br1>
Be cautious,particularly with the wolves, for they are very savage.<br1>
When you find anitem after slaying a monster, try to equip any armour or weapon, and seeif it's better than what you have now.<br1>
For the rest, if you have noother use for it, sell it at the stores, so you will have adena when youneed it.<br1>
