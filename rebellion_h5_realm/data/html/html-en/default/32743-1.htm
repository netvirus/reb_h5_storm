Most of the Leto Lizardmen died from the poisons ofthe plants found on the plains, but those who didn't seem to haveevolved into a new race called the Tanta Lizardmen.<br1>
However, I believethere are some Leto that are still living in an area outside the Plainsof the Lizardmen, avoiding the poisons and maintaining their originalappearance.<br1>
I think they live in the shadow of a hill *northeast of thePlains, near the road leading to the Hunter's Village.<br1>
* In fact, I'msure of it! I saw them myself.<br1>
