There are three plants that we're especially curiousabout.<br1>
Well, not all are plants - two are forms of fungus.<br1>
The FantasyMushroom, Stick Mushroom, and Energy Plant are extremely plentiful onthe Plains of the Lizardmen, but the strange thing is, they aren't foundanywhere else in the world.<br1>
