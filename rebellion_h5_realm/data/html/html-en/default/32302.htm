Welcome! I've been waiting for a long time for someone to comehere.<br1>
I have to tell you about a strong magical field in the Tower ofInfinitum.<br1>
If someone who does not belong to the demons will enter thetower, magical protection will tear to pieces anyone, but there is a wayaround this.<br1>
You have to pretend to be a demon.<br1>
If you want to do that,you have to kill the devil and cover your body with his blood .<br1>
