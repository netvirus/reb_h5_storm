I must kill them! I must kill them all! Huge mouth!Gigantic eyes! The rough sound of breathing! I still remembereverything.<br1>
Right in front of me, it opened its mouth and swallowed myparents and grandma.<br1>
Finally, it was about to lunge out to eat me!Then a Master Raider appeared all of a sudden and saved my life.<br1>
