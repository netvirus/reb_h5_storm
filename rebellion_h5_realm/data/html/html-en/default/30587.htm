Hear, young Orc!! Let me explain the origin of ourrace! In the beginning, there was Paagrio of the flame, and from the hotflame Paagrio brought forth the the father of the Orcs.<br1>
His hair was ared blaze, his eyes a pure white flame, ashen smoke rushed out of hisnose and mouth as he breathed, and in his veins boiled blood hotter thanlava! Because of all this, he was mightier than any other living thing!But when he came down from the heavens, the heat of his body began tocool, because of the force of the water.<br1>
His lava blood began to harden,because of the force of the earth.<br1>
His smoke was scattered, because ofthe force of the wind.<br1>
The father of the Orcs was miserable because hehad lost his original strength, but the god Paagrio taught him that ifhe continuously trained his body through discipline and combat, he couldbecome strong again.<br1>
