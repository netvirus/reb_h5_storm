I am Priest Kanis, and I serve the great Shamaness Parmeof the Crystal Oracle, who offered herself as a sacrifice in order toappease the Water Dragon Fafurion.<br1>
Several days ago, Demons, crazedsevants of the Water Dragon and Crystal Golems attacked the Oracle.<br1>
Itwas completely destroyed, and the people of the Oracle were killed orcaptured.<br1>
Only I was able to escape to seek help.<br1>
