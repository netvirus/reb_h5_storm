The town's geographical features? Oh my.<br1>
What a lazy chap.<br1>
Have you no legs? Even if you already know, the townis to the north-west, and to the south-east.<br1>
It is divided up into 2large areas like this.<br1>
The shops are lined up above, and several guildsare situated on the bottom.<br1>
These 2 areas are divided by a great canyon,and if you happen to fall into it, you will have a hard time climbingback up.<br1>
So be careful.<br1>
There are 2 bridges that connect the northernand southern part of the town.<br1>
In the past, the King accused us being ofbeing a band of bandits.<br1>
When he came to subjugate us, my grandfatherand father disconnected the two bridges and fought for over 3 monthsuntil the King gave up.<br1>
It was Duke Athebaldt, who made peace betweenthe Hunters' Union and the King.<br1>
Why.<br1>
, you do know, right? Did you notknow? The son of the Duke is a Guildmaster at our town.<br1>
I'm talkingabout Aren! He is quite a nice guy, even though he is from a noblefamily.<br1>
