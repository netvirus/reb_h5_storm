Needless to say, in order to make a Dualsword, you first need twoswords.<br1>
They can be either Superior weapons, Common weapons orMasterwork weapons.<br1>
Superior weapons can only be combined with otherSuperior weapons, Common weapons can only be combined with other Commonweapons, and Masterwork weapons can only be combined with otherMasterwork weapons.<br1>
Additionally, a Masterwork Dualsword can be madeonly using swords above B grade.<br1>
Since I must make a living, I do chargea small fee.<br1>
And since a fire is needed and the cost of fuel is sohigh.<br1>
Hmm.<br1>
As you probably know, it's extremely difficult to handlea Dualsword without training and coordination.<br1>
This is also why only thesame grade swords can be combined.<br1>
I can combine swords up to grade C.<br1>
If you want something better, you'd better go to a bigger city.<br1>
Rememberas well that an Enchanted weapon loses its effect once it is combinedwith another.<br1>
Don't forget Oh, one more thing.<br1>
If you invest some kindof a skill in a weapon, it won't work.<br1>
I'm afraid that it simply can'tbe combined with another.<br1>
