<font color="36DC25">Shilen's Stone Statue:</font><br>
You know that in the past, Mother Shilen paid agreat sacrifice to lock Sailren here.<br1>
Afterward, she created a stonelikeness of herself and bestowed upon it the power to seal, making it aguardian of this place to ensure that Sailren remained imprisoned.<br1>
I amthe stone statue of Shilen.<br1>
Mother Shilen also entrusted the power toseal to those who wield the sacred ax Gazkh.<br1>
I will only open the gatefor those who have Gazkh and their friends.<br1>
When the seal is at itsweakest, however, I allow a warrior to enter in order to minimize thesacrifice.<br1>
There are not many of them, but Sailren is protected by itsdinosaur followers.<br1>
Combined with my enchantment and the power of theother statues, we are restraining Sailren and its followers fromescaping.<br1>
But as they begin to break free of our control, their powerand magic also begins to extend beyond the Lost Nest, affecting even thePrimeval Plains! If the power of the Stone Statues are completelybroken, Sailren and its followers will escape and this island andeverything on it will perish.<br1>
Alas, Shilen is not here to protect us! Inorder to re-seal that horrifying dinosaur, you must defeat its followersfirst, and then work as a team to defeat Sailren.<br1>
