*Earth Worm Trasken* was one of the wickeddevils created by *Shilen* , the goddess of darkness and death.<br1>
Longago, when Shunaiman, the king of Elmoreden, was building the Seal ofShilen, Earth Worm Trasken escaped from King Shunaiman, the tales tellus.<br1>
It is said that Trasken settled here, and was sleeping deep withinthe Spine Mountains, where we live now.<br1>
So our ancestors, who had noidea about the sleeping Trasken, made a tragic mistake, and awoke theEarth Worm while collecting mithril.<br1>
That devil, newly roused from deepslumber, was too powerful for the armies of the Dwarves.<br1>
The Earth Wormdestroyed the village and killed Dwarves mercilessly.<br1>
We Dwarves wereabout to be massacred! However, Hero Lucien, who was born with theblessing of Maphr, suddenly appeared with his people! *Carna Maphr*Praise the goddess -- she did not abandon us! Hero Lucien defeated thewicked Earth Worm with his fighting skills and divine courage.<br1>
Butlisten, for this must always be remembered! Although Earth Worm Traskenhas died, *Earth Worm Trasken's egg* is still alive somewhere deep inthe Spine Mountains.<br1>
Shilen's followers are, even now, trying to revivethe Earth Worm.<br1>
