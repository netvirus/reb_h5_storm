<br> A while back we were visited by investigators from the Ivory	Tower.<br1>
Their scroll of teleport would not function properly here,	leading them to surmise that the area around the tower is mysteriously	warped.<br1>
This was likely done by the original designers of the tower in	order to prevent invaders from using teleportation to move troops	within the tower.<br1>
<br> The only teleportation device that works well here is the	dimension vortex.<br1>
We have not determined why it works while other modes	of teleportation do not.<br1>
Dimension stones allow movement between	floors.<br1>
For example, if you want to go to the	<font color="LEVEL">10th floor</font>, you need a	<font color="LEVEL">Red Dimension Stone</font>.<br1>
To return to the	<font color="LEVEL">first floor</font>, you will need a	<font color="LEVEL">Green Dimension Stone</font>.<br1>
<br> Unfortunately the demons have discovered the dimension	vortex, and are in a frenzy trying to collect all the dimension stones	they can find.<br1>
I suppose they want to control all movement within the	tower.<br1>
If you need a dimension stone, you must take one from a demon.<br1>
It will not be easy.<br1>
I wish you luck.<br1>
