<font color="36DC25">Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:</font><br>
It s nice to meet you young man.<br1>
My name isGustaf Athebaldt.<br1>
I am a knight of the royal bodyguards.<br1>
Although I willsoon retire, when I see the current state of affairs, I worry so muchabout the future of this kingdom that I don t think I will be able toretire comfortably.<br1>
I don t think I can trust the future of thisnation in the hands of kings or lords.<br1>
Lords are always busy pursuingand satisfying their own self-interest and gratification.<br1>
And the kingalways looks away from his people s hardships.<br1>
So, how would you expectthem to be concerned about the nation s welfare? If you think idly thatit does not matter who rules over the country, you will find yourself inno time groaning under the harsh tyranny of a despot.<br1>
In my opinion,although we may have to go through hellish wars and tribulations, wemust restore the order of the nation.<br1>
