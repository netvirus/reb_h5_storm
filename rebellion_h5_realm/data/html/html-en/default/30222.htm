Greetings, I am Alshupes, a moneylender.<br1>
My Elven brothersmay criticize me for lending money, but I don't care.<br1>
They say they'reashamed of me as an Elf or something .<br1>
Who says they're not right? Butin times like these, don't they know that one needs money aboveanything, even if one is an Elf? Don't you think so? Oh, and by the way,don't think about borrowing money from me.<br1>
These days I'm thinking of a*new business* so I'm putting a hold on money lending.<br1>
I should gopursue sales in a Human village or something .<br1>
