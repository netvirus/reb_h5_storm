Airship, eh? If you want board an Airship, you need tofirst register for a Summon License.<br1>
There's a switch on the Airshipcontrols that proves your qualifications to summon and pilot it.<br1>
Unlessyou obtain that license, you won't be allowed to fly.<br1>
Only *clan lordswhose clan is level 5 or higher* may earn the license.<br1>
There is also alimit on the number of Airships.<br1>
If you meet the requirements, you canobtain a Airship Summon License in exchange for *10 Energy Star Stones*.<br1>
An Energy Star Stone can be made by assembling Star Stones foundfloating in the skies over Gracia.<br1>
If you thinkk this is tootime-consuming, you can also buy them from Officer Tolonis right overthere.<br1>
