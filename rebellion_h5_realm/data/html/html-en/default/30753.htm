Giran, land of riches, is a place that appears bright andvital on the outside.<br1>
But if you look carefully at the faces of thepeople that live there, you can see their dark shadows.<br1>
That's becauseland dragon Antharas, who is called the tyrant of the land and disasterof Giran, is laying in Dragon Valley.<br1>
If he stretches out and leave hislair, the prosperity and peace of that land will be broken completely.<br1>
