Kamael have 3 skills, which are selected in thesecond class transfer.<br1>
The first is a combat skill with a Short Sword,and allows you to wield the Sword in one hand while controlling yourinnate magic with the other.<br1>
Those who master this skill are called*Soul Breakers*.<br1>
The second skill allows you to use ancient Swordtechniques to focus your inner strength and cause tremendous damage toyour enemy.<br1>
Only male Kamael may learn this skill.<br1>
Those who do arecalled *Berserkers*.<br1>
The final skill deals with hunting and spiritualattributes that allow the wielder to attack the enemy when and wherethey least expect it.<br1>
That skill is reserved only for female Kamael,however, so I cannot say more about it.<br1>
