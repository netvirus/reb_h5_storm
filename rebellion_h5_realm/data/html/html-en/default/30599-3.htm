You should have been given two weapons -- a *dagger* and a *Squire'sSword*.<br1>
Perhaps you have already noticed that daggers and swords performdifferently in battle.<br1>
The dagger is swift, but its accuracy suffers,while the squire's sword is noticeably slower than the dagger, butstrikes with greater accuracy.<br1>
Remember that different weapons may callupon different skills in their use.<br1>
Either is a worthy weapon; it is upto you to decide which suits you best.<br1>
When you have saved around 500adena, buy a *Bone Dagger* if that's what you prefer, or a *short sword*if swords are more to your taste.<br1>
You may be able to improve your armourfrom the spoils of te monsters you slay, but that is a matter of luck.<br1>
If you reach level 5 and are still lacking gloves, shoes or a helmet,you should consider purchasing the cheapest ones offered by the store.<br1>
When you reach level 6 return to me, and we will speak of this subjectin more depth.<br1>
