<font color="FF8000">Alchemist Matild:</font><br>
Don't you think it's pure prejudice to say thatDwarves can't use magic? I have been interested in alchemy ever since Iwas young and even went for study at the Ivory Tower.<br1>
And I left schoolbecause of an unavoidable situation.<br1>
No, I had to quit in the middleof my studies but still I studied really hard while I was there.<br1>
