*Gran Kain* -- Sovereign of Destruction, FatherofDarkness! If the sunnlight that pierces oureyes was made by Einhasad,then thedarkness that swallows the light wass made bythe Dark Lord, GranKain.<br1>
Other races call GranKain a devil, fear him and exclude hisfollowers.<br1>
However, as the late afternoon shadow slowlyovertakes theland, the power of Gran Kain willsurpass all other gods -- and when thelight isput out, flames extinguished, and the winddies, the ground willpart and all rivers andoceans will become dry.<br1>
Then, only darknesswillremain.<br1>
