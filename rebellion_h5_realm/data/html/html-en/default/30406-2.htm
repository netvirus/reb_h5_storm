You don't know about Oren's Ivory Tower? Oren's Ivory Tower wasbuilt in the days of the Ancient Kingdom of Elmoreden, and is the chieftemple of magic.<br1>
These days its authority isn't what it once was, butstill, most decent Mystics are trained there.<br1>
Also, there is a rumorthat a mysterious gem in the lower level that magnifies the power ofmagic, but no one claims to have actually seen it.<br1>
I cannot say if thisis true, since I have not seen it either.<br1>
