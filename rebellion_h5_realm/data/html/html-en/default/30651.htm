Maphr as the goddess of abundance and prosperity?!Foolish people, they don't know anything! Just look at the silly Dwarvesof this town! They are literally crazy and they are always dashing hereand there to collect more money.<br1>
Ridiculous! Miserable creatures whowould even venture to scrape out their goddess's heart if it were formoney! And they won't hesitate to uncover things that were never meantto be in this world! Maphr is indeed the goddess of abundance andprosperity, but that also means that she is responsible for all povertyand downfalls! Why can't you see this simple fact? They have alreadyexperienced bankruptcy once before.<br1>
Tsk tsk.<br1>
