<br> It is a pleasure to meet you.<br1>
I am Paagrio Guardian Vulkus in	the Temple of Paagrio.<br1>
Orcs once ruled the world and all its races, but	now we live on the plateau, because of the power of the Humans.<br1>
<br> Yet it is inevitable that the Orcs will rise again, just as	it is inevitable that the everlasting flame of Paagrio will continue to	burn.<br1>
