<font color="36DC25">Mercenary Sophia:</font><br>
Hello traveler with a fresh face.<br1>
It s nice to meetyou.<br1>
My name is Sophia, commander of the 4th platoon of the Black LionMercenary Troop.<br1>
Our platoon has been hired by the mayor of Dion CastleTown.<br1>
Currently, we are assigned with the task of driving out evilspirits from Dion Castle Town and its surrounding areas.<br1>
But the evilspirits in this area are too numerous for our platoon to deal with byourselves and we are struggling right now.<br1>
If you are planning to travelto Gludio or Giran region, you had better prepare yourself for an attackby an Enku Orc or a Dire Wolf.<br1>
