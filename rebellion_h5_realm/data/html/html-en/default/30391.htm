Are you learned?<br1>
The world is made of *light and darkness* and four elements.<br1>
Those four are no other than *water, fire, wind and earth.*<br1>
All magic in this world is based on the powers of these six principles.<br1>
That is why it is important, above anything else, for Mystics to understand the powers of that which composes this world.<br>
