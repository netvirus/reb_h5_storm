Do you know the continent of Gracia? It is locatedfar across the sea from Aden, it is the barren land with the roughclimate.<br1>
It was the home of a strong, hardy people.<br1>
But now all haschanged.<br1>
Strange Seads appeared thoughout the continent, spawningPagan Mosters who wreaked havok on the land.<br1>
Although we fought underthe command of King Keucereus, we were outmatched.<br1>
Gracia fell under thesway of that great evil.<br1>
Fortunately, a few survivors were able to reachAden and ask for help.<br1>
There your clan leaders promised to sentassistance.<br1>
Since then, our soldiers have formed a combined force underthe command of King Keucereus, waiting for our chance to exact vengeanceon those who destroyed our homes.<br1>
A few of my comrades stayed behind inAden to appeal to other adventurers for help.<br1>
