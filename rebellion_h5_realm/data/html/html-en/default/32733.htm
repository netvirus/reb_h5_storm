It's been a long time since part of our fleetcrashlanded into the *Seed of Annihilation*.<br1>
I'm told the Seed aboundswith a plethora of strange organisms that might be worthy of study ifthey weren't so dangerous.<br1>
Unfortunately that's all a null point anywaybecause right now, our priority is to get able bodies out there to helpbring back lost soldiers and repair the fleet.<br1>
I came back to Kucereus'Outpost alone to recruit those that seem strong enough to make it out inthere.<br1>
