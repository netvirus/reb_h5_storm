As you are no doubt aware this tower is the greatestachievement of Baium, the last king of the Elmoreden Empire.<br1>
It was afeat unimaginable to even the most advanced Human architects of thattime.<br1>
Baium kidnapped 10 Elven architects and forced them to design thisspectacular tower.<br1>
When construction was complete he ordered theexecutions of all who worked on it, from the Elven architects all theway down to the lowliest laborer.<br1>
This insured that no one would everdiscover the secret of the tower.<br1>
This stroke of brutal genius worked asintended.<br1>
The secret has been lost for millenia.<br1>
The Gray Pillar Guildbecame determined to unlock the secret of the tower, and dispatched ateam of researchers to investigate.<br1>
