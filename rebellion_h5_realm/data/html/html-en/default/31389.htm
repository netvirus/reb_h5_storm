<br> Strange things have been happening to me lately.<br1>
When I	wake up I find scars I don't remember getting.<br1>
Things broken I don't	remember breaking.<br1>
<br> I wonder.<br1>
could I be sleepwalking? I don't remember a	thing!.<br1>
<br> Oh, hello, traveler! Sorry to tell you this, but there's no	place to stay in this village! Violet over there is selling some odd	items, but other than that.<br1>
this is, well, a ghost town!	<br> If only I could.<br1>
Sigh.<br1>
