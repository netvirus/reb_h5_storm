<font color="FF8000">Earthdragon Watcher Gilmore:</font><br>
The core of the magic force field is agateway that was created by those who locked away Antharas.<br1>
A *portalstone* acts as a key to enter it.<br1>
Another *earthdragon watcher,Theodric* is in charge of the portal stone and gives it only toauthorized seal watchers.<br1>
If you would like to get a hold of a portalstone, first go see seal watcher Gabrielle.<br1>
After you have been approvedby her, come back and see me.<br1>
