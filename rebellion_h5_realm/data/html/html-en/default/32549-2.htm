Our enemy currently controls the Seed of Infinity.<br1>
Keucereus'clan cannot enter unless we first attack.<br1>
We can assault either the Hallof Suffering or the Hall of Erosion.<br1>
We must destroy the tumors of deathand kill the cursed twin knights, Yehan Klodekus and Yehan Klanikus, inthe Hall of Suffering.<br1>
Be advised that they become stronger the furtherapart from each other they are.<br1>
Destroy the tumors of death in the Hallof Erosion and kill Cohemenes and Argekunte, who share one soul throughan infernal contract.<br1>
They are masters of ancient Gracian magic, butthere is a limit to the spells that they can cast at the same time.<br1>
Keepthat in mind when you carry out an assault.<br1>
The road that leads toEkimus will stay open as long as you defeat his followers in the twohalls and his influence weakens.<br1>
