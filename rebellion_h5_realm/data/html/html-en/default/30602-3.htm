I suppose you're using the weapons and armour you were issued by thePriests of Paagrio, That's unless you have rich friends, of course, eh?Whatever you have is fine for now.<br1>
Remember to pay attention to what youfind while hunting monsters - you can find armour, and sometimes evenweapons, in the wild.<br1>
If you're lucky, you might find *cloth shoes,apprentice's shoes, or* *a cloth cap* .<br1>
You should have been given twoweapons, a squire's sword and training gloves.<br1>
Even a novice like youcan tell the difference between a sword and a brawling weapon, I think.<br1>
The *training gloves (hand-to-hand weapon)* hit twice as often as otherweapons, but they're not as powerful.<br1>
Plus, you need both hands, soforget about a shield.<br1>
Now the squire's sword (one-handed sword) is muchsower than the gloves, but is more accurate and does more damage.<br1>
Remember that different weapons may call upon different skills in theiruse.<br1>
Either is a worth weapon - it is up to you to decide which suitsyou best.<br1>
Come back when you reach *level 6* and we'll talk more aboutweapons.<br1>
