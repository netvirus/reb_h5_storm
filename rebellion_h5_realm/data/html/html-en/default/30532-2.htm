Elmore is a kingdom of Humans which dominates thenorthern part of the continent.<br1>
They are, as a rule, unpleasant fellowswho think Dwarves are inferior.<br1>
They have all too often dispatched anarmy on some pretext or other, in actuality to meddle in our domesticadministration and antagonize us in many ways.<br1>
But now we have manytreaties, so they don't bother us anymore.<br1>
Of course, the Kingdom of theDwarves pays tribute to the Kingdom of Elmore, but that is only fairbecause Elmore prevents the Orcs, who can always invade us from thewest, from attacking us.<br1>
