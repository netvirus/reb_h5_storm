<font color="36DC25">Gatekeeper Batracos:</font><br>
There's something about this place, an unescapablefeeling of peace.<br1>
I used to know that feeling very well here.<br1>
Unfortunately, the truth behind my people's past keeps me from enjoyingthat feeling anymore.<br1>
You see, the Plains have been showered with theblood of my people.<br1>
In the wake of Antharas' death, we struggled forthis land, bloodlust fueling brother against brother, father againstson.<br1>
<br>It was the Seer who united the new tribe of Tanta to defeat the Leto.<br1>
Heis known amongst my people as a great leader, but he also kills any whooppose him.<br1>
I can't just sit back and watch anymore.<br1>
But I won't sendsomeone to be slaughtered either.<br1>
