<br> The Seed of Destruction is essentially a gigantic fortress.<br1>
Throughout its corridors are barriers and doors controlled by several	devices guarded by Mounted Troop soldiers.<br1>
To penetrate into the	interior, you must attack those devices.<br1>
Even then, you'll need to	force open the doors.<br1>
<br>	<br> When you get inside, you'll see the fortress for yourself.<br1>
Since this is Tiat's last line of defense, there will be a large number	of Mounted Troop soldiers.<br1>
Defeat them and you'll reach the Throne Room	and Tiat herself.<br1>
<br>	<font color="LEVEL">A word of advice: move as quickly as		possible through the fortress.<br1>
The longer it takes you, the more		enemies will appear.<br1>
