The Elves of Innadril originally came here from theElven Forest around ED.<br1>
1200.<br1>
Tetrarch Terestien and his young followerssettled in the Emerald Forest near Innadril Lake.<br1>
This was the beginningof the Elven migration to Innadril.<br1>
Since our peoples share a devotionto the goddess we have always gotten along well.<br1>
Over time intermarriagebetween the races has given most of the people of this area some Elvenancestry.<br1>
This has enhanced both their beauty and lifespan.<br1>
