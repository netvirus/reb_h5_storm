Skills are not learned just once.<br1>
They can be upgraded continuouslythrough the use of SP.<br1>
If you have learned the first level of PowerStrike, you should gather 60 SP and upgrade to level 2.<br1>
Since everyskill can be upgraded, it is up to you whether to become an expert in asingle skill by concentrating your SP on it, or to become a generalistwho learns skills at a lower level.<br1>
