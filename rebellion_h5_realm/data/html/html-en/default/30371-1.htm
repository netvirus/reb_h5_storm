Actually, I myself do not know the details.<br1>
According to what I've heard, we Elves used forbidden magic while fighting with the Humans, who had betrayed us, and as a result a large area of land became a wasteland.<br1>
The polluted land is called the *Sea of Spores*, and it keeps growing even today. At this rate, it may even swallow up the Elven Forest someday.<br1>
It is ironic that only the power of the Humans is blocking the expansion of the Sea of Spores.<br1>
In that sense, the Sea of Spores is the consequence of the mistake that we Elves made.
