Actually, I myself do not know the details.<br1>
According to whatI've heard, we Elves used forbidden magic while fighting with theHumans, who had betrayed us, and as a result a large area of land becamea wasteland.<br1>
The polluted land is called the *Sea of Spores*, and itkeeps growing even today.<br1>
At this rate, it may even swallow up the ElvenForest someday.<br1>
It is ironic that only the power of the Humans isblocking the expansion of the Sea of Spores.<br1>
In that sense, the Sea ofSpores is the consequence of the mistake that we Elves made.<br1>
