Greetings, traveler.<br1>
I am Jonas, a cook from Giran.<br1>
I have cometo participate in the *cooking contest* that is to be held here.<br1>
Thiscooking contest holds a great significance for me.<br1>
Traditionally, themen of my family have taken the path of the knight, but I refused thattradition and chose the way of the cook.<br1>
From childhood I had no skillwith the sword, but loved cooking more than anything else.<br1>
But my fathercould not understand.<br1>
I was overwhelmed with frustration, and in myanger, declared that I would rather attain fame by becoming the greatestcook in all the land rather than a country knight that no oneacknowledges, and then I left home.<br1>
From then on, I've worked for morethan ten years under many famous chefs and learn all their arts.<br1>
I amdetermined to do well in this contest, and receive acknowledgement as achef.<br1>
That is the only way I will ever be able to face my family again.<br1>
