Pirate King Zaken once lived here.<br1>
But it's beensaid that he may have allied himself with the invaders from the DreamWorld, which is why adventurers seeking to challenge him now cannot findhim.<br1>
We believe that he has now created a giant Dream Dimension bydrawing on the power of night.<br1>
Because of that, Zaken was separated intotwo individuals, a corporeal one during the day and the other one duringthe night.<br1>
He is more powerful now than ever, and he has been attackingthe real world from the Dream Dimension.<br1>
