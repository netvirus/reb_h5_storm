I'll tell you about all teh quests I know of, but I don't know aboutthem all.<br1>
You should talk to all the villagers you can.<br1>
First, you seethis young fellow here nexxt to me? His name is Darin, and he seems tobe worried about something.<br1>
wht don't you see if he could use your help?He could at least use someone to talk to, I think.<br1>
Also, Guard Arnold,stationed at the south gate of the village, is looking for someone todeliver items he recovered from a shipwreck.<br1>
I belive he'd willing topay, so see what you can do for him.<br1>
Have you been to the weapon shopyet? Trader Lector, Keeper of the weapon store, is a famousleatherworker, I'm told he's making something out of wolf pelts.<br1>
Sinceyou're hunting wolves anyway, why don't you work with Lector andincrease you profits? He can fill you in on the details.<br1>
