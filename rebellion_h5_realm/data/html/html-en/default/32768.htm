I kept hearing so many rumors about the skill of those whoinhabit the Beast Farm that I just had to see the talent for myself.<br1>
Andwhen I get here, what do I find? A bunch of foul smelling, drooling,hideously deformed creatures.<br1>
and I'm not talking about the monstersroaming the grounds of the Beast Farm.<br1>
All I see are a bunch of notalent, rowdy, trouble-making drunkards who don't know the slightest bitabout skill.<br1>
