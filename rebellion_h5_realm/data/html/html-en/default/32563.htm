Welcome to Keucereus Alliance Base.<br1>
We need all thesoldiers we can get.<br1>
Your missions here will be mainly in the sky.<br1>
Myadvice is to obtain an Airship, but I see some adventurers from Adenalso fight using their ability of transformation.<br1>
Go ask Engineer Lekonabout which method is best for you.<br1>
If you want to know about our enemy,talk to Admiral Keucereus or General Dilios.<br1>
