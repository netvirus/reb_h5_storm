Employee of Magic Research Institute Watermeleons grow by drinkingnectar! After planting a seed, if you pour the nectar on theWatermeleon, it will grow quickly! After drinking enough nectar, theWatermeleon will become big.<br1>
Then, if you hit it with a weapon, theWatermeleon will crack open! But, there are several things you should becareful about! *First of all, if you hit it before it's fully grown,* itwill wilt from lack of nutrition.<br1>
So be careful.<br1>
Also, since *aWatermeleon has a tendency to run away*, you should try to crack it openbefore it gets out of hand! Young Watermeleons that are not fully grownwill run off in 3 minutes and fully grown Watermeleons will run away ina minute and 30 seconds! *Also, a large Watermeleon can't be opened witha regular weapon!* I heard that there is a *weapon called chronosomething* that produces musical sounds when you hit it againstsomething.<br1>
Only when you use that, you will be able to crack open yourWatermeleon! *One last thing! Since it's not easy to open a largeWatermeleon by yourself,* you should find a friend who can help you openit.<br1>
