Next to the Elven Forest is the region of Oren where Humanslive.<br1>
There is also the *Sea of Spores*.<br1>
However, there is a mountainrange between the Elven Forest and Oren, so we can't pass freely.<br1>
Theplace called the Sea of Spores was once a battlefield of the great warbetween Elves and Men.<br1>
Before that, it was a beautiful place, but thebattle magic of the war polluted the ground, and the blight grows widereven to this very day.<br1>
They say the Mystics at the *Ivory Tower* haveset up force fields that are just barely sufficient to contain theblight.<br1>
In the fight between us Elves and the Humans, nature was theultimate loser.<br1>
