Nice to meet you, young friend! My name is Martian.<br1>
I am thesecurity manager of the Traders' Guild of Giran.<br1>
The traders work hardto accumulate their wealth, but there are always those who lust afterthe profits of others.<br1>
It is especially true in places like here, whichis the center of the continent's economy.<br1>
Bugbear pillagers, Orc gangs,ratmen thieves.<br1>
The troops that I have hired can barely rest, as theymust protect the traders' riches from those gangs day and night.<br1>
