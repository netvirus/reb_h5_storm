<br> The strong body and combat might of the Orc warriors cannot	be obtained without effort.<br1>
You can gain these only through the most	difficult training imaginable: Kabart, tre drill of eternity.<br1>
Those who	achieve the combat skills of Kabart will earn the title of Monk.<br1>
<br> Those who master everything about the higher art of Kabart,	the motion of the body and its relation to the universe, will be	granted the title of Tyrant.<br1>
There is another rank higher than even	this, but it has been sealed for a long time and is no longer granted.<br1>
Its powers has been long forgotten.<br1>
