Collector Pippi The mine useds to be a vast expanse consisting ofhundreds of tunnels, but most of them were destroyed after the attack ofthe *Earth Worm* and he mithril is collected from very few tunnels now.<br1>
Currently, our guild is working to restore destroyed tunnels and greatlyincrease the output of the mithril.<br1>
This plan has been delayed, though,because our timid elders are afraid the the Earth Worm might regainconsciousness.<br1>
Maybe it's because they are old, but they are allcowards.<br1>
