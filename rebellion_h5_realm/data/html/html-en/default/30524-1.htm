<font color="FFFF00">Collector Pippi:</font><br>
The mine useds to be a vast expanse consisting of hundreds of tunnels, but most of them were destroyed after the attack of the *Earth Worm* and he mithril is collected from very few tunnels now.<br>
Currently, our guild is working to restore destroyed tunnels and greatly increase the output of the mithril.<br1>
This plan has been delayed, though, because our timid elders are afraid the the Earth Worm might regain consciousness.<br1>
Maybe it's because they are old, but they are all cowards.<br1>
Pippi could take care of that Earth Worm with one fist!<br>
