Hello.<br1>
I am Thalia, guardian of The Mother Tree Glade.<br1>
I am ingreat distress because The Mother Tree is withering.<br1>
Perhaps it isbecause of the force that drifts out of the Sea of Spores and crossesover those mountains.<br1>
The saddest thing is that these things were causedbecause we used *forbidden magic* during the war with the Humans a longtime ago.<br1>
