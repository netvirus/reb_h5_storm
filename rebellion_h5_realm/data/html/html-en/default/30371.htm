Hello. I am Thalia, guardian of The Mother Tree Glade.<br1>
I am in great distress because The Mother Tree is withering.<br1>
Perhaps it is because of the force that drifts out of the Sea of Spores and crosses over those mountains.<br1>
The saddest thing is that these things were caused because we used *forbidden magic* during the war with the Humans a long time ago.<br>
