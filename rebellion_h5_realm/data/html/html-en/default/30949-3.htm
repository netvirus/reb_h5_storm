Don't you get it?! This tower is itself abattleground! I don't know what is on the top floor, only that there aremany who seek it.<br1>
Worst among them are<font color="LEVEL"> Death Lord Hallate and his legion</font>.<br1>
Hallate is responsible for the destruction of the force field thatonce protected the tower.<br1>
<br>The<font color="LEVEL">Platinum tribe</font>and<font color="LEVEL">angels</font>have guarded the tower for hundreds of years, but recently have beendriven from the lower levels by Hallate and his minions.<br1>
Thankfully theystill control the upper floors.<br1>
You mustn't think of these guardiansas our allies, however.<br1>
To them we are just more invaders to be dealtwith.<br1>
