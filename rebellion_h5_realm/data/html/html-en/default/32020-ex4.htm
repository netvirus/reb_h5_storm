Is this a Freya Necklace?  Hmm.<br1>
it's okay I guess.<br1>
  It isn'tas interesting as a Blessed Freya Necklace.<br1>
  You could be lucky enoughto get one, or if you happen to aquire Freya's Soul in a bottle you cancreate a Blessed Freya Necklace.<br1>
  However the process is, well.<br1>
different.<br1>
  Tell you what, if you bring me these items I can make onefor you.<br1>
