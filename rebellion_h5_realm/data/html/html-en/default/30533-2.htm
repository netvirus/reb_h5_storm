Our guild specializes in trade between the differentraces.<br1>
We are experts in trade and diplomacy.<br1>
While other races go towar for honor and political gain, our guild sees profit as a path topower.<br1>
Our guild does not trade trivial daily necessities! We only dealwith gold, silver, jewelry,accessories, and precious magic items.<br1>
Ourcustomers are the aristocracy and powerful families from many kingdoms.<br1>
Doing business with them is not only for profit, we also keep watch ontheir affairs.<br1>
We never know when some greedy outsider will get a notionto invade and try to take our property.<br1>
To prevent this, we keep watch,and raise money to train armies or hire soldiers, if necessary, toprotect our wealth and peace.<br1>
