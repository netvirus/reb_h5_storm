<font color="FF8000">Adventurers' Guide Miss Queen:</font><br>
Welcome! I've been dispatched from theAdventurer's Guild to guide characters new to the world of Lineage II.<br1>
In celebration of the arrival of a new era, the guild has temporarilyopened its weapons warehouse to adventurers in training and travelersthat have reached level 6 and completed their first occupation change.<br1>
If you meet these requirements, I'll give you a<font color=LEVEL>weapon exchange coupon</font>and permit you to<font color=LEVEL>rent the weapon of your choice from the	Adventurer's Guild weapons warehouse</font>.<br1>
Bear in mind, this coupon is only valid until you reach level 25.<br1>
