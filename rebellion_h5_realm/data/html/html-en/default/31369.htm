<font color="36DC25"><html><body>	Monk of Silence Mennon:</font><br>
<br> Greetings, my child.<br1>
I'm a monk.<br1>
The Monastery of Silence is	currently conducting a holy ritual which is only held once a decade.<br1>
During this ritual, access to the monastery is restricted to the silent	monks in order to prevent external forces from affecting the ritual.<br1>
You must make a detour.<br1>
