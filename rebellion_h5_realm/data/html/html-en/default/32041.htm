This area is know as the Ruins of Pavel.<br1>
It is one ofthe research labs the Giants established in the distant past.<br1>
I've comehere to research the Starstones that are being produced in this area.<br1>
The roaming golems make it very risky to go outside of the barracks,however.<br1>
In addition, the remnants of ancient old experiments, vile anddisgusting, add to the danger.<br1>
