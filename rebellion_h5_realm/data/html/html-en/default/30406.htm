Ah, to meet a traveler in a place like this! I am Matheo, ascholar of folkish lore, dispatched from the *Ivory Tower.<br1>
* These days Iam researching the history of the Talking Island.<br1>
Do, can you believethat the structure you are looking at now was erected thousands of yearsago? There are several similar relics like this around the island.<br1>
Theywere erected in ancient times by the Elves of light that lived on theTalking Island.<br1>
I think this was where the enchanters of the Elves paidtribute to the island s *Hieros.<br1>
