You feel a chill and hear a voice: A Demon who remainedon the island gathered the most beautiful crystals he could find andcast a spell on them.<br1>
As a result, they are now known as theContaminated Crystals.<br1>
In this place, northwest of here, lie the remains of theDemon is preserved.<br1>
We do not know what is inside, since it was notbuilt by materials native to the island, but I am sure there is aContaminated Crystal hidden somewhere within the *Dark Cloud Mansion*.<br1>
