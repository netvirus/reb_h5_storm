<br> Have you enjoyed your adventure so far? Here is the weapon	exchange coupon for travelers.<br1>
<br>This coupon allows you to receive a grade D weapon from the	warehouse of the Adventurer's Guild.<br1>
The coupon is non-transferable,	and you are responsible for any loss or damage of it or the weapon.<br1>
<br>You may only rent one weapon at a time, and if at any time	before you reach level 25 you become unhappy with your choice, you may	turn in the weapon for another coupon.<br1>
