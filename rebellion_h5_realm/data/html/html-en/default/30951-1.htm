<br> Members of the Platinum tribe resemble wolves.<br1>
They may also	appear somewhat similar to the ol mahums, but they worship the goddess	of light.<br1>
It is their sacred duty to kill any invaders who enter the	Tower of Insolence.<br1>
Their devotion can be quite deadly and they should	be avoided when at all possible.<br1>
<br> They are led by winged creatures known as angels.<br1>
The	Mystics would say that they are "spirits serving the goddess in this	dimension.<br1>
" There are two types of angels: seal angels and guardian	angels.<br1>
