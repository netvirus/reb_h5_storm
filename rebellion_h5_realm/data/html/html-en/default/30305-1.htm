Enlightenment is followed by sacrifice.<br1>
If youlookback on the history of our race, you willtruly relize the truth of thisteaching.<br1>
Whenthe * Great Sorcerer Dasparion* came to us athousand yearsago and proposed to teach usblack magic, we did not anticipate thesacrificewe would have to pay in the future andaccepted his proposal.<br1>
When we were at war the Elves of thelight, the black magic spells wecast wiped outthe innocent Elves of the trees, due toDasparion'smalicous plots.<br1>
While the Elves ofthe trees died, they cursed us withall teirremaining strength.<br1>
As a result, our beautifulforest withered,our skin became scorched bythe sun, we went blind and became therace ofthe Dark.<br1>
For hundreds of years, welived hidden underground.<br1>
Now thecurse of the Dark EDlves has beenbroken and we live above the ground,but wemust not forget the high price we paid to earnstrength.<br1>
