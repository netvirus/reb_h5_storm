If you have powerful companions, they may purchase equipment for you.<br1>
Otherwise, equipment for novices is provided by the Temple of Shilen.<br1>
For now, you should seek to master the arms and armour you alreadypossess.<br1>
You will sometimes obtain arms and armor from the monsters youhunt.<br1>
With some luck, you may acquire *cloth shoes, apprentice's shoes,or a* *cloth cap.<br1>
* The temple will provide you with two differentblades, a * dagger* and a squire's sword.<br1>
The dagger is swift, but itsaccuracy suffers, while the squire's sword (one-handed sword) isnoticeably slower than the dagger, but strikes with greater accuracy.<br1>
Remember that different weapons may call upon different skills in theiruse.<br1>
Return to me when you have achieved *level 6.<br1>
* and I will teach youmore about weapons.<br1>
