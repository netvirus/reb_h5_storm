*The Seed of Infinity* is an infernal region ruled byShilen's disciple, the undead fiend *Ekimus*.<br1>
We know little about him,unfortunately.<br1>
But I can you something about this region itself.<br1>
Here*space itself is organically linked together like some vast livingorganism*.<br1>
Just as your whole body is affected if you injure one part,so the Seed of Infinity's overall power decreases as we slay monsters inthis region.<br1>
But if you are killed within, then your soul will feed andstrengthen the power of the entire Seed.<br1>
That is why it is so importantthat *only parties of skilled adventurers be admitted to the Seed ofInfinity*.<br1>
