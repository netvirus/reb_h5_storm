Hello.<br1>
I am Andellia, guardian of the Mother Tree Glade.<br1>
Whatnice weather! The Mother Tree Glade in our Elven Forest will be in finespirits on such a day as this.<br1>
By the way, did you know that if you goto the Human region of Innadril, there is another village where ourbrother Elves live? You didn't know? Actually, I haven't been theremyself, but .<br1>
those who wanted to settle a new village went out andfounded Innadril, which is far from here.<br1>
They say that they built itjust like our village, out of homesickness, but I'm curious what itlooks like.<br1>
They must have someone who manages the Mother Tree Gladethere, too, don't you think? I would like to meet them someday.<br1>
