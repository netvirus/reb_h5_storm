The Reptilikons were the most familiar to us when wecrashed here because they superficially resemble the Lizardmen clans.<br1>
However, as I said, the resemblence is purely superficial.<br1>
They don'tseem to have any advanced social structure beyond the tendency to travelin herds and devour everything in sight.<br1>
Just about every Reptilikonpossesses a deadly poisonous bite.<br1>
<br>Of the clans of Seed beasts, they seem to be the most prolific.<br1>
In anycase, if you value your life, be careful here.<br1>
