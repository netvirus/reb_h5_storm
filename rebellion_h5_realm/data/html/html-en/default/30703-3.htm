The best place here is the Enchanted Valley!Leave the town by the north-west exit, you will reach there right away.<br1>
The scenery is wonderful and you will find unique things to hunt.<br1>
Eventhough our union has the priority to hunt, we don't stop others fromhunting.<br1>
However, it is quite a rough place to hunt.<br1>
Besides that, theForest of Mirrors is located in the east and the Valley of Dragons tothe south.<br1>
Both places are as rough as the Enchanted Valley.<br1>
If you wantto know more, you should go there.<br1>
