These warm spring sunrays feel strange to me undoubtedly becauseI'm used to the frozen eternal winter of the Ice Palace.<br1>
I fear they maybe causing some equally strange thoughts, as I'm feeling rather generousright now.<br1>
Give me one Adena and I shall bestow a gift upon you forvisiting me.<br1>
However, if you don't intend to bother me, leave me alone awhile, say.<br1>
20 hours, so that I might enjoy this change of weather.<br1>
Ohand also, should you find any heart-warming items during youradventures, bring them back to me and I might feel even more generous.<br1>
