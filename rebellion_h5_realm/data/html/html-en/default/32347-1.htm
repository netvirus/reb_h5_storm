The Ancient Text ot the Demon is an old tome regarded as anunholy scriptures by the Demons of Hellbound.<br1>
It was created through thepower of darkness and contains a mysterious energy, which can be veryuseful -- if you can obtain it, of course.<br1>
You can find the Hidded FirstPage, the Hidden Second Page and the Fragment of a Contact with theDemon by reading this book.<br1>
However, it will turn to dust if you try touse phisical strength on it, so you must be careful.<br1>
If you bring it tome, I can put it to good use -- it will be utterly useless to you, incase you had other ideas.<br1>
But give it to me and I will exchange it foritem of greather value for you.<br1>
