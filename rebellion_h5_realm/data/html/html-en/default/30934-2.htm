<br> My older brother Trumpin is also a collector.<br1>
He is very	diligent and capable, although he does have a weakness for games of	chance.<br1>
I have watched him gamble away all his savings.<br1>
<br> Actually I saw him not too long ago.<br1>
We were running away	from monster eyes and became separated.<br1>
He must still be somewhere in	this crater.<br1>
