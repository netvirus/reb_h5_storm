<font color="0040FF"><html><body>	Collector Trumpin:</font><br>
<br> My sister's name is Marsha.<br1>
She is a collector like myself,	very outgoing and bright.<br1>
Her only flaw is her habit of solving	problems by trickery instead of real work, but you will find her	plain-spoken and easy-to-read.<br1>
<br> Not long ago she and I were running away from monster eyes	and got separated.<br1>
I believe she still must be somewhere in this	crater.<br1>
If you run into her please let her know that I'm looking for	her.<br1>
