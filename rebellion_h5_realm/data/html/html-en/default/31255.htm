Buzz the Cat Meow! Nice to meet you! I'm Puss the Cat, the faithfulservant of Great Magus Ahuron Raulian.<br1>
My master is one of the greatestmagi of the Ivory Tower.<br1>
Recently, while out with his girlfriend, hehelped a *bloody pixy with an injured leg*.<br1>
A few days later he receiveda box full of Pumpkin Seeds! The box was smeared with Red Fairy Dust, soit must have been sent by the grateful bloody pixy.<br1>
*But now thepumpkin grown from the seed is annoying my master, asking for nectar dayand night!* He doesn't want to offend the bloody pixy by just throwingit away, and also seems to think that something good may eventually comefrom it.<br1>
He has asked us, his faithful servants, to give away thePumpkin Seeds to whoever can get the nectar to raise them! We haveorganized a pumpkin growing event to promote his idea! Meow! You can getnectars by killing any monsters near your level all throughout theworld.<br1>
