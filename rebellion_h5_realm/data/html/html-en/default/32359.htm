Please help me! I heard this story from my ancestors, so I dont'tknow all the exact details, but I will tell you what I know.<br1>
Listencarefully! The Isle of Prayer was once a nest of the Water DragonFafurion.<br1>
The dragon was usually friendly, but occasionally it would flyinto a murderous rage -- perhaps because of some kind of spell.<br1>
When inthat state, however, it would destroy its surroundings completely.<br1>
TheElves of Innadril feared for their safety, so they sent a female Elf tobecome Fafurion's priestess.<br1>
It was her task to keep the creature calm.<br1>
This interested the evil Beleth, who manipulated the priestess tocontrol Fafurion, and planted "Seeds of Evil" on monsters around theIsle of Prayer as a means of spyring on the situation.<br1>
A couple of yearsago, I was able to extract a Seed of Evil fragment from a dead monsteron the Isle of Prayer.<br1>
I discovered that it contains a magic bothpowerful and evil -- even the mere fragment I had was astonishing.<br1>
Weare now focusing our efforts on extracting that power to apply to ourother Dwarven technologies.<br1>
As you see, I am too old to fight thesemonsters.<br1>
Will you collect more of these fragments for me? I shall giveyou a precious gift if you do.<br1>
There are 6 types of seeds, with eachcolor representing a different ability.<br1>
You will be able to find theseeds scattered throughout Isle of Prayer.<br1>
