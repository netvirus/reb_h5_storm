The Bistakon, well, the Bistakon are the one clan in thisseed that most resembles the race of man.<br1>
However, they are a twistedreflection of the most bestial motives and intentions within man'sheart.<br1>
They are wont to acts of extreme violence, tearing their preylimb from limb.<br1>
There are even reports that they will devour each otherwhen other forms of prey are unavailable.<br1>
<br>If you are caught in their powerful claws, they will never let go andyou may never stop the bleeding.<br1>
As with the other clans of the Seed, weknow nothing about their origins or whether they evolved from some otherform.<br1>
In any case, you must be extremely careful here.<br1>
