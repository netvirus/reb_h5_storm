If you have a trap, then you may use at least 3 types ofcapture skills.<br1>
You can only use a capture skill on the predatoryTyrannosaurus.<br1>
If you are capturing a Tyrannosaurus for the first time,you will use the<font color=LEVEL>Kabokula</font>technique most among the three capture skills.<br1>
But you cannot completelycapture this powerful predatory dinosaur with just one skill type! Atthis pont, watch the Tyrannosaurus reactions and use the proper skill tomaintain its state of captivity.<br1>
Nothing is a better teacher than yourown experience, but since you have come all this way, I will tell youthe traditional capture method of the Elkrohki.<br1>
Listen carefuly.<br1>
