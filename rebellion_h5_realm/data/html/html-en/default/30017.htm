<font color="FFFF00">Grand Sorcerer Gallint:</font><br>
Welcome. I am Grand Sorcerer Gallint of Einhovant's School of Wizardry.<br1>
This is a school for Mystics, established by the famed alchemist Einhovant.<br1>
I was once an apprentice of his but he vanished soon after establishing this school, and I have not heard from him since.<br1>
I wonder if he still lives...<br>
