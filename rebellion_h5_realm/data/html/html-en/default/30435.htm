<font color="36DC25">Leopold:</font><br>
Nice to meet you, traveler.<br1>
I am Leopold, commander of thethird platoon of the Black Lion mercenaries.<br1>
Our troops are as dignifiedand courageous as any Knights on this continent.<br1>
We, the Black Lions,were the ones who defended the Castle of Giran when the drakes floodedDragon Valley last summer.<br1>
And we were the ones to destroy the Abellanpirates during the attack of Heine, the Floating City.<br1>
Currently, wehave been hired by the lord of Gludio to drive away the remaining troopsof Gracia.<br1>
We must not mistake them for frightened fugitive soldiers.<br1>
Weare dealing with an infamous *foreign troop ol mahum*, that is known fortheir cruelty and plundering.<br1>
