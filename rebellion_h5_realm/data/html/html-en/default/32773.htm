<font color="0040FF">Officer Jakan:</font><br>
The day that our fleet all went down in the Seed ofAnnihilation.<br1>
I could hear the screams of my subordinates as theydisappeared, but I had to leave them all behind and escape from thatplace with Ermian.<br1>
Still, even as a soldier, I don't regret my decision.<br1>
But I can't help but feel regret about the deaths of my subordinates.<br1>
Ican still hear their cries.<br1>
I was completely helpless as my subordinatesperished.<br1>
This is really sad.<br1>
It was all my fault.<br1>
Are you alsoheaded for the Seed of Annihilation? Then listen well.<br1>
I will tell youhow to survive in that hellish place.<br1>
