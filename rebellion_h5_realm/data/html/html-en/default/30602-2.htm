It's never too early to think about your long-term goals.<br1>
The Kingdomof Aden is in chaos, because they are at war with Elmore to the northand Gracia across the sea.<br1>
Remember, *there are alwyas opportunities**during times of chaos* .<br1>
You're just a novice grunt now, but it's yourduty to become a great hero and restore the Orc race to supremacy.<br1>
Youmust begin by familiarizing yourself with the gear you already have.<br1>
Whether you seek to become a dragon slayer or the commander of a greathorde of Orcs, it all begins with your training here.<br1>
Start out byhunting crimson keltirs or kasha wolves around the village.<br1>
When youfind items left behind by the monsters you slay, try equipping thearmour and weapons, to see if they're better than what you already have.<br1>
If you have no other use for them, you can always sell them at a shop.<br1>
