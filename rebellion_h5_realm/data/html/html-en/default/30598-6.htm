Several of the villagers here could use you help.<br1>
Talk to them andclick on Quest to see what missions they have to offer.<br1>
Of course, evenif they're looking for help tey're not going to offer you a missionthat's beyond your capablities.<br1>
If they refuse to offer you anything, itmeans you need to get more experience first.<br1>
Nobody wants you to getinto trouble you can't get out of.<br1>
And remember -- some quests can onlybe compleated once, but others can be done several times.<br1>
