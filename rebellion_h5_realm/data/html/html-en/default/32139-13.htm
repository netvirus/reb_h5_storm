To become a Dragoon, you must gain the approval ofsomeone with authority.<br1>
I believe Master Gwain currently has that role.<br1>
You may be able to find him in the Town of Gludio.<br1>
Return here with arecommendation letter from him and the requisite skills, and you willbecome a Dragoon.<br1>
