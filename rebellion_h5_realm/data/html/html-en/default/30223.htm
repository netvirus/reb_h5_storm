Sometimes I wonder if we've forgotten the truly importantthings in life.<br1>
I once was a student studying magic.<br1>
There was a timewhen I spent all my energy on research and discipline--hungry to put myhands on the greatest magical powers.<br1>
But at this instant, as I feel thecool wind blowing through the trees and picture *the woman I love*, Icannot help but just smile.<br1>
This small, but strong happiness has becomethe most precious thing in my life.<br1>
