It was the evil Death Lord Hallate.<br1>
He who leads thearmy of darkness.<br1>
He who is known as the insolent invader or thearchenemy of the angels.<br1>
He made me an offer that I couldn't refuse.<br1>
Hepromised me that he would help me to create a masterpiece that would godown in history.<br1>
Ignoring the entreaties of my darling wife I went alongwith it.<br1>
and fell into the demon's trap.<br1>
This led to his taking ofmy beloved wife Reiria.<br1>
