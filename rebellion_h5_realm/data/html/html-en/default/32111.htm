<br> Welcome! My name is Orahochin, I am a proud warrior of the	tribe Elroki! My mission is to guard this place.<br1>
In fact, I guard the	hope and the future of the tribe.<br1>
Do you understand? Ah, my young	friend, I hope your boots faster than your brain! Ha ha!	<br> Do you see the island over there? There you will find the	village of innocent and peaceful Elroki.<br1>
I can assure you that they are	very different from degraded Elrokhians.<br1>
<br> I send to the island only those who don't hurt them.<br1>
Ah .<br1>
You don't seem dangerous.<br1>
If you want, I'll send you to the island.<br1>
<br>	<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Quest 6111_ElrokiTeleporters">Go		to the island.<br1>
