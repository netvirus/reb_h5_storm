I suppose you're wondering how I manage to stay alive in thishabitat.<br1>
Well, I just smear their dead flesh all over my body, from headto toe.<br1>
Especially those hard to reach spots.<br1>
The smell is the worstpart.<br1>
But you get used to it after a while.<br1>
Do you see Torumba overthere? He's the chief of the Reptilikon species.<br1>
They call him TheOmnivore because he once ate one of his own messengers just forreporting news he didn't like.<br1>
If you're thinking about taking onTorumba, your best bet is to change yourself into one of his own kind.<br1>
Ibelieve a Treykan would work best.<br1>
I can perform the ritual - however,it requires a great amount of energy.<br1>
