<br> Welcome to the rift between the dimensions of time and space!	Where you're standing now is relatively safe.<br1>
It was created using all	available resources.<br1>
By the way, I see that inner space where you're	looking, and I must warn you.<br1>
We can't guarantee your safety! Don't	try to go there without our help!	<br> Don't forget! You'll have a better chance of returning alive	if you take some friends with you.<br1>
