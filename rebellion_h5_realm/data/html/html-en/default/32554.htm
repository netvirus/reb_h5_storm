Hmm.<br1>
What business do you have here? If you're askingabout the current status, I haven't seen any sign of the enemy aroundhere.<br1>
I just don't know how much longer we have to stand guard.<br1>
I signedon to fight the enemy, not to play sentry while those adventurers fromAden get all the glory.<br1>
Bah! Forget what I said.<br1>
I don't want to picka fight with you.<br1>
We're all thankful for your help.<br1>
Because of yourarrival, some of our soldiers can finally get some much-needed R-and-R.<br1>
