What brings you to this desolate snowfield, youngtraveler? I am Rosheek, who trains Kabart, the traditional martial artof the Orcs.<br1>
As the god Paagrio has taught us, we must continuously makean effort to strengthen ourselves above all the other creatures thatlive.<br1>
I have stayed in this place for the past month, fasting andmeditating, to discipline myself in order to reach a higher level ofstrength.<br1>
When my mind concentrates to fight the severe cold and hunger,I can feel the heat of the combative spirit that burns like a flamewithin me.<br1>
