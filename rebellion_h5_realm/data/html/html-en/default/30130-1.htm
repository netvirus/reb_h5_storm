The Temple of Shilen is a cultural treasure,with a history of more than 2,000 years.<br1>
In the days when our race livedunderground, the Harnea of the Arachne race spun silver spider webs andprotected the temple by spinning a curtain around it.<br1>
Here, all youngDark Elves undergo rites to receive Shilen's blessing before beginningtheir new lives as Dark Fighters or Dark Mystics.<br1>
