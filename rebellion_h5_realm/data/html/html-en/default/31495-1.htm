<br> Did you know that these catacombs and necropolises were	originally sealed in another dimension by the seal of Shunaiman, along	with the magic that obscured the chasm that Lilith created to entice	Shilen?	<br> When the seal was broken, these structures appeared in this	dimension! As a result, the power that was the seal exploded, and its	fragments were scattered throughout the area.<br1>
Part of that power	collided with the wall of dimension and created a tiny crack in it.<br1>
Through this crevice, a pathway formed between purgatory and this	world! This is what we call a dimension gap!	<br> Time and space are practically unrecognizable there, so it's	wise not to stay in any one place too long! One must have a	<font color="LEVEL"> dimension fragment</font> in order to enter there.<br1>
This fragment was created from the force released when the seal was	shattered.<br1>
