A mysterious five-colored whirlwind swirls within anaquamarine sphere, and you hear a clear, cultured voice.<br1>
Welcome.<br1>
I amthe first child of the Oracle.<br1>
My mistress ia *Parme*, the Shamaness ofthe Water Dragon.<br1>
She is currently under the enemy's control, but anOracle led me to this place just before she was captured.<br1>
