Hi! Welcome to the Beast Farm.<br1>
My name is Tunatunand I'm the one in charge here.<br1>
I got this job because I thought I'd beable to commune with the beasts.<br1>
After all, my pet kitty back homeabsolutely loved me.<br1>
On this farm though, it's not so easy.<br1>
As a matterof fact, I'm having a lot of trouble with these beasts.<br1>
They tend tofight back if you try to feed or tame them, so I've hired a Feed Sellerand various adventurers to help me manage and protect the farm.<br1>
At thispoint, there's not much else I can do.<br1>
