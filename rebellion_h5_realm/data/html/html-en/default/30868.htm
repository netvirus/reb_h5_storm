Welcome to Aden Castle Town.<br1>
I am Eric Rodemai, oneof the court guards.<br1>
Oren is the center of military affairs and Giran isthe center of commerce& And here, Aden is considered the center ofpolitics, culture and religion.<br1>
Hearing this, you may think that theplace has the bustling atmosphere of a metropolitan area.<br1>
But due to itsproximity to the border with Elmore, it always tends to maintain asomewhat tense atmosphere.<br1>
The two types of atmosphere are alwaysco-mingling creating a unique balance.<br1>
