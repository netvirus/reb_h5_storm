I have given your leader the reward as promised.<br1>
I willalso give you the<font color="LEVEL">Proof of Keucereus - Stage 1</font>, which is evidence of a successful attack mission within the Hall ofSuffering.<br1>
You must have this proof to undertake additional attackmissions.<br1>
Keep it safe! We do not normally give it out more than once.<br1>
Our business is now complete.<br1>
You may rest here or leave using theScroll of Escape that I gave you.<br1>
<br>I hope that you will continue to challenge yourself -- it is the onlypath to growth.<br1>
