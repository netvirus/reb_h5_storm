Shilen, Mother of the Abyss, is the Goddesswhocontrols fate and death.<br1>
Shilen permits alllife to be limited, and it isshe who enablesdeath, so that all livingthing can return totheiroriginal state of nothingness.<br1>
Other racesdo not understand the eternalcycle of birthand death.<br1>
They only see one side of death,and fear andhate Shilen.<br1>
Beacuse of these prejudices, in the HumanKingdom, the markof Shilen hanging aroundone's neck will lead to being burnt at thestakefor heresy.<br1>
In spite of this persecution, thereare secret groups ofHumans who follow theGoddess Shilen.<br1>
In a sense, their faith is thesameas the Dark Elves.<br1>
If only we could knowwho they were.<br1>
