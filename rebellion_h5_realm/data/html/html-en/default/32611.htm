I am Officer Tolonis, and I'm in charge of deliveringsupplies like Energy Stones to adventurers.<br1>
I used to be a platoonleader, but after I was injured they gave me this posting.<br1>
I'm proud ofwhat I do here, but I miss the life of battle.<br1>
Oh well, I supposesomebody has to manage supplies.<br1>
If you're interested in acquiring thecollection skill, perhaps I can help.<br1>
