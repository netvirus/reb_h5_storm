My family ran a vineyard in Gludio for generations.<br1>
But twoyears ago, during the war with Gracia, it was all burned down by theplundering convict troops.<br1>
My brother and cousins who tried to save thefarm all died terrible deaths.<br1>
Ahh, it is a painful past that I do notwant to recall.<br1>
Please ask no more.<br1>
