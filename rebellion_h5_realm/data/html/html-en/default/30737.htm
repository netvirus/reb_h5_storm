<font color="0040FF">Guild Member Morgan:</font><br>
I am Morgan of the Aden Commercial Guild.<br1>
If I amto speak of our commercial guild, I would say that it is a guild set upto unify the traders throughout the kingdom in order to restrain theDwarven traders that are spreading their powers by the day.<br1>
Protectingthe rights and privileges of the upright traders that do businesshonestly in order to live from the high-handedness of the Dwarven Guildis the reason that we set up our guild.<br1>
Of course, another purpose is toget more benefit through the interaction and connections between thetraders.<br1>
But to tell you the truth, from the perspective of results,trading ability is always found in good Dwarves.<br1>
