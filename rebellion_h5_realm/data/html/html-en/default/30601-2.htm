Think about the long term, and that will show you the beginning, TheKingdom of Aden is in chaos, because of the war with Elmore to the northand Gracia across the sea, But hark ye now, *there are alwaysopportunities in times of* *chaos,* We Dwarves are merchants, and thatmeans we're opportunists by nature, If you want to become rich and leaveyour mark on the world,then heed my advice.<br1>
For now, your task is tomaster the arms and armor you've been given, Whether you survive tobecome a Bounty Hunter, collecting scales from dragons, or take the pathof a Warsmith, with massive siege engines at your command, it all startswith the basics I can tell you here and now.<br1>
So practice your huntingskills on *longtail* *keltirs* , or gremlin scavengers around thevillage.<br1>
When you find items left behind by your prey, try equipping theweapons and armour to see if they're better than what your've alreadygot.<br1>
As for the rest, if you have no use for it you can always sell itat the shops for pocket money.<br1>
