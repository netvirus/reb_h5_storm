As you know, four tetrarchs rule the Dark Elves.<br1>
In the name ofour patriarch, who was sealed away by Humans, they have triumphantly ledour race for the past 400 years.<br1>
At times they have competed over power,but in times of crisis, all followed the will of Tetrarch Thifiell.<br1>
Thetetrarchs assign young Dark Elves various tasks to train them.<br1>
If youare interested, I suggest you meet one.<br1>
I am curious what trial you willreceive.<br1>
