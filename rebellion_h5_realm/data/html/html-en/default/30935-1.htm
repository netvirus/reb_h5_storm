<br> Working under the shadow of the Ivory Tower, I often admire	its graceful beauty.<br1>
It reminds me of a delicate porcelain vase, that	but with the slightest bit of mishandling would shatter into millions	of pieces.<br1>
<br> It doesn't seem structurally sound, does it? Any Dwarf with a	basic knowledge of design would see this.<br1>
It is no doubt held together	by the force of the magic conducted within its walls.<br1>
If one day those	wizards were to lose their power.<br1>
this beautiful building would be	reduced to a pile of pebbles.<br1>
