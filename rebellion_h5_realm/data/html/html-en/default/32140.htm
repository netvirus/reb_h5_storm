I am Vice Hierarch Zenya.<br1>
I assist the Hierarchand watch over you, our young Kamael warriors, who are leaving thesafety of our little nest.<br1>
Now that the seal on the Kamael has beenbroken and other races come in and out of the village as they please, Iam concerned that the Kamael who leave this place will forget ourancient traditions and customs.<br1>
Certainly they are very different fromthose of the outside world.<br1>
Do not forget! Cling tightly to theskills, the culture and the spirit of the Kamael.<br1>
