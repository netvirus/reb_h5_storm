Have you ever seen the face of a dead man? Just as people'sexpressions are different, the bloodless, pale face also has differentfacial and eye expressions.<br1>
Some have surprised or sad faces, and othersmeet death with a peaceful expression.<br1>
Are you thinking that ourconversation is disagreeable? Everyone is bound to die.<br1>
Why is it youavoid talking about death? Well, I suppose I must be used to it sinceI've seen dead people frequently since I was a child.<br1>
Our family hasbeen doing *this work* for generations.<br1>
However, there are hardly anypeople who look for undertakers these days.<br1>
It is because the Priests ofEinhasad encourage cremation.<br1>
Very few people put the corpses in acoffin and bury them in the ground.<br1>
But once in a while, there are somepeople that seek us to follow the old traditions.<br1>
