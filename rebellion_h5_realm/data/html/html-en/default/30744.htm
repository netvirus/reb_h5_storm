<font color="FF8000">Hunter Guild Member Grey:</font><br>
It would be wrong to think of the HunterGuild as a group where members take bows and chase after rabbits anddeer.<br1>
Our guild is made up of those that hunt for the highest levelrewards, assassins of evil beings and explorers of ruins.<br1>
The guildmembers are specialists in searching, tracking and hunting and theynever fail to achieve what they set their sights on.<br1>
They are allexperienced hunters.<br1>
Of course, depending on the situation, they havethe fighting ability to be able to cut short the lives of their targets.<br1>
Ah, I was so busy introducing the guild that I forgot to greet you.<br1>
I amHunter Guild Member Grey.<br1>
