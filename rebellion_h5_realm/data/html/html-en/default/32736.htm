<font color="36DC25">General Ermian:</font><br>
We deployed on an exploration mission, one ship amongmany.<br1>
In an unknown region we encountered something that, to this day, Ican't describe.<br1>
A large.<br1>
.<br1>
mass.<br1>
.<br1>
that shifted colors and shape.<br1>
Assoon as we came into contact with it our ships were pulled into somekind of powerful vortex.<br1>
It swallowed ship and soldier alike.<br1>
I stillhear their screams sometimes.<br1>
No one knew what it was, but I knew whatmy gut said.<br1>
My gut said to get the hell away from it, far away.<br1>
It maybe the only reason any of us lived.<br1>
<br>We don't know where we are or if there are any other survivors.<br1>
So wehave setup camp here in hopes of finding our men.<br1>
But with every minutewe wait, our chances of returning home diminish.<br1>
