<font color="FF8000">Gatekeeper of the Abyss:</font><br>
You sense an icy cold gaze fixed on you from agigantic structure that seems somehow not quite alive nor dead.<br1>
You mustpass its judgment to enter the *heart of the Seed of Infinity*; if youwish to avoid it, you will be expelled *outside the Seed of Infinity*.<br1>
However, the gaze isn't as painful as you feared.<br1>
