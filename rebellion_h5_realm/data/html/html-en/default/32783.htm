<font color="36DC25">Priest of Blessing:</font><br>
The Einhasad Temple is currently accepting donationsfor the needy and helpless.<br1>
Those who donate will receive a small tokenof appreciation, allowing them to remain blessed by Nevit.<br1>
Remember,true love is shown in giving, not receiving! Your soul is as beautifulas your appearance.<br1>
We have also prepared Nevit's Voice in a form calledNevit's Hourglass, which will last a fair while.<br1>
I'd give them all toyou but we have to share them amongst all who donate to the temple.<br1>
Letme know how much Adena you wish to donate.<br1>
And may the blessing of thegods be with you always.<br1>
Remember, choose carefully because you won't beable to donate again for 20 hours.<br1>
