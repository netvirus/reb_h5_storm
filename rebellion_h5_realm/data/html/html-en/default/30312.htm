Have you ever thought that the sea isalive? If you look down at the sea from this lighthouse, you'll get toknow what tales the sea has to tell.<br1>
It shows you a far different facewhen it's clear out than when there's a hurricane.<br1>
Usually, it's calmand quiet, but there's nothin' as scary as the angry sea.<br1>
I became alighthouse keeper because I love the sea.<br1>
My wife and daughter complainthat we suffer in such a small and uncultured island village, but .<br1>
the sea is the heart's refuge, and like a mother's warm love .<br1>
