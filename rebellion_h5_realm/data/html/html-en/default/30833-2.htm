Do you mean Icarus? All the students, including me,feared him.<br1>
Perhaps it's because he's an undead or something but heneither eats nor sleeps.<br1>
But the magic that he holds -- in particular,his knowledge about necromancy -- is clearly the greatest in the land.<br1>
He appears to be going around freely but it is said that he is actuallybeing invisibly constrained by Master Hardin.<br1>
Therefore, he stillteaches various things to us in a friendly way.<br1>
But, well, this isjust my feeling about the matter.<br1>
Even if he wasn't restrained, I amsure he would continue to teach us for the time being.<br1>
It's not that he,who is an undead, feels the any particular love.<br1>
It's for anotherreason.<br1>
