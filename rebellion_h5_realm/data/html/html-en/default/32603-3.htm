This entire area acts almost like a living organism.<br1>
Just as blood supplies nutrients to a human body, so apparently do thesouls who have perished here supply energy for the *Tumors of Death andthe Soul Coffins*.<br1>
They in turn use that energy to strengthen nearbymonsters or disadvantage attacking adventurers.<br1>
Destroy those thingswhenever you encounter them.<br1>
Of course, that's easier said than done --the nearby monsters will defend it fiercely.<br1>
But if you're able todestroy a Tumor, you will gain an advantage over the monsters.<br1>
We don'tknow for sure, but we think that the newly-freed souls help us.<br1>
It ispossible to communicate with a *Destroyed Tumor*, and you can also useit to teleport to other Tumors, although you'll need something called*Tears of a Freed Soul* to do so.<br1>
