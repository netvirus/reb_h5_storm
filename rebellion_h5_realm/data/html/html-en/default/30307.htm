The craftsmen of the Elves of light are skilledindeed, but they are proud -- they look down on any metals other thanmithril, and hate to even touch them.<br1>
Of course, mithril is a finematerial, no doubt.<br1>
It is harder than iron, very lightweight, and isfriendly to magic.<br1>
However, I am not bound by tradition, and I study howto process various materials other than mithril.<br1>
I have already learnedhow to handle adamantite and damascus, and have recently been studyingoriharukon.<br1>
