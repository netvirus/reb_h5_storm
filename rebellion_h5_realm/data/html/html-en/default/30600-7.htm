There are many here in the village who could benefit from yourservices.<br1>
Speak to them to find those who wish to offer employment.<br1>
Theywill offer you an assignment when you click on *Quest.<br1>
* They will notask you to perform a quest which is beyond your abilities, so if theyrefuse to offer a task, it means that your level is too low to provide areasonable chance of success.<br1>
You should also know that there are queststhat you may only perform once, but there are also repeating quests thatyou may complete several times.<br1>
