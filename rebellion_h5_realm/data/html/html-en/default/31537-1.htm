You? You don't look that strong.<br1>
Raising beastsis not an easy thing.<br1>
It could be really dangerious if something goeswrong.<br1>
It's OK when they are young, but it becomes too dangerous for youto handle when they're are fully grown up.<br1>
Maybe it would be better foryou to come back again when you become a little more stronger.<br1>
Then, Iwill gladly give you this Beast Handler's Whip.<br1>
