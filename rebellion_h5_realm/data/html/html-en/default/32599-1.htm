<font color="FF8000">Master Yogi:</font><br>
Are you ready to test your luck? If Fortune holds you inher embrace, then you could win a prize beyond your wildestexpectations.<br1>
And just remember, *you can only have one staff at atime*.<br1>
First, you must purchase a *Staff of Master Yogi*.<br1>
This item willcost a partly 1,000 adena, and will serve as the item to be enchanted.<br1>
Second, you must obtain *special enchant scrolls*.<br1>
There are severalways this can be done.<br1>
Every 6 hours I will sell you a package of 24scrolls for only 6,000 adena.<br1>
You can also obtain scrolls through normalhunting.<br1>
Or you can buy additional scrolls from me for a slightlygreater cost.<br1>
Different rewards are given depending on the number ofsuccessful enchants applied to the weapon.<br1>
And just like with normalenchanting, if you fail you will lose the staff.<br1>
However unlike regularenchanting, enchantment failure will not result in crystals.<br1>
