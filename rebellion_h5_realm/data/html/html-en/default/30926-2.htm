The Lady of the Lake is Eva, the mother of allElves.<br1>
Even before the Elven migration, the people of Innadril knew thegoddess of water well.<br1>
There was a time when Elves regarded Eva asunapproachable and sacred, and this is still true in most parts of theElven Forest.<br1>
But due to the influence of the indigenous religion ofthis area, Eva is a much more accessible and personal goddess to us.<br1>
