I have no information about the origins of this species, but whatI have found is that these creatures do possess a unique energy, sort ofplasma if you will.<br1>
 Hmm…<font color=LEVEL>Maguen Plasma</font>.<br1>
I like that.<br1>
 I think that is what I’ll call it.<br1>
Anyway, when a Maguenappears it begins to bring forth one of these plasmas.<br1>
It will alsocycle through its various plasmas before hiding.<br1>
With Blacksmith Kusto’stalent and my magic we were able to create a device that could harvestthese plasmas… a<font color=LEVEL>Maguen Plasma Collector</font>.<br1>
I know it isn’t too creative but we decided to keep the name simple toavoid explaining what it does.<br1>
  Ugh… fine.<br1>
I’ll explain it to you.<br1>
Whenyou are in the Seed and a Maguen appears you have a very limited time tocollect the Maguen Plasma.<br1>
If you don’t collect the plasma in time theMaguen will go back into hiding.<br1>
I’ve set up a practice Maguen if youwant to try using the Maguen Plasma Collector.<br1>
This isn’t a real Maguen,so you won’t collect any Plasma… just thought you should know so youdon’t get your hopes up.<br1>
