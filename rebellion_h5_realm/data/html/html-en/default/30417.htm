<font color="FF8000">Sir Klaus Vasper:</font><br>
Greetings.<br1>
I am Karol Vasper, first son of the Vasperfamily that has protected the province of Gludio for five generations,and member of the glorious Continental Knights League, knighted by KingCadmus as the Guardian Knight of the west.<br1>
The romance of chivalry sungby wandering minstrels is forgotten in these ages and we Knights arescorned as relics of the old age.<br1>
However, we are successors of a greatlegacy that has continued for over one thousand years since the age ofempires, and we endure the rebukes and scorns of the worldly people anddo not lose our pride for a moment as we silently stand our righteouswar.<br1>
