Are you talking about this cave which is used as the academy?It's not inconvenient for the use of my pupils and me.<br1>
Are you thinkingit's a little rustic? It would be better for you to go ask Sir Lich KingIcarus for more details.<br1>
That's because he was the original owner here.<br1>
I'm the second or third.<br1>
I met him while wandering around after havingleft the side of my master.<br1>
and I took possession of this cave afterwinning a competition.<br1>
Until then, he used this cave as his base but itseems that he was doing a lot of bad things.<br1>
Well, he's not reallysomeone that can boast about any particular accomplishments and so Ican't really tell you too much about what bad actions he committed.<br1>
Ha,ha.<br1>
