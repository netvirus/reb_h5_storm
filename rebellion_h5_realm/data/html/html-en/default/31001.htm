I will tell you a story, one of ancient immorality.<br1>
Once there lived a beautiful princess, in a far away land.<br1>
Her beautywas so renowned that her mother, the Queen, grew jealous and plotted tohave her killed.<br1>
When the King discovered her evil plot he tried to stopit.<br1>
This enraged the wicked Queen further, so much so that she sent akiller for the King as well.<br1>
Needless to say, the country fell into astate of anarchy and civil war.<br1>
The love the princess felt for hermother slowly turned to sadness, and the sadness to hatred.<br1>
This hatredgrew until all she could hold in her hear was the desire to see hermother dead.<br1>
She placed whatever lov, sadness and sympathy that was leftin her heart in a small jeweled box and gave it to a nobleman.<br1>
Unfortunately.<br1>
that is all I know of this story.<br1>
