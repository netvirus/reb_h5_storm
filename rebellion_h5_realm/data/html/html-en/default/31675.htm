This place has been the boundary between the two kingdoms for hundredsof years.<br1>
I trust that you will behave yourself among the foreigners anddo nothing to bring discredit, dishonor or even embarrassment upon AdenKingdom.<br1>
Should you meet Yeus" on the other side, I'd be obliged if youwould give him greetings from me.<br1>
I know that would make him veryhappy.<br1>
