<br> There are rules to the	<font color="LEVEL"> Rift of Dimension</font>.<br1>
Where you go and what	goes on inside there remains a mystery.<br1>
Once you get inside using the	fragment, you'll only be able to stay for	<font color="LEVEL"> about 40 minutes</font> before	<font color="LEVEL"> the dimension shifts</font>.<br1>
Don't forget that.<br1>
<br> If you don't like where you entered, you can	<font color="LEVEL"> move just once</font>.<br1>
<br> This decision must be made by	<font color="LEVEL"> the party leader</font>.<br1>
<br> You may not leave the party or allow anyone else to join your	party while there, it's too dangerous.<br1>
