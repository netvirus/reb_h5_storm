Begin by hunting *red keltirs* or *wolves* near thevillage but the wolves are the more dangerous.<br1>
Around level 6 you shouldbe able to challenge the *Kaboo Orcs* that lurk beyond the southwesternedge of the village, or the past the southeastern gate.<br1>
Remember,though, that orcs are more dangerous than they seem, for if you attackone several others may come to its aid.<br1>
When you target a monster, themoster's name appears in the upper central portion of the screen.<br1>
*Thecolour of the name tells you the monster's difficulty* .<br1>
For now, huntthose that appear in white or sky blue.<br1>
Those that appear in red oryellow are much stronger than you, so leave them alone.<br1>
finally, for nowhunt near the *shadow of the Mother Tree* .<br1>
Your strength will recoverquickly when you stand beneath the Mother's nurturing branches.<br1>
