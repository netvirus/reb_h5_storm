You can use an Airship to take you to differentlocations in Gracia.<br1>
Board one in the wharf behind us by using theAirship Controller.<br1>
If there is no Airship currently docked there,you'll just have to wait.<br1>
Unless, of course, you're one of those Adenadventurers who can transform into a flying creature.<br1>
