Gracia is in a very precarious situation.<br1>
After my father,King Paris, passed away, Gracia was engulfed in civil war.<br1>
It finallyended, but the peace that followed was hardly complete.<br1>
It was.<br1>
abreathing space to llow the two sides to regain their strength.<br1>
Beforethat happened, however, the Priests of Darkness appeared.<br1>
We thoughtthey were only legends from the ancient books.<br1>
Even the worshippers ofShilen didn't think they really existed.<br1>
If my father did know aboutthem, then he obviously didn't consider them much of a threat.<br1>
But thetime we realized they were, it was too late.<br1>
Seeds spawned from theworld of Death sprouted throughout Gracia, spawning dangerous monsters.<br1>
Except for those I saved, I doubt anyone survived the assault.<br1>
Apartfrom those blasted pagans, of course.<br1>
