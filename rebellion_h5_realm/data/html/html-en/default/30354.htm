Hundreds of years have passed since our race has been set freefrom the curse of the tree Elves.<br1>
However, I still remember the pain ofmy flesh burning in the light of the sun.<br1>
For unnumbered years we wereforced to live in the darkness underground, and come to the surface onlyat night.<br1>
Thanks to the studies of the tetrarchs, the curse that forcedus into darkness has been broken, and we have retaken the forest thatused to be our home.<br1>
But we still live in this underground city, and ourfriendship with the night to bring war and vengeance to the Elves of thelight and the Humans that persecuted us.<br1>
The brothers of light thatexpelled us and the Humans that mocked us with wicked deception will notbe forgiven.<br1>
But it is true that there are times when I remember all ofour people dancing together under the moonlight and enjoying poetry andmusic by the river a very long time ago.<br1>
Perhaps we have forgotten howto enjoy life because of hatred and revenge.<br1>
