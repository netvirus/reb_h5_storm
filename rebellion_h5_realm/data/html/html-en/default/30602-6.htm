Several of the villagers here could use your help.<br1>
Talk to them andclick on *Quest* to see what missions they have to offer.<br1>
Of course,even if they're looking for help they're not going to offer you amission that's beyond your capabilities.<br1>
If they refuse to offer youanything, it means you need to get some more experience first.<br1>
Nobodywants you to get into trouble you can't get out of.<br1>
And remember - somequests can only be completed once, but others can be completed severaltimes.<br1>
