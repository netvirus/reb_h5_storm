Right now, you should leave the village by south gate and hunt*longtail keltirs* , gremlin scavengers or wolves, Wolves are the mostdangerous, so take care, If there are too many hunters on that side ofthe village, look to the eastside of the bank after you exit the villagefrom the north gate.<br1>
Remember, when you target a monster, its name willappear at the top-center of the screen.<br1>
The color of the name shows howdifficult it is.<br1>
For now, stick to creatures with white or sky-bluenames, The ones in red and and yellow are much stronger than you, sosteer clear.<br1>
And be ye warned,you're not ready to go messing withgoblins yet, They're agood deal smarter and stronger than they seem.<br1>
Most importantly, they understand teamwork -- if one goblin is introuble, others will come to its aid.<br1>
So even if you're strong enough totake a goblin one-on-one, you're nowhere near ready to deal with two orthree, Watch yourself now.<br1>
