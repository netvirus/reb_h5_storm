For now, you should hunt *keltirs* , elder keltirs, or wolves near thevillage.<br1>
Wolves are the most dangerous, so take care.<br1>
When you target amonster, the monster's name appears in the upper central portion of thescreen.<br1>
*The colour of the name tells you the* *monster's difficulty* .<br1>
For now, hunt those that appear in white or sky blue.<br1>
those that appearin red or yello are much stronger than you, so leave them alone.<br1>
Finally, a warning -- you are not yet powerful enough to engage orcs.<br1>
They are both stonger and more clever than they seem.<br1>
Worst of all, theyunderstand teamwork, and if you engage one orc others will come to helpit against you.<br1>
Even if you have a chance against a single orc, two ormore will surely slay you.<br1>
