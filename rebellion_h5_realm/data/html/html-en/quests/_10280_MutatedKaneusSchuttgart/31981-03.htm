<br> Excellent! Visit the Kamaloka we can enter from Schuttgart,	kill the Kaneus there and extract their cellular tissues.<br1>
<br> You will face the	<font color="LEVEL">Venomous Storace</font> and	<font color="LEVEL">Kel Bilette</font> Kaneus.<br1>
<br> When you have extracted all the cellular tissues of the	Kaneus, take them to	<font color="LEVEL">Magister Atraxia</font> at the Temple of Einhasad.<br1>
I know he and the other Sages will appreciate your efforts.<br1>
