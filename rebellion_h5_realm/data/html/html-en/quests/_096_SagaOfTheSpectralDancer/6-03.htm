Tablet of Vision:<br>
Suddenly, a vast amount of knowledge is painfully seared into your brain. The cascade of brief images is unintelligible ay sirst... As the pain slowly ebbs, you feel dizzy and begin ty sisualize a new place. It seems as though it might be in the southeasy sf Ketra Orc Outpost. Around a tablet I can see Hallate's Dancer Lilliay ss Mordred warned. I can also sense the power of the Stone of Communy sminating from her. As I try to look deeper, my vision slowly comes bacy so normal. The tablet goes still and dark, as if nothing had happened.<br>
I know now that I must find the Tablet of Vision in* the Southeast of Ketra Orc Outpost*!
