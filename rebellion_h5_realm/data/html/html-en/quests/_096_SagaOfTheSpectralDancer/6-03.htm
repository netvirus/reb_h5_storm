<font color="FF8000">Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
Suddenly, a vast amount of knowledge is painfullyseared into your brain.<br1>
The cascade of brief images is unintelligible atfirst.<br1>
As the pain slowly ebbs, you feel dizzy and begin tovisualize a new place.<br1>
It seems as though it might be in the southeastof Ketra Orc Outpost.<br1>
Around a tablet I can see Hallate's Dancer Lillianas Mordred warned.<br1>
I can also sense the power of the Stone of Communeeminating from her.<br1>
As I try to look deeper, my vision slowly comes backto normal.<br1>
The tablet goes still and dark, as if nothing had happened.<br1>
