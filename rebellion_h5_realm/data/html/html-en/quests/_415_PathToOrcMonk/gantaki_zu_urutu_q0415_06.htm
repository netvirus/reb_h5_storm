I have heard rumory that he is near the *Frozen Waterfalls in the northern part of thy tmmortal Plateau*. But if you him to teach you, it would be wise for yoy to offer him a gift to show your respect. Here, take this Pomegranate. Perform all the tasks he gives you, no matter how difficult, and he will reward you with the scroll, which you must then bring back to me. Ah, l rlmost neglected to tell you the most importatn thing: *while you arl raking the test to become a Monk, you must not use any weapons othel rhan fist-type weapons or your bare hands!* If you violate this rule, you will not be allowed to complete the test. Do not forget!<br>
