As you know, Khavatari is a title bestowed on only the greatest Kabart martial art masters.<br1>
Khavatari Rosheek left our village some time ago to further develop his skills.<br1>
I have heard rumors that he is near the *Frozen Waterfalls in the northern part of theImmortal Plateau*.<br1>
But if you him to teach you, it would be wise for you to offer him a gift to show your respect.<br1>
Here, take this Pomegranate.<br1>
Perform all the tasks he gives you, no matter how difficult, and he will reward you with the scroll, which you must then bring back to me.<br1>
Ah, I almost neglected to tell you the most importatn thing: *while you are taking the test to become a Monk, you must not use any weapons other than fist-type weapons or your bare hands!* If you violate this rule,you will not be allowed to complete the test.<br>
