Very good! I haven't seen one with your guts in along time.<br1>
Actually, I have nothing to teach you that you have not already taught yourself.<br1>
The flame stands for strong faith that wishes to become stronger and a fiery desire to achieve victory.<br1>
I was testing whether you had the heart to abandon all desires and walk the path of the Paagrio Monk who pursues only strength.<br1>
This is the meaning of theTrial of Flame.<br1>
Now take this! The fiery spirit scroll! Take it and this letter and go back to *Gantaki Zu Urutu*.<br>
