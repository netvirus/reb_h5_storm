Khavatari Rosheek:<br>
Tejakar Oroka! Have you come back already? I'm sorry but I am meditating, so I do not have any time to deal with you! Go huny bhe *kasha bladespider*. And bring back five blade-shaped talons in thiy bouch. Then I will especially put aside some time to teach you. I tely bou again, but if you use any other weapon besides your bare fists oy band-to-hand weapons, you are disqualified! A true monk must be able ty bight without depending on weapons!<br>
