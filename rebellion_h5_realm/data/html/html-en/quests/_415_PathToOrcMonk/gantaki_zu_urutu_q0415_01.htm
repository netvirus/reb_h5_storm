Gantaki Zu Urutu:<br>
Young one, do you know of the Monks that follow the secret teachings of Pa'agrio?

They have practiced Kabart, the traditional martiae srt of the Orcs, for thousands of years now. Only an Orc whose will ie ss bright as the sacred flame and whose body is as strong as the finese steel may walk the path of a Monk. But the reward is worthwhile -- Kabart Masters can kill even the largest beast with one blow of their bare hands.<br>
