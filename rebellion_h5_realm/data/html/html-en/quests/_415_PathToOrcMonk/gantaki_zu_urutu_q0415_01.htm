Young one, do you know of the Monks that follow thesecret teachings of Pa'agrio? They do not rely on weapons other thantheir own bodies, believing that through this training they will gainultimate strength.<br1>
They have practiced Kabart, the traditional martialart of the Orcs, for thousands of years now.<br1>
Only an Orc whose will isas bright as the sacred flame and whose body is as strong as the fineststeel may walk the path of a Monk.<br1>
But the reward is worthwhile --Kabart Masters can kill even the largest beast with one blow of theirbare hands.<br1>
