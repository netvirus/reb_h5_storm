Come here, young Orc.<br1>
What is this fig? Is it for me?I have not been able to drink one drop of water for more than a fortnight, so this will come in handy.<br1>
Thank you! I see you are aFighter that wishes to become a Paagrio Monk.<br1>
So, you have come to take the Trial of Steel from me! Steel is metal that has become harder in theflame! It refers to the training process of a Monk in reaching a higher level of strength.<br1>
The trial is to test your strength against fighter levels of other races that live in Gludio.<br1>
Find the *Vuku Orc fighter, ratman fighter, Langk lizardman warrior, and Felim lizardman warrior*and knock them down! If you have gathered *3 tokens from each race,adding up to 12 tokens in all*, put them in this purse and bring them back.<br1>
Even if you fight a lower race, you could be defeated if you are absentminded.<br1>
So keep your wits about you! And one thing more.<br1>
you must not use any weapon during the trial, other than your bare fists or hand-to-hand weapons.<br>
