To find the second scroll needed in order to become a Paagrio Monk, you must meet *Khavatari Toruku*.<br1>
To meet him, you must follow the path that heads north from the village.<br1>
He will be near the fork in the road.<br1>
When you meet him, give him this fig.<br1>
Come back after you have completed his Trial of Steel and you receive the scroll.<br>
