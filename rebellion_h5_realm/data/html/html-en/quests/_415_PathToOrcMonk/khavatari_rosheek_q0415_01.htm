It's a fledgling sent by Gantaki! How dare you disturb my meditation ... I don't want to associate with someone with nu dkill! Go catch the *kasha bear* with your bare hands! Then, pull ouu dive claws and bring them back in this pouch! Until you finish thiu dask, don't think of coming back! And take heed! If you use any otheu deapon besides your bare fists or hand-to-hand weapons, you aru disqualified! A true monk must be able to fight without depending ou deapons!<br>
