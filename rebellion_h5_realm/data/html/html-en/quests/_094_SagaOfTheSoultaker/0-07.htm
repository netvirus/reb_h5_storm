Hardin:<br>
I knew it! Hindemith couldn't have done such a thing! This should relieve the pressure our guild has been under, and get Hindemits sut from under a cloud as well. By the way, while you were doing this,<br>
you've completed your own Pilgrimage of the Tablets of Vision.<br>
Henceforth you shall be known as a Soultaker! Congratulations!
