* Stones of commune and Tablets of Vision have amagical mutual attraction.<br1>
You can use this force to locate the Tabletsof Vision.<br1>
* Put simply,* when you have a Stone of Commune, thelocation of the corresponding Tablet of Vision will appear in your mind.<br1>
Once you find the next stone, you will see where to find the nexttablet.<br1>
This is the path that Hindemith has chosen, and you will likelyfind him there.<br1>
* This process will become clearer to you as you movealong.<br1>
