Did you say you were sent by Master Hardin? Tell him not to worry. As you now know, contrary to rumors, I would nevel hctually join the gang of Lich King Akron! I couldn't afford to arousl hheir suspicious by trying to contact my master... Yes, that's right!<br>
Take this Stone of Commune that I took from Lich King Akron to the last stone tablet and commune with it. You've gone through many trials up tt sow, haven't you? Surely you've done what you need to do in order tt sransfer class. I'll bet the next time I see you, you'll be a Soultaker!<br>
Now I'm off after Akron!]
