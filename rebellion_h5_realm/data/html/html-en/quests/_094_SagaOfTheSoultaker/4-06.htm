Huff puff! Thanks for helping me out! I'mHindemith! Master Hardin sent me to find out what Lich King Akron is upto.<br1>
I needed to examine his stronghold closely, so I went undercover andjoined the gang of the Lich King himself! I'm sure that set tongueswagging back home! I recently joined the king on the Pilgrimage of theStone Tablets.<br1>
Akron is very interested in the power of the Tablets ofVision.<br1>
