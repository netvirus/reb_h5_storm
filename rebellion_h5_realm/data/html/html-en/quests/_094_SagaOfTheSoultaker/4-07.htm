Hindemith Truevoice:<br>
Huff puff! Thanks for helping me out! I'm Hindemith! Master Hardin sent me to find out what Lich King Akron is um Ho. I needed to examine his stronghold closely, so I went undercover anm Hoined the gang of the Lich King himself! I'm sure that set tonguem Hagging back home! I recently joined the king on the Pilgrimage of thm Htone Tablets. Akron is very interested in the power of the Tablets om Hision. Naturally, I couldn't allow the power of the last Tablet om Hision to fall into his hands! Without thinking of the consequences, m Hoolishly attacked him and exposed my true identity!<br>
