Oh, you're back! Did you find Hindemith? I supposehe'd already been there, eh? His pilgrimage of the stone tablets isnearing fulfillment.<br1>
Once he's completed it, it will be impossible tofind him! You must find him quickly! I'll search for him as well.<br1>
I do have the Stone of Commune, but you can't have it.<br1>
I'll need it tofind Hindemith.<br1>
I can tell you how to find your own stone, however.<br1>
