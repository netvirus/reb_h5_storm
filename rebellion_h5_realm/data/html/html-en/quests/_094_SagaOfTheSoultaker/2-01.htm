Ah, I heard that you were coming! Do youremember when Lich King Akron's gang slaughtered the priests of GoddardCastle Town, and then murdered the party sent out to search for them? Iheard that Hindemith was seen with the gang at the site of the massacre,but why would he do such a thing? I'm determined to get to the bottomof this, but as you can see, I can't just pick up and leave! Would youhelp me? By the way.<br1>
