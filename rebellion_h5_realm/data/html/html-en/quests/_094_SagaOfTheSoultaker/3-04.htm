Go to* the Ketra Orcs or the Varka Silenos* to*get the missing fragment, the Divine Stone of Wisdom* .<br1>
They both knowthe mysterious knowledge of the stone, but not its exact use.<br1>
They'llgive it to the wisest of the tribe.<br1>
So, it is presented as some kind ofmark for &lsquo;the wisest man of the tribe.<br1>
' If you earn the trust ofAsefa, guide of dead souls, through Ketra's Messenger Wahkan and proveto her your wisdom, you'll find it.<br1>
Or, you can get the Divine Stone ofWisdom from Soul Guide Udan Mardui through Varka's Messenger NaranAshanuk by gaining his trust and proving your wisdom.<br1>
Either way isfine.<br1>
