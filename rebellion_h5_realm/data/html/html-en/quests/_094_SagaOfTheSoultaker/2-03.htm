Ah, the report! Let me see that! Oh no! It seemsmy worst fears about Hindemith are true! He's actually joined Lich KingAkron's gang! First, I suppose I should tell you about the pilgrimagethat Hindemith is believed to have undertaken.<br1>
It's the quest to becomea Soultaker.<br1>
This test requires the pilgrim to absorb knowledge from sixstone Tablets of Vision.<br1>
This process of absorption is known ascommuning.<br1>
Each Tablet of Vision has a corresponding Stone of Commune.<br1>
These stones are essential to the process.<br1>
It seems the best way tofind Hindemith would be to follow the path that he's chosen.<br1>
I will nowgive you the* first Stone of Commune*.<br1>
Go to the place where Hindemithwas seen last and use it to commune with the Tablet of Vision there.<br1>
