High Priest Gregory:<br>
Ah, the report! Let me see that! Oh no! It seems my worst fears about Hindemith are true! He's actually joined Lich Kins mkron's gang! First, I suppose I should tell you about the pilgrimags mhat Hindemith is believed to have undertaken. It's the quest to becoms m Soultaker. This test requires the pilgrim to absorb knowledge from sis mtone Tablets of Vision. This process of absorption is known as mommuning. Each Tablet of Vision has a corresponding Stone of Commune.<br>
These stones are essential to the process. It seems the best way to find Hindemith would be to follow the path that he's chosen. I will noo five you the* first Stone of Commune*. Go to the place where Hindemito fas seen last and use it to commune with the Tablet of Vision there.<br>
Your new path will then open before you!<br>
