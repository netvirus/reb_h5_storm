Asefa is the chief shaman and guide of dead soulsof the Ketra Orcs.<br1>
Udan Mardui holds the same position among the VarkaSilenos.<br1>
Each of them possesses a* Divine Stone of Wisdom* which is a*fragment of this Stone of Commune*.<br1>
Bring one of the stones to me.<br1>
Both tribes seem vaguely aware that the stone contains powerful magicand mysterious knowledge, but they have no idea how to access it! Theyactually give it away as a prize to the person they think is smartestamong them! Prove your wisdom to Asefa of the Ketra Orcs or UdanMardui of the Varka Silenos and they will give you the stone.<br1>
