Um.<br1>
.<br1>
I'd like to support you, but.<br1>
can youdemonstrate that you indeed have the ability to rule the territory? Ifso, you'll definitely have my support.<br1>
I heard that you solved theproblem of Pavel's Ruins.<br1>
How about you deal with the Golems that haveinfested that place now? You don't have to destroy them all, obviously!Defeating even 300 or so Golems near the ancient research center willhelp us feel much safer here.<br1>
