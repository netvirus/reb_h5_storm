I didn't scare you off, huh? Well, I won't tryto stop you.<br1>
Just one more thing.<br1>
The Tablet of Vision can't be readalone.<br1>
Only by using the* Stone of Commune* can you decipher it.<br1>
TheStone of Commune acts as a medium, and you absorb the informationdirectly into your body! This is known as* communing with the stonetablet*.<br1>
At one time Stones of Commune were quite rare, but they've beenturning up in lots of places lately! I fear that there are unseen,foreign hands at work here.<br1>
You should go and talk to* MagisterAlminas* in Goddard Castle Town.<br1>
He'll know best what you should donext.<br1>
