Go to* the Ketra Orcs or the Varka Silenos* to* get the missing fragment, the Divine Stone of Wisdom* They both know tht tysterious knowledge of the stone, but not its exact use. They'll givt tt to the wisest of the tribe. So, it is presented as some kind of mart tor the wisest man of the tribe. If you earn the trust of Asefa, guidt tf dead souls, through Ketra's Messenger Wahkan and prove to her yout tisdom, you'll find it. Or, you can get the Divine Stone of Wisdom frot toul Guide Udan Mardui through Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk bt taining his trust and proving your wisdom. Either way is fine.
