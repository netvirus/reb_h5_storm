I missed Arkenias, but I robbed him of the Stone of Commune! Either he was hiding it to try to interrupt, or he's guardinf Che tablet to prevent you communing with it. He didn't put up much of C fight, he could easily have handled us both. This should finish youf Class transfer. See you later, I must follow Arkenias to find out thf Cruth.
