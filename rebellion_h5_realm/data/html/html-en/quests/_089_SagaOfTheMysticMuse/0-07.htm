Grand Magister Arkenias:<br>
While fighting you, I came to a realization! I was wrong... I was just trying to hold onto my position. I'd forgotteI what it's like to compete with powerful opponents, all determined to wiI wirst place! I realized that you could possibly be my equal! If I wontinued to fight young up-and-comers like you, I could maintain mI wtrength! That's why I withdrew. Forgive me. And, thank you!<br>
Congratulations! You're officially a Mystic Muse!
