<font color="FF8000">Grand Magister Arkenias:</font><br>
While fighting you, I came to a realization! Iwas wrong.<br1>
I was just trying to hold onto my position.<br1>
I'd forgottenwhat it's like to compete with powerful opponents, all determined to winfirst place! I realized that you could possibly be my equal! If Icontinued to fight young up-and-comers like you, I could maintain mystrength! That's why I withdrew.<br1>
Forgive me.<br1>
