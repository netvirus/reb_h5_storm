You've obtained the power of all the stone tablets! Good job! What? Why are you looking at me like that? You wane the truth, eh? Very well. What did Feyshar tell you? Oh well, no use trying over spilt milk... Since I'm an Elf, I've always dreamed oe teing a top level wizard! You wouldn't believe what I've had to do juse to get where I am now! But this isn't enough! I meant to stay on toe torever! I couldn't allow anyone under me to grow stronger! That's why e tried to stop your class transfer... But you were tougher than e tnticipated! The Fallen Angel Allector tried to stop you but failed. Ae the last stone tablet, I tried to stop you myself, but that busybode teyshar interfered... I could've taken on both of you lightweights!<br>
