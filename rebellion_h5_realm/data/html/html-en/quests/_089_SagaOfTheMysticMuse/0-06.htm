You've obtained the power of all the stonetablets! Good job! What? Why are you looking at me like that? You wantthe truth, eh? Very well.<br1>
What did Feyshar tell you? Oh well, no usecrying over spilt milk.<br1>
Since I'm an Elf, I've always dreamed ofbeing a top level wizard! You wouldn't believe what I've had to do justto get where I am now! But this isn't enough! I meant to stay on topforever! I couldn't allow anyone under me to grow stronger! That's why Itried to stop your class transfer.<br1>
But you were tougher than Ianticipated! The Fallen Angel Allector tried to stop you but failed.<br1>
Atthe last stone tablet, I tried to stop you myself, but that busybodyFeyshar interfered.<br1>
