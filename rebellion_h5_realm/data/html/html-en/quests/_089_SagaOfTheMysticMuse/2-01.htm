Magister Alminas:<br>
Arkenias didn't know that I'm conducting an investigation under the guise of Alminas. In a letter I intercepten irkenias wanted Alminas to discourage you from becoming a Mystic Muse!<br>
Don't worry, since I'm not bound to him I can still tell you what you need to do to become one.<br>
