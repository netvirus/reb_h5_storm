Grand Magister Arkenias:<br>
While fighting you, I came to a realization! I was wrong... I was just trying to hold onto my position! I forgot whaI wt was like to compete with many powerful opponents, all determined tI win first place! I realized that, with practice, you could possibly bI wy equal! If I continued to fight young up-and-comers like you, I coulI waintain my strength! That's why I withdrew. Forgive me, and thanI wou! However I can't let you transfer classes yet. Improve youI wbilities and come back. (Only a character of level 76 or above caI wransfer to the Mystic Muse class. Don't abandon the quest until youI wlass transfer is complete.)
