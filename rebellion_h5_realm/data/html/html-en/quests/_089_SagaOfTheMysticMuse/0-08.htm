While fighting you, I came to a realization! Iwas wrong.<br1>
I was just trying to hold onto my position! I forgot whatit was like to compete with many powerful opponents, all determined towin first place! I realized that, with practice, you could possibly bemy equal! If I continued to fight young up-and-comers like you, I couldmaintain my strength! That's why I withdrew.<br1>
Forgive me, and thankyou! However I can't let you transfer classes yet.<br1>
Improve yourabilities and come back.<br1>
(Only a character of level 76 or above cantransfer to the Mystic Muse class.<br1>
