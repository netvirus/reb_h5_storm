Silver Feyshar:<br>
Let me introduce myself. I'm Feyshar, not Alminas as you may remember me. Somebody is hindering the transfer to Mystic Muse,<br>
so I was investigating in disguise. The real Alminas is probably back to Goddard Castle Town by now. As I suspected, Grand Magister Arkenias io Gehind it! You showed up while I was finding out the truth. You saw hio Gn disguise before.<br>
