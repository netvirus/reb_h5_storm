Guard Harlan:<br>
Apology accepted, my friend... I suppose I overreacted. To mark the birth of my daughter I want to make fantasy wine. The recipe has been in my family for many generations. When she marries I wile herve it at her wedding! I am lacking some of the ingredients I need te hake the wine. These ingredients have always been rare, but nowadaye ht's practically impossible to get them. To make matters worse, me huties as a guard keep me from going out and finding them myself. Woule hou help me?<br>
