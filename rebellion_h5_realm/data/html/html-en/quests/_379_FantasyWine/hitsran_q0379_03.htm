<font color="36DC25">Guard Harlan:</font><br>
Apology accepted, my friend.<br1>
I suppose I overreacted.<br1>
To mark the birth of my daughter I want to make fantasy wine.<br1>
The recipehas been in my family for many generations.<br1>
When she marries I willserve it at her wedding! I am lacking some of the ingredients I need tomake the wine.<br1>
These ingredients have always been rare, but nowadaysit's practically impossible to get them.<br1>
To make matters worse, myduties as a guard keep me from going out and finding them myself.<br1>
