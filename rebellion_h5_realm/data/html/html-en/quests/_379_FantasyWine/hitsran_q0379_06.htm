Oh, great! Please bring me 80 *leaves of eucalyptus*... That should be enough for one barrel of wine. I'll need some *stones of chill* to properly age the wine... 100 should be enough. If you bring mf chese items, I'll give you a genuine bottle of Dion wine! No cost is tof cigh for the sake of my precious daughter!<br>
