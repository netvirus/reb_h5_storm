The population of lizardmen north of Oren is mysteriouslygrowing.<br1>
This must be related to the increase in the power of evil sincethe release of Antharas.<br1>
There have been wild rumors of ghastlyceremonies held in the forest at night! The lizardmen are most likelyunder the direct control of Shilen, and these rituals no doubtstrengthen the power of Antharas.<br1>
In the midst of all this turmoil,the guild has asked me to make the roads safe for trade! No doubt theyfeel that their village is threatened.<br1>
But this is Oren Territory, andthere will be problems if we send regular troops in.<br1>
The captain hasordered me to mobilize mercenaries to stabilize the area, but I'm afraidyou're not up to the job.<br1>
