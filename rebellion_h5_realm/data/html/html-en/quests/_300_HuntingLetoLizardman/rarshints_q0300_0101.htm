The population of lizardman on the north side of Oren ismysteriously growing.<br1>
This must be related to the increase in the powerof evil since the release of Antharas.<br1>
There have been wild rumors ofghastly ceremonies held in the forest at night! The lizardman are mostlikely under the direct control of Shilen, and these rituals no doubtstreng then the power of Antharas.<br1>
In the midst of all this turmoil,the guild has asked me to make the roads safe for trade! No doubt theyfeel that their village is threatened.<br1>
But this is Oren Territory, andthere will be problems if we send regular troops in.<br1>
The captain hasordered me to mobilize mercenaries to stabilize the area.<br1>
