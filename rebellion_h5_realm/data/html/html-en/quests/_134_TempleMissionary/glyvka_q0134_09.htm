We serve Einhasad, the goddess of light, order andpower.<br1>
Eons ago, Einhasad imprisoned Shilen, the evil goddess of death.<br1>
She also destroyed the Giants, who in their arrogance and corruptionsought to dethrone the gods themselves.<br1>
The people of this continentlong served Einhasad in faithfulness and righteousness.<br1>
Recently,however, we have encountered signs that Shilen's influence is againgrowing: groups of disciples devoted to preparing her return, and hordesof monsters that have invaded the peaceful regions of our land.<br1>
<br>In this age of rival warlords and ambitious adventurers, the chaosnecessary for evil to prevail is all too prevalent.<br1>
It is our task touse all our resources to preserve order and carry out Einhasad's will.<br1>
