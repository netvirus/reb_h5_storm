Uh.<br1>
perhaps I've said too much.<br1>
I do not knowwhy the Temple is interested in the ancient Giants' technology.<br1>
Perhapsit is simply in order to keep it away from the traitors, or to counterits effects should it fall into the wrong hands.<br1>
How can I understandthe subtle strategies of the Temple's leaders? In any case, please passthis report to Priestess Glyvka.<br1>
