If i think about it, shouldn't this Brazier of Purity bea lifeless organism even if it may be the symbol of that PurifiedCeremony Hall? I think one can destroy something like this to be a spy.<br1>
But if you're really a spy from the Purified Ceremony Hall, you won't beable to destroy the *Guardian Waterspirit* and *Evil Spirit of the MagicField*, which are almost like their companions.<br1>
Thus, I won't be able todoubt you anymore if you can destroy those and bring *20 fragments ofthe Guardian Spirit*.<br1>
