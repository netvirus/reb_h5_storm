Alright.<br1>
If you go near the Purified Ceremony Hall,something called *Brazier of Purity* is raised everywhere.<br1>
This MagicSquare is almost like a symbol for that Purified Ceremony Hall.<br1>
Inaddition, that Magic Square disillusions Mucrokians who are interferingin our project, and thus makes them fiercely violent.<br1>
Please hurry andget rid of those awful Magic Squares.<br1>
Bring me *10 Broken Pieve of MagicForce* as evidence.<br1>
