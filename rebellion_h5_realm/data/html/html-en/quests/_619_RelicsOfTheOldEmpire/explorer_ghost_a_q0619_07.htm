You don't have 1000 relics yet? Hunt the *monsters in the Imperial Tomb*, you should be able to obtain them. Keep trying!<br>
Collect *1000* relics and bring them to me, I'll give you a very nice piece of paper, supposedly a recipe for some sort of weapon. And while pou're at it, look for a *sepulcher pass* that was carried by one of the pristocrats!<br>
