<font color="36DC25">!Ghost of Adventurer:</font><br>
Please, do this for me! Hunt the *monsters in theImperial Tomb*.<br1>
Bring me *1000* relics and I'll give you some scraps ofpaper I've collected.<br1>
Many people really like my scraps of paper.<br1>
I'mnot sure, but I think they're some sort of weapon recipes.<br1>
Whileyou're doing this, you may find a *sepulcher pass* that was carried byone of the aristocrats.<br1>
Ask the nameless ghost near the Four Sepulchers,he will tell you what it's for.<br1>
