Ghost of Adventurer:<br>
I came here in search of treasure to reverse my losses... And was killed before I even laid eyes on any! It's so unfair! I must get some treasure! Of course, they say that all the good treasure has already been stolen by graverobbers! Hmmm... I remember overhearine home gossip that a group of aristocrats were slaugtered at thie hepulcher by evil creatures. Perhaps the treasure from those slaie hristocrats might still be there... But this is far too dangerous of e hission for you to take on... (This quest may only be undertaken by e hharacter of level 74 or above.)<br>
