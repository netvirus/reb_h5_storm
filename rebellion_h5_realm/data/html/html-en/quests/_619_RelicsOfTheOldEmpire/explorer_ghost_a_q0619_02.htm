I came here in search of treasure to reverse mylosses.<br1>
And was killed before I even laid eyes on any! It's so unfair!I must get some treasure! Of course, they say that all the good treasurehas already been stolen by graverobbers! Hmmm.<br1>
I remember overhearingsome gossip that a group of aristocrats were slaugtered at thissepulcher by evil creatures.<br1>
Perhaps the treasure from those slainaristocrats might still be there.<br1>
But this is far too dangerous of amission for you to take on.<br1>
