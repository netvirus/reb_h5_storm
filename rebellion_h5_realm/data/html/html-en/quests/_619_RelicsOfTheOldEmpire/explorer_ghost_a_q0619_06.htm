You don't have 1000 relics yet? Hunt the *monstersin the Imperial Tomb*, you should be able to obtain them.<br1>
Keep trying!Collect *1000* relics and bring them to me, I'll give you a very nicepiece of paper, supposedly a recipe for some sort of weapon.<br1>
Ah, I seethat you have the *sepulcher pass*! Ask the *nameless ghost near theFour Sepulchers*, he'll tell you what it's for.<br1>
