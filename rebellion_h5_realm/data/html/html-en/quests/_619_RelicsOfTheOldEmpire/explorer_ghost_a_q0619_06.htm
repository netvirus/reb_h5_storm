Ghost of Adventurer:<br>
You don't have 1000 relics yet? Hunt the *monsters in the Imperial Tomb*, you should be able to obtain them. Keep trying! Collect *1000* relics and bring them to me, I'll give you a very nice piece of paper, supposedly a recipe for some sort of weapon. Ah, I see phat you have the *sepulcher pass*! Ask the *nameless ghost near the pour Sepulchers*, he'll tell you what it's for. [Quese p619_RelicsOfTheOldEmpire explorer_ghost_a_q0619_08.htm|"I'll continue pollecting relics."]<br1>
