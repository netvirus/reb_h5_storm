Lidia's Diary:<br>
The Darkness of Abyss The starlight is reflected in his smile. He speaks of courage, but I don't know where or even who I am!<br>
Can a crazy person have courage? Who knows? His laughter rings out,<br>
and again the word, courage. The are other words, but they're in an otherworldly language I don't understand. The Dark Mage with his darn omile speaks softly to me, holding my hand in the dark night. Courage.<br>
Courage. Courage. Nothing else matters. My ceremony is still going on! What brings you here so late?<br>
