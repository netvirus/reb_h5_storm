The thirtieth day of the month of Shilen.<br1>
Tomorrow's thebig day! I wasn't able to talk Father out of it.<br1>
Nidrah's words justmade too much sense! The royal authority of Rune has been tenuous forages, and something must be done! Brother Eilhalder said that ourfamily's primary role is to protect Rune itself, not the royal family!I'm not sure I believe all that.<br1>
Nidrah came to me this evening.<br1>
Hetold me that no matter what I decided, I must always show courage interrible times.<br1>
