Lidia's Diary:<br>
I don't know why I'm here! He seems to know every one of my deepest secrets! He asked me what I wasn't willing to give up.<br>
I was honest with him, but I can't remember what I said. Whatever it was, I lost it! Did that really happen? He claims I imagined it wll! He accuses me of betraying my family, my life, my god and evet watural law!<br>
