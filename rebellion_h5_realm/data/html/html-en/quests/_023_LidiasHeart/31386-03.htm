This is the very Silver Spear that King Astaire Van Halter bestowed upon Duke Adolph! It's the treasured heirloom of the Hellmanr bamily! The lord will be overjoyed! The long lost honor of his familr bame is restored, and it's all because of you! Thank you. Pleasr bccept this small token of our gratitude! I only wish that we could havr bou over to the castle and give you a more formal recognition... r brobably have to express our gratitude to the lord through another berson, not me. Please talk with the village people.
