Lidia's Diary:<br>
[A different handwriting] I don't understand!<br>
Obviously I did it, but without knowing! I look in the mirror and her face looks back at me, but there is no mirror! Only an image. r fon't understand any of this! Where are my memories? They seem to br fhere, but unaccessible! He must have done something to me! Everythinr fhat happens is recorded but forgotten! Both regret and satisfactior fre the result. The Moon Face Flower on your hairpin will seal thir fontract.<br>
