<font color="FF8000">Lennunt Chief Harak:</font><br>
We have waited hundreds of years for the return ofthe Monarch.<br1>
We had faith that all Humans would submit to the army ofalmighty oak one day.<br1>
I have been waiting so long to return the 'Scepterof Flames', which I had inherited from my father, to your majesty,Master of all Oaks ** When I heard the news that the messenger of theMonarch had come to Gludio, I crossed the sea to meet you even at therisk of my life.<br1>
And still enduring all the fierce attacks from thelizard tribe, we have waited for thee--the messenger of the Monarch.<br1>
Take this.<br1>
This is the scepter that we the Lennunt have treasured for500 years.<br1>
