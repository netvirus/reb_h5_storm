Have you recovered the seal of the Tantos tribe?With this, the wrath of the Tantos tribe's ancestral spirits will besomewhat appeased.<br1>
But it is not enough to wash ourselves of our sins.<br1>
Ihear that the Ragna tribe are behind this.<br1>
on top of betraying us, nowthey directly challenge my authority! A ruthless vengeance will rainupon the betrayer tribe! Are the seals in this box the seals you haverecovered from the lesser tribes of the other regions? Surely these havebeen given along with a pledge of devotion, or through the deliveranceof a swift punishment to those who did not obey? You have done well,Warrior of my race! I still remember when you first came to me, freshfrom your training from the Paagrio temple and in utter bewilderment.<br1>
