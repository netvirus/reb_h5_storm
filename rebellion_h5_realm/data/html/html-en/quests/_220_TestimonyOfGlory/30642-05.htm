Good work, Envoy of the Lord! I see you haverecovered the *Scepters of the Breka, Enku, Vuku, Turek, and Lennunttribes*! It shall not be long before all 108 Orc tribes are reunitedunder the Lord of Flame! Now is the time to face the *Timak and Tamlintribes* of the north! The last envoys I sent to them lost their heads!These tribes are savage beasts that have forgotten the most commoncourtesy! Fools that have forsaken the pride and identity of Orcs! A warhas been declared to bring these tribes into the fold.<br1>
