Good! Then, I Prefect Vokiyan, shall give you theorders! Find the magical creatures that I point out from now on, conquerthem and bring back the proof of your victory! First, if you go near theIvory Tower of Oren, you'll find *Manasen*, the so-called 'flying stonestatue'.<br1>
Break him into pieces and bring 10 shards of his body as thetrophy! Next, if you go to the wasteland area of Gludio, there are the*Paagrio Crusaders * who are often called as the 'tyrants of the wild'.<br1>
