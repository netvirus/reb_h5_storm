The goblin grave thieves have been incited by the Ragnatribe to destroy the tombs.<br1>
That is what the spirits of wind whisperedinto my ears.<br1>
The scepter is now in the hands of Ragna tribe.<br1>
I don'tknow any further information but the fact that the *Chief or the Seer ofRagna tribe* has it.<br1>
They are trying to call out the spirit of Tantostribe leader with the scepter.<br1>
At this very moment, they are trying tocarry out the ceremony, somewhere on the *Indomitable Plateau*.<br1>
