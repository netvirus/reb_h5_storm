Good job! At last we found the *Scepter of Tantos*, whichhad been stolen from the ancestors' tombs by those filthy grave robbers!The betrayers of Ragna were trying to summon the spirit of Tantosthrough the ceremony and harm the Lord! But thanks to you, their wickedplan failed! I shall put the Scepter of Tantos with the other sceptersof flame that you have recovered! Now, with the ceremonial box whichincludes the scepters, thou, young Orc shall proceed to meet *LordKakai*! He will praise your achievement and contribution and grant youthe Mark of Glory!<br1>
