<font color="FF8000">Vuku Chief Driko:</font><br>
For us, survival is the greatest virtue.<br1>
I expectedthat there will come a day when this seal will be traded for the safetyof our tribe.<br1>
We have many difficulties in this area where there areoften conflicts with Men.<br1>
We are planning to go back to our base camps.<br1>
We are moving to the eastern swamp area.<br1>
But the reason we moved here inthe first place was because of the grotesque insect tribe which drove usout.<br1>
*If you sweep them from our area, I will give you back the Scepterof Flame of yours*.<br1>
