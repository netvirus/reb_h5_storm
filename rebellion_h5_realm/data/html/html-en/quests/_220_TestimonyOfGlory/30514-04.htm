To reconstruct the kingdom of Orcs, we must firstovercome the disruption within the kingdom! We must *make the lowerclass Orcs return to the kingdom*, who hundreds of years ago, denied theLord of Flame's authority and revolted against him! If you take chargeof the task to subjugate the lower class Orcs under the great kingdom ofOrc, you will be recognized for your contributions to the kingdom and berewarded with a Mark of Glory by the Monarch.<br1>
