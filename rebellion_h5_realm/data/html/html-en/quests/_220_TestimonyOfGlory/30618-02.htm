Thank you for coming such a long way, messenger ofthe flame Monarch.<br1>
We, the lennunt tribe were dispatched to conquerTalking Island 500 years ago when war broke out with Humans.<br1>
Right afterthe incident, we were isolated on Talking Island because the main armyhad retreated to the north, but we carried out the commands of the Lordwith loyalty.<br1>
The 'Elven School of Wizardry' of Talking Island wasruined and all its legacies had turn into ashes.<br1>
Even to this day, wethe Warriors of Lennunt are defending against another possible invasionby the Humans.<br1>
