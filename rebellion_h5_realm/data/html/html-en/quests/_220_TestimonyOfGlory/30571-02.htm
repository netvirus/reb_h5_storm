<font color="36DC25">Seer Tanapi:</font><br>
Some time ago, the goblin grave robbers destroyed ourancestors' tomb and ran away with the *Scepter of Tantos*.<br1>
As you know,the Tantos tribe was executed for high treason 100 years ago.<br1>
But lateron, it turned out that it was a misunderstanding caused by the wickedDwarves' mischief and the Paagrio Lord mourned bitterly his mistake.<br1>
Every year we hold a memorial service to seek forgiveness from ourfalsely charged brothers of Tantos and comfort their souls.<br1>
If yourecover the Scepter of Tantos, I am sure the Monarch will be verypleased.<br1>
