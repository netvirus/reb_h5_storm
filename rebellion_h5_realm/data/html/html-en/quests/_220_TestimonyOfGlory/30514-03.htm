Do you know! Seers are all saying that the eternalwinter is approaching! It won't be long.<br1>
We must prepare for the daysof chaos and destruction, and the distressed days of endless wars anddisasters.<br1>
People of your tribe are weak and idle.<br1>
We can't expectanything from them.<br1>
We are stronger than any other tribe! We shallconquer all the inferior tribes and reconstruct the *great kingdom ofOrcs to fight against the darkness of the chaotic days.<br1>
