<font color="36DC25">Prefect Vokiyan:</font><br>
Did you forget my orders already! I, Vokiyan neverspeaks twice! I shall forgive you one last time, so you'd betterremember this time! First, if you go near the Ivory Tower of Oren,you'll find *Manasen*, the so-called 'flying stone statue'.<br1>
Break himinto pieces and bring 10 shards of his body as the trophy! Next, if yougo to the wastelands of Gludio, there are the *Paagrio Crusader* who areoften called as the 'tyrants of the wild'.<br1>
