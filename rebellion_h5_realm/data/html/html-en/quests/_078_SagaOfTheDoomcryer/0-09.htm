If you can commune with even one dead soul, youwill transcend the power of a Warcryer! Now your power will exceedthat of the one who can communicate with 99 dead souls! You willcommunicate with all dead souls at once, and your cries will ring outevery place you go! You'll become like a lamp, shining brightly,guiding everyone along the path as the winter approaches! The ancestorsand dead souls will commune with all Orcs through you! Your roars shallpierce the most severe winter, oh Doom Cryer!<br1>
