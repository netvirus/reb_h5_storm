Take this stone that the god of fire himselfentrusted to me! It contains many powers.<br1>
The greatest of all is thepower to recover forgotten memories from the era of heroes.<br1>
Thememories are stored in Tablets of Vision, distributed throughout theworld.<br1>
You'll find the first just south of the Tower of Insolence.<br1>
When you've communed with all the stone tablets, you'll know whether ornot you'll endure the coming winter.<br1>
