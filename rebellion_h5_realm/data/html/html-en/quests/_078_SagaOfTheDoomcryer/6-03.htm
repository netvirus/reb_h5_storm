Countless thoughts beyond comprehension searpainfully into your brain.<br1>
You hear the faint whisper of a woman'svoice.<br1>
A vision appears of a small lizard, trapped in a box.<br1>
Theharder he struggles, the tighter his prison becomes.<br1>
This is a closedtotem.<br1>

Alas, thepower of the totem eventually grew too strong for Mudaha, and now hestruggles just to keep the power in check! You can find him inside themaze at the Wall of Argos.<br1>
That Stone of Commune will be the end ofhim.<br1>
