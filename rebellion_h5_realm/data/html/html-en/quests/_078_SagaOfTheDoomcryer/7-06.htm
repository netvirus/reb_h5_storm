Countless thoughts beyond comprehension searpainfully into your brain.<br1>
You hear the faint whisper of a woman'svoice.<br1>
The temptation of Varangkam brought forth the ability tomaintain control over the spirit.<br1>
Ghosts are divine and full of power.<br1>
Ironically, they can still be quite helpful yet difficult to control.<br1>
As such, there is much stryfe between the seer and the ghost.<br1>
You seeSharuhi going out of Mudaha's body.<br1>
He becomes a spirit and protects theland.<br1>
The person that was overlooked is Goddard Castle Town's seer,Skahi.<br1>
Go find him.<br1>
