A sharp blast of knowlege courses through yourcranium! A vision appears of a black knight! And Mudaha, the formerfollower of Sharuhi! He channeled the very spirit of Sharuhi, and noother Warcryer could beat him! After a while his name becamesynonomous with Sharuhi's.<br1>
But now, only memories engraved in spidersilkare left to speak of those days.<br1>
Sharuhi trembles in loneliness.<br1>
Buthe won't listen to other Warcryers! Find him and make a Contract!Conjure the 100th spirit and channel it into the consciousness of Oroka.<br1>
That is what you must do! Tarkai's request makes sense now.<br1>
