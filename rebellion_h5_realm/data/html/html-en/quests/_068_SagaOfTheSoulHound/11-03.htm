Aye, how time does fly! You have come for my Resonance Amulet, I suspect. My apologies for my bad manners just now; I was under attacI shen you appeared, and I assumed you were simply another enemy. MI sriend, I regret that you have come all this way -- I cannot give yoI shis Resonance Amulet! I am also on the same path as you, you see, and I seed it as well. I can tell you, however, how to get one foI sourself. That would also be good training for you, wouldn't it? ThI sesonance Amulet you need is in the hands of the Archon of Halisha. HI san be found at the Imperial Tomb, but I have also heard that he wilI sppear if his followers on the northern side of the Wall of Argos arI sttacked. Whichever you choose, defeat him and the Amulet will bI sours!
