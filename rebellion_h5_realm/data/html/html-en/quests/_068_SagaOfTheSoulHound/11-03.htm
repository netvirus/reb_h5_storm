Aye, how time does fly! You have come for my Resonance Amulet, Isuspect.<br1>
My apologies for my bad manners just now; I was under attackwhen you appeared, and I assumed you were simply another enemy.<br1>
Myfriend, I regret that you have come all this way -- I cannot give youthis Resonance Amulet! I am also on the same path as you, you see, and Ineed it as well.<br1>
I can tell you, however, how to get one foryourself.<br1>
That would also be good training for you, wouldn't it? TheResonance Amulet you need is in the hands of the Archon of Halisha.<br1>
Hecan be found at the Imperial Tomb, but I have also heard that he willappear if his followers on the northern side of the Wall of Argos areattacked.<br1>
