<font color="36DC25">Hierarch Kekropus:</font><br>
When we Kamael were revealed to the world, it wasagreed that that power would remain sealed.<br1>
Unless.<br1>
should one of ourown prove worthy to wield it, it would be permitted.<br1>
If you are thatperson, you will be able to unbind the seals and obtain the power youseek.<br1>
I can only show you the way, however; the rest depends on yourstrength and character.<br1>
If you succeed, I will wish to speak with youagain about the destiny you have embraced.<br1>
