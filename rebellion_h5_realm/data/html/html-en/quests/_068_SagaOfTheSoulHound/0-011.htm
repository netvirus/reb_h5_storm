Because I knew that you would come to me, I want totell you about a question that will appear at the end of the road thatyou intend to travel.<br1>
I suspect that once you hear what I have to saythe answer will become plain.<br1>
We Kamael re-entered this world withcertain limitations, since the power we potentially wield may have aprofound and lasting impact on all the races.<br1>
A portion of that powerwas sealed to prevent its misuse.<br1>
But those who prove themselves worthmay still unlock that power within themselves.<br1>
