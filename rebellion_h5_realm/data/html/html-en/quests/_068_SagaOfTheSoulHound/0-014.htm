<font color="FF8000">Hierarch Kekropus:</font><br>
When the gods laid the foundations of this world,they appointed the Giants -- strongest of all their creations -- to ruleit as their stewards.<br1>
Gradually, though, the Giants became disillusionedwith their masters, until they could only see the gods' flaws and noneof their virtues.<br1>
The seeds of rebellion were born.<br1>
Rationalizing thatthey had need to defend the themselves, the Giants created both theKamael, including the three Spicula heroes, and mighty weapons capableof inflicting harm on the gods themselves.<br1>
The Giants grew exceedinglypowerful, and Einhasad became suspicious.<br1>
She discovered their secreexperiments and became wrathful.<br1>
Unable to convince the other gods ofthe threat, she in her fury attacked the Giants alone.<br1>
Taken bysurprise, the Giants were thrown back.<br1>
Finally, they committed theKamael to the war, and the tide began to turn.<br1>
The Spicula Harkilgamedused the legendary sword Enuma Elish to slay Einhasad's second daughter,while Katenar bombarded the goddess' army with the mighty cannonLeopold.<br1>
The battle seemed to shift in favor of the Giants, who rejoicedat the might of their arms.<br1>
Too soon, as it happened.<br1>
