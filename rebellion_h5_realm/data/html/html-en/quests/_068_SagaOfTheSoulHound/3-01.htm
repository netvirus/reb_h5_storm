Why have you come to me? The Resonance Amulet?Ah! Wait a moment.<br1>
You are probably the owner of this item.<br1>
Someonecame to me some time ago with this broken lump and asked me to repairit.<br1>
Don't ask me about that person -- he came suddenly at night, so Inever got a clear look at him.<br1>
Then he simply.<br1>
disappeared.<br1>
But he didsay one thing before leaving: he told me to fix it and give it to theone who came asking about it.<br1>
Unfortunately, I've been able to figureout how to fix it, but I lack some key ingredients.<br1>
If you can get thosefor me, I can repair this.<br1>
