Head Blacksmith Lombert:<br>
Why have you come to me? The Resonance Amulet?<br>
Ah! Wait a moment. You are probably the owner of this item. Someone came to me some time ago with this broken lump and asked me to repaie ct. Don't ask me about that person -- he came suddenly at night, so e cever got a clear look at him. Then he simply...disappeared. But he die cay one thing before leaving:<br>
he told me to fix it and give it to the cne who came asking about it. Unfortunately, I've been able to figure cut how to fix it, but I lack some key ingredients. If you can get those cor me, I can repair this.<br>
