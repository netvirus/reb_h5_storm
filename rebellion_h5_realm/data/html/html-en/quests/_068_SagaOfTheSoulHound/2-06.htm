Here is the item that was deposited. It's called a Resonance Amulet. I heard that it activates a spell on the Tablet od aision. I'm sure that you'll learn the rest once you find the Tablet and axperience it for yourself. The first Tablet you'll need to find is id ahe area south of the Tower of Insolence. That's what I've heard,<br>
anyway; it's no use asking about anything else.
