Here is the item that was deposited.<br1>
It's calleda Resonance Amulet.<br1>
I heard that it activates a spell on the Tablet ofVision.<br1>
I'm sure that you'll learn the rest once you find the Tablet andexperience it for yourself.<br1>
The first Tablet you'll need to find is inthe area south of the Tower of Insolence.<br1>
That's what I've heard,anyway; it's no use asking about anything else.<br1>
