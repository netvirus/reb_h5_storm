Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
Once we were created as weapons to oppose the gods,<br>
but now, I think we must shape our own destiny as a race. I hope you are the one to free us from the constraints of the wheel of fate, the one tho is able to see beyond limitations placed on us. I have faith in you,<br>
