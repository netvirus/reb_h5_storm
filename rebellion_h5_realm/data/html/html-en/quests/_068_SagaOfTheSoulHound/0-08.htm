Once we were created as weapons to oppose the gods,<br>
but now, I think we must shape our own destiny as a race. I hope you are the one to free us from the constraints of the wheel of fate, the one tho is able to see beyond limitations placed on us. I will watch youe trogress with great interest, but I think you are not yet ready te tecome a Soul Hound. Come back to me when you are more experienced.<br>
