Once we were created as weapons to oppose the gods,but now, I think we must shape our own destiny as a race.<br1>
I hope you arethe one to free us from the constraints of the wheel of fate, the onewho is able to see beyond limitations placed on us.<br1>
I will watch yourprogress with great interest, but I think you are not yet ready tobecome a Soul Hound.<br1>
Come back to me when you are more experienced.<br1>
