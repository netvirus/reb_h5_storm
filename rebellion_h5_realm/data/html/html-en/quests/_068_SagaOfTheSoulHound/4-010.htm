His goal is to prevent the Kamael from regaining theirrightful innate power.<br1>
All the problems you've had stem from hisefforts, in fact.<br1>
Here is what he dropped when he fled.<br1>
Take it --you'll need it.<br1>
Ah, I see that you're wondering whether you willachieve the same level of power I have if you release the final seal.<br1>
But you already know who I am, don't you? That's not important rightnow, though -- this concerns more than individual power.<br1>
It concerns thefuture of the Kamael, a future free from the artificial destiniesimposed on mortals by the gods.<br1>
You will be able to forge your ownfate.<br1>
Farewell, my friend.<br1>
