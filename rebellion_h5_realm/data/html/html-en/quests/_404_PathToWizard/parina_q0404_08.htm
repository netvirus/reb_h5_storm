The journey of becoming a Wizard begins with the will of a magician to learn new things.<br1>
Strong will to obtain knowledge is often compared to a flame.<br1>
You must first find the *token of flame*.<br1>
In order to do that, you must meet the *Flame Spirit*.<br1>
*It is in the form of a lizard wrapped up in flames and is near a village damaged during the war, now called the Ruins of Despair.*<br1>
Look for it to the south of the village of Castle Gludio.<br>
