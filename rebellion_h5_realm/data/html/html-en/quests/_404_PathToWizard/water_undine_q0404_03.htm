Oh! Surprisingly, you have some skill!<br1>
Now it will be a little easier for me to purify the water. As I promised, I will give you the token of water.<br1>
Studier of the water, do not be lazy in your quest for truth. When a magician's knowledge reaches a certain level, his understanding of the world turns to steadfast faith.<br1>
The strong will of a magician who tries to change the world with his beliefs is very often compared to the earth.<br1>
The next thing you must find is the *token of earth*. *You can only obtain that by meeting the Earth Snake.<br1>
If you want to meet the snake, you must go to the Grim Ruins.* Just north of here, you will easily find the ruins.<br1>
The Earth Snake may look crude, but it is a very wise spirit, so it is better not to be arrogant in front of it.<br>
