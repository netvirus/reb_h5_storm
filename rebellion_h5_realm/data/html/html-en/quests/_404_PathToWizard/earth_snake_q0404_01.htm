<font color="FFFF00">Earth Snake:</font><br>
Wait! Do not deceive yourself into thinking I am a mere lizard just because I look like a basilisk.<br1>
Although my appearance is unremarkable, I am a spirit of earth, which studies the principles of the world embodied within the soil and rock.<br1>
Right now I am looking for a way to purify the negative forces that have seeped into the earth in these ruins. You say you are looking for the token of earth? Then I must test you to see if you are qualified to earn it.<br1>
Just because the spirits of water, fire and wind have acknowledged you doesn't mean that I will do so as easily. *It is your task to find Red Soil that contains the strong life of the earth.<br1>
You can obtain it by hunting a bear called the red bear that lives in this vicinity.*<br1>
The red bear can be found in the Fellmere Harvesting Grounds between the Ruins of Agony and the Orc Barracks.<br>
