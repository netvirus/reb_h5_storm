<font color="FFFF00">Flame Salamander:</font><br>
What is it, child of Humans? Aren't you frightened by the fumes of fire that I breathe?<br1>
It has been a long time since I've seen a Human as fearless as you. So you've come to find the token of flame?<br1>
Now I see that you are a Mystic who controls the powers of elements! Good ... If you grant me a favor, I will give you the token of flame.<br1>
The key of flame that I had in my charge was stolen not long ago. The rascal that took the key was a *Ratman Warrior*.<br1>
He is in fact an evil spirit in disguise, that covets the power of fire.<br1>
How else could he have tricked me and stolen the key? Please find the scoundrel and recover the key.<br1>
There are many Ratman Warriors north of these ruins or west beyond the mountains.<br>
