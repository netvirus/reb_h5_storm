o become a Human Wizard, you must have the four tokens of water, fire, wind and earth.<br1>
If you are not acknowledged by nature,  which controls these four elements, you do not have the right to be called a Wizard.<br1>
Go out into the world and collect the four tokens.<br1>
The collection of the tokens can only be accomplished by your own power.<br1>
This is all I can do for you.<br>
