<font color="FFFF00">Wind Sylph:</font><br>
Thank you very much. Now I can meditate in peace.<br1>
I was thinking of going to some other land because it was so noisy.<br1>
As a token of my appreciation, I give you the token of wind. Searcher of the wind, please do not forget your naive curiosity about materials.<br1>
Curiosity always leads to investigation. The deep contemplation and research of a magician is very often compared to the deep waters of a lake.<br1>
Now you must find the *token of water*. *In order to find it, you must meet the undine of the water. She is near Permel Lake.*<br1>
The lake can be found if you pass the abandoned camp of the ol mahums in the north and continue a little farther north.<br1>
Well then, may the divine protection of wind be with you.<br>
