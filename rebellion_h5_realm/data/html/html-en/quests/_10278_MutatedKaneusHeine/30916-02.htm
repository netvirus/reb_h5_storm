	Captain Gost$1<br>
	<br> The favor I ask is on behalf of<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Magister Minevia</font> of the Temple of Einhasad.<br>
	The Sages of Magic, a group of magisters of which Magister Minevia is a<br>
	member, are researching the Kaneus:<br>
recently discovered monsters of<br>
	Kamaloka.<br>
	<br> They know that Kamaloka exists between this world and the<br>
	infernal regions; "normal" monsters in that region mutate into the<br>
	Kaneus.<br>
	<br> They do not know the cause of this mutation, however.<br>
	<br> To assist their research into this matter, they asked me to<br>
	obtain some<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">cellular tissues of the Kaneus.</font> Will you<br>
	help me?<br>
	<br><br>
	<font color="LEVEL">(You may only undertake this quest only if<br>
		you are eglible to enter Kamaloka, Hall of the Abyss, level 43.)</font><br>
