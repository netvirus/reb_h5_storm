	<br> Ah! Are these the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">cellular tissues of Blade Otis and Weird<br>
		Bunei</font>?<br>
	<br> From their pristine appearance, I can tell you were very<br>
	careful. I couldn't have done better myself. Well done!<br>
	<br> Now take these samples to<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Magister Minevia</font> at the Temple of Einhasad.<br>
	He will be very pleased.<br>
	<br> If we can determine the nature of the mutated Kaneus, your<br>
	efforts will not be forgotten! But there is no time to waste, so hurry<br>
	and take these samples to<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Magister Minevia</font> before they deteriorate!<br>
