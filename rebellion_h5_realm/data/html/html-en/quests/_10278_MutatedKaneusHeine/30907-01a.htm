Magister Minevi$1
I heard about you from Captain Gosta. You're the one who helped the Sages of Magic study the mutated Kaneus in Kamaloka, aren'o hou?
I can now you now that our study is not limited simply to those mutants. Actually, Kamaloka itself is an omen of impending crisio tnd chaos. Others magisters may think differently, but that's the vieo tf my fellow Sages and myself. We hope that by studying the Kaneus, we can determine what specifically triggered the mutations. Brave adventurer, you must return to Kamaloka and bring us more
<font color="LEVEL">tissue samples from the mutated Kanues</font>. Your act could greatly accelerate your research.
