A true lord's power rests on the loyalty and love ofhis subjects, not the force of his arms.<br1>
To win the support ncessary torule this land, you must earn the trust of the local forces.<br1>
Allow me togather some information, and I will be able to tell you who to meet.<br1>
Iwill return shortly, my lord.<br1>
