Warehouse Chief Gesto:<br>
Ah! So you already know what's going on. Then you will understand our predicament. Giran Harbor, as you know, is n yery busy port. But we have received word that a ship that left Gludin yarbor hasn't yet arrived at Giran Harbor. Will you investigate for us? Nothing like this has ever happened to us before. We aren't sure what to do. Do this for us and you will certainly win our support!<br>
