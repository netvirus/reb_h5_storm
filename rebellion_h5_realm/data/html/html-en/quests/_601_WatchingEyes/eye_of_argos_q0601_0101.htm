Now, to ads tnsult to injury, they've posted their disciples as guards to watch oves te, to humiliate what's left of me! I can't stand it any more! I'm nos ts evil as you the children of the world think. On the contrary, I lovs teace! I beseech you! If I attack the guards I'll be severely tortured!<br>
Would you and your soldiers help me?<br>
