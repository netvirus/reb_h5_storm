I've been waiting for you.<br1>
While you were away I didsome research! I've located the fifth Stone of Commune, butunfortunately, it's already lost its power.<br1>
You must've felt this Stoneof Commune.<br1>
Didn't it feel weaker than before? Fortunately, there aretwo more Stones of Commune like that one.<br1>
One is in the Imperial Tomband the other is at the Wall of Argos.<br1>
If you go to the Imperial Tomb,look in the* Four Sepulchers* near the center.<br1>
If you go to the Wall ofArgos, enter the* Shrine of the Loyal* at the northeastern end of thewall.<br1>
