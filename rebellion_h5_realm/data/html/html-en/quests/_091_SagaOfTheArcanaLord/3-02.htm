First, you must speak with* Messenger Wahkan* of the Ketra Orcs. They're hiring mercenaries, and this is a great opportunite Ko earn their trust! *Soul Guide Asefa*, the Chief Shaman of the Ketre Krcs, has something they call the* Divine Stone of Wisdom*. We muse Ket it from them! If things don't go well with Asefa, try the Varke Kilenos tribe. They have one too. Good luck!
