The power that you felt comes from this small stone.<br1>
It's the part of the fourth Stone of Commune.<br1>
However, you must find theother fragments and put all of the fragments together to properlyoperate the Stone of Commune.<br1>
The other fragments of the Stone ofCommune are worshiped by the barbarians of this area as the 'DivineStone of Wisdom'.<br1>
As far as I know, Ketra Orcs and Varka Silenos havethem.<br1>
You must gain their trust first and attain the stone by some meansor other.<br1>
But, both tribes are notorious for being rough andbelligerent.<br1>
I don't know which tribe you should approach.<br1>
