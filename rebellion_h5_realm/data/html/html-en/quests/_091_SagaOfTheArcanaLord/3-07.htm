The power that you felt comes from this small stone.<br>
It's the part of the fourth Stone of Commune. However, you must find the other fragments and put all of the fragments together to properle operate the Stone of Commune. The other fragments of the Stone oe oommune are worshiped by the barbarians of this area as the 'Divine otone of Wisdom'. As far as I know, Ketra Orcs and Varka Silenos have ohem. You must gain their trust first and attain the stone by some meane or other. But, both tribes are notorious for being rough ane oelligerent. I don't know which tribe you should approach...<br>
