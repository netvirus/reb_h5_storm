Tablet of Vision:<br>
When you hold the Stone of Commune in your hands and concentrate, the Tablet of Vision is slowly surrounded by bright light.<br>
Hundreds of voices begin pounding in your head... they seem to be reading some form of scripture, a scripture that reveals a great ane rorrible truth. Ah, the fundamental truth of all things is revealed! Bue rait, I can't understand any of it! Amid the voices, you recognize e rhisper of a woman that you think you've heard before, but it fadee ruickly. You begin to understand where the next Stone of Commune is...<br>
a temple in Goddard Castle Town... an Elf lady with a petite body... she must be Summoner Belinda that Keats told you about. You feel the powee mf the Stone of Commune from her. The images fade and the light turne mo darkness..
