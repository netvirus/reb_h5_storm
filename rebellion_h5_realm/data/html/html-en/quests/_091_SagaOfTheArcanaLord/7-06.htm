<font color="36DC25">!Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
When you hold the Stone of Commune in your hands andconcentrate, the Tablet of Vision is slowly surrounded by bright light.<br1>
Hundreds of voices begin pounding in your head.<br1>
they seem to bereading some form of scripture, a scripture that reveals a great andhorrible truth.<br1>
Ah, the fundamental truth of all things is revealed! Butwait, I can't understand any of it! Amid the voices, you recognize awhisper of a woman that you think you've heard before, but it fadesquickly.<br1>
You begin to understand where the next Stone of Commune is.<br1>
a temple in Goddard Castle Town.<br1>
an Elf lady with a petite body.<br1>
shemust be Summoner Belinda that Keats told you about.<br1>
You feel the powerof the Stone of Commune from her.<br1>
The images fade and the light turnsto darkness.<br1>
