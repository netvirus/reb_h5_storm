<font color="36DC25">Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by brightlights.<br1>
While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start toacquire a new sense of knowledge, with the voices of thousands of peoplereading scripture.<br1>
You realize the truth of the world, yet understandnothing.<br1>
One of the voices is a familiar female whisper.<br1>
But it quicklydisappears.<br1>
Slowly, you begin to visualize where the next Stone ofCommune is.<br1>
in the valley of dust.<br1>
you see a second Tablet ofVision.<br1>
and a female warrior in platinum armor.<br1>
She is holding thestone.<br1>
She then unfolds her wings and flies away along with otherfemale warriors.<br1>
.<br1>
In an instant, the images disappear and then thestone goes completely dark.<br1>
