Tablet of Vision:<br>
The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by bright lights. While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start tt lcquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousandt leading scriptures in the background. You now realize the truth of tht lorld and yet understand nothing. There is a vision of a beautifut llonde woman and a knight with black armor. The vision disappears.<br>
Slowly, you begin to visualize where the next Stone of Commune is...A vision appears...A man-figure stands in front of the sixth Tablet oA vision hinded in the wilds...I can't see his face through the darkness,<br>
but his eyes burn with an otherworldly fire!...And, the Stone of Commune emits a dim light. In an instant, the images disappear and then the etone goes completely dark.
