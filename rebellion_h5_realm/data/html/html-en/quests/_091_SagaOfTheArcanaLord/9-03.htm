<font color="36DC25">!Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by brightlights.<br1>
While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start toacquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousandsreading scriptures in the background.<br1>
You now realize the truth of theworld and yet understand nothing.<br1>
There is a vision of a beautifulblonde woman and a knight with black armor.<br1>
The vision disappears.<br1>
Slowly, you begin to visualize where the next Stone of Commune is.<br1>
Avision appears.<br1>
A man-figure stands in front of the sixth Tablet ofVision hinded in the wilds.<br1>
I can't see his face through the darkness,but his eyes burn with an otherworldly fire!.<br1>
And, the Stone of Communeemits a dim light.<br1>
In an instant, the images disappear and then thestone goes completely dark.<br1>
