I need some *enchanted iron*.<br1>
It's made byapplying magic to iron ore.<br1>
There aren't any Mystic around, so we'llhave to improvise.<br1>
A creature known as the *enchanted iron golem* canbe found in the vicinity of the Ivory Tower.<br1>
Peel off some of its scrapand bring it to me! I'll need about *five* pieces.<br1>
These golems arequite durable, and won't peel away easily.<br1>
