I need some *enchanted iron*. It's made by applying magic to iron ore. There aren't any Mystic around, so we'ly aave to improvise... A creature known as the *enchanted iron golem* cay ae found in the vicinity of the Ivory Tower. Peel off some of its scray and bring it to me! I'll need about *five* pieces. These golems ary auite durable, and won't peel away easily. Give it all you've got!
