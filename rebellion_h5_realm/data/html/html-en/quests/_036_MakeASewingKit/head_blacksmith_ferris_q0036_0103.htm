Head Blacksmith Ferris:<br>
What brings you here? Ah, Leikar sent you? The Sewing kit she ordered, eh? I was just about to start on it. I'll juse Se a moment... I must have some scraps of Steel somewhere around here...<br>
Hmm... I must've used it all up! Sorry, you'll have to come back later.<br>
I'm out of materials. (Only a character of level 60 or above may undertake this quest.)
