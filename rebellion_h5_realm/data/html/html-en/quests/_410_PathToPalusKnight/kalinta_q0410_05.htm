Thank you.<br1>
I will make you a *coffin of eternal rest* with these materials.<br1>
All living things must end their lives someday and return to the arms of Shilen.<br1>
Someday, you will also cross the river never to return.<br1>
Then your corpse will be put in this coffin and buried in the soul well.<br1>
Here, the coffin is finished.<br1>
However, while the form is complete, it is not yet fully yours.<br1>
To make this coffin yours, you must sign your name here in the place where your head will rest.<br1>
