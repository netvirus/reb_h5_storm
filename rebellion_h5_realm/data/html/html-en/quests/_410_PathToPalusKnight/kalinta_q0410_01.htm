I welcome you in the name of Shilen, child of darkness.<br1>
So you are a Palus Knight in training who received the *Trial of the RedCoffin* from Master Virgil.<br1>
To complete the trial, you must make your own *coffin of eternal rest*.<br1>
This is not the crude wooden coffin, made by humans to bury their corpses in the backyard of their temples.<br1>
This is a traditional Dark Elf coffin made with the carapace of a beast and the silk threads of a spider.<br1>
The materials needed to make this coffinare all very rare, and the process of searching for the materials it self is a part of the trial.<br1>
Therefore, you must find the materials yourself.<br1>
