You must have exactly *13* skulls to complete the ritual.<br1>
Thirteen is a holy number to we Dark Elves that follow Shilen,for it symbolizes death and rebirth.<br1>
Go back to the Neutral Zone and strike down the lycanthropes .<br1>
Come back when you have 13 skulls.<br1>
Only then can the ritual be completed.<br1>
