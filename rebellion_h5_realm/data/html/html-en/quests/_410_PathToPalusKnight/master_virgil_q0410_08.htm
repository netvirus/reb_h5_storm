You must have exactly *13* skulls to complete theritual.<br1>
Thirteen is a holy number to we Dark Elves that follow Shilen,for it symbolizes death and rebirth.<br1>
Go back to the Neutral Zone andstrike down the lycanthropes .<br1>
Come back when you have 13 skulls.<br1>
Onlythen can the ritual be completed.<br1>
