Now you are the true owner of this *coffin of eternal rest*.<br1>
The last part of the trial is to carry this coffin and go back to theone who first gave you the trial.<br1>
Go to *Master Virgil in Gludio CastleTown* and give him your coffin.<br1>
I hope you will safely complete yourtrial and be reborn as a Knight of the deep lake.<br1>
May the protection ofShilen be with you.<br1>
