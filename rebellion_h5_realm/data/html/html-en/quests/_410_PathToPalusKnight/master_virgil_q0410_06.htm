Before you receive the trial, take this talisman.<br1>
Those who follow Shilen will see it and know that you are a fighter performinga task.<br1>
The first trial is the *ritual of 13 skulls.<br1>
* Its object is to collect 13 enemy skulls killed by your own hand.<br1>
It is a ritual to meditate upon the death that the Knight brings with his sword.<br1>
Throw out all private emotions and perform the task with a solemn heart.<br1>
Do notforget that Shilen will be watching over your path.<br1>
I will tell youabout the enemy you must kill in this ritual.<br1>
If you travel on the road that heads north of the village, you will come to the *Neutral Zone.<br1>
* Itis an area where combat is forbidden, according to agreement, because itis the boundary area between the two Elven tribes.<br1>
There are creatures gathering their strength in the Neutral Zone, and taking advantage of the situation because Elven soldiers cannot enter.<br1>
These creatures arethe *lycanthrope* -- half-Human, half-animal.<br1>
They are slowly getting stronger in the Neutral Zone, and are even setting their sights on theElves' home.<br1>
*Dispose of these lycanthropes in the name of Shilen, and collect exactly 13 of their skulls and bring them to me.<br1>
* This is the end of my explanation.<br1>
Now you should go.<br>
