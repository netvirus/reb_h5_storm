You need your own coffin to perform the second trial,the *Ritual of the Red Coffin*.<br1>
Yes, I'm speaking of the coffin you useto bury an elf when he dies.<br1>
According to the funeral customs of theDark Elves, we need a traditional coffin made from the carapace of abeast.<br1>
You must make this yourself.<br1>
You should ask *Abyssal CelebrantKalinta* how to make a coffin.<br1>
You can meet her if you go to the *DarkElven Guild of the village of Gludin*.<br1>
You must take this letter withyou.<br1>
