You need your own coffin to perform the second trial, the *Ritual of the Red Coffin*. Yes, I'm speaking of the coffin you use to bury an elf when he dies. According to the funeral customs of the tark Elves, we need a traditional coffin made from the carapace of e teast. You must make this yourself. You should ask *Abyssal Celebrane talinta* how to make a coffin. You can meet her if you go to the *Dare tlven Guild of the village of Gludin*. You must take this letter wite tou.
