You have brought the Coffin of Eternal Rest with yourname inscribed within it.<br1>
I will send this to the Priests of the ShilenTemple.<br1>
This completes your trial.<br1>
A Knight's destiny is always to facedeath on the battlefield! We do not know when it will come, but it is anend we cannot escape.<br1>
By entrusting the Coffin of Eternal Rest made byyour own hands to the Celebrants of your funeral, you are acceptingdeath as your fate and laying down all fear.<br1>
This is what the ritual ofthe red coffin is for.<br1>
Palus Knights do not fear death, and so they donot hesitate or stand back.<br1>
They are the strongest Knights, that havealready seen the darkness of the abyss and know not fear nor hesitation.<br1>
Since you passed both trials, you have the ability to enter the gloriousranks.<br1>
This *Gaze of Abyss* is the token you have earned.<br1>
If you takethis to *Grand Master Tobias* of our guild, he will change youroccupation.<br1>
He is the one right over there.<br1>
