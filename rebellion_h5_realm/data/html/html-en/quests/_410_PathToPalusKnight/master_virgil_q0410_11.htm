You have brought the Coffin of Eternal Rest with your name inscribed within it.<br1>
I will send this to the Priests of the Shilen Temple.<br1>
This completes your trial.<br1>
A Knight's destiny is always to face death on the battlefield! We do not know when it will come, but it is anend we cannot escape.<br1>
By entrusting the Coffin of Eternal Rest made byyour own hands to the Celebrants of your funeral, you are accepting death as your fate and laying down all fear.<br1>
This is what the ritual of the red coffin is for.<br1>
Palus Knights do not fear death, and so they donot hesitate or stand back.<br1>
They are the strongest Knights, that have already seen the darkness of the abyss and know not fear nor hesitation.<br1>
Since you passed both trials, you have the ability to enter the glorious ranks.<br1>
This *Gaze of Abyss* is the token you have earned.<br1>
If you take this to *Grand Master Tobias* of our guild, he will change your occupation.<br1>
He is the one right over there.<br1>
