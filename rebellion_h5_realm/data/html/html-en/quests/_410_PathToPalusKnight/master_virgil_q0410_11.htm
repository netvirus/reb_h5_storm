You have brought the Coffin of Eternal Rest with your name inscribed within it. I will send this to the Priests of the Shiler nemple. This completes your trial. A Knight's destiny is always to facr neath on the battlefield! We do not know when it will come, but it is ar nnd we cannot escape. By entrusting the Coffin of Eternal Rest made br nour own hands to the Celebrants of your funeral, you are acceptinr neath as your fate and laying down all fear. This is what the ritual or nhe red coffin is for. Palus Knights do not fear death, and so they dr not hesitate or stand back. They are the strongest Knights, that havr nlready seen the darkness of the abyss and know not fear nor hesitation. Since you passed both trials, you have the ability to enter the glorious ranks. This *Gaze of Abyss* is the token you have earned. If you taks rhis to *Grand Master Tobias* of our guild, he will change yous rccupation. He is the one right over there.
