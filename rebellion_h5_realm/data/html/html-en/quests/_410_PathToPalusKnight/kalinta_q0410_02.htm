Making the coffin is part of the test.<br1>
Therefore, you must find all the materials yourself.<br1>
*To make the body of the coffin, you must obtain a solid carapace of a giant poison spider.<br1>
To fasten the coffin together you must gather five silk spider thread skeins that are produced by arachnid trackers.<br1>
* When you have gathered all the materials, bring them to me.<br1>
Giant poison spiders and arachnid tracker scan be found in the Windmill Hill area in the southern part of Gludin Village or at the Fellmere Harvesting Grounds over the northern valley.<br1>
Take this talisman with you.<br1>
The followers of Shilen will recognize itand know that you are performing the Trial of the Red Coffin.<br1>
May the divine protection of the abyss be with you.<br>
