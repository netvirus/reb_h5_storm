Thank you.<br1>
Thirteen skulls brought from dealing with the enemy of your race .<br1>
They are the result of death brought about from your own hands.<br1>
Knights of other races embellish their actions an dduties by saying that they are "guarding justice" or "protecting thecommon people.<br1>
" However, the knights of the dark do not forget the essence of knighthood through hiding behind fancy words or moral obligations.<br1>
A knight is one that brings death.<br1>
The victory he achieveswith his sword has the same meaning as death to his opponent .<br1>
Nomatter what the goal or motive, all combat between knights ends in death.<br1>
Just because you shout "honor" or "justice" doesn't change the meaning of your opponent's death.<br1>
Death is death.<br1>
You have stolen your opponent's opportunity to live.<br1>
Do not forget the fact that you are the"one who brings death.<br1>
