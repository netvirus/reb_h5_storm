Thank you.<br1>
Thirteen skulls brought from dealing with theenemy of your race .<br1>
They are the result of death brought about fromyour own hands.<br1>
Knights of other races embellish their actions andduties by saying that they are "guarding justice" or "protecting thecommon people.<br1>
" However, the knights of the dark do not forget theessence of knighthood through hiding behind fancy words or moralobligations.<br1>
A knight is one that brings death.<br1>
The victory he achieveswith his sword has the same meaning as death to his opponent .<br1>
Nomatter what the goal or motive, all combat between knights ends indeath.<br1>
Just because you shout "honor" or "justice" doesn't change themeaning of your opponent's death.<br1>
Death is death.<br1>
You have stolen youropponent's opportunity to live.<br1>
Do not forget the fact that you are the"one who brings death.<br1>
