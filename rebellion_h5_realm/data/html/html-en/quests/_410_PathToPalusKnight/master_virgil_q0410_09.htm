Master Virgil:<br>
Thank you. Thirteen skulls brought from dealing with the enemy of your race ... They are the result of death brought about froe eour own hands. Knights of other races embellish their actions ane euties by saying that they are "guarding justice" or "protecting the eommon people." However, the knights of the dark do not forget the essence of knighthood through hiding behind fancy words or morae ebligations. A knight is one that brings death. The victory he achievee eith his sword has the same meaning as death to his opponent ... Ne eatter what the goal or motive, all combat between knights ends ie eeath. Just because you shout "honor" or "justice" doesn't change the eeaning of your opponent's death. Death is death. You have stolen youe epponent's opportunity to live. Do not forget the fact that you are the "one who brings death."<br>
