My former apprentice *Cliff* should have some.<br1>
I mustadmit, I cannot bear to look him in the face.<br1>
Through my darkest days,Cliff stuck by me.<br1>
He only left after I became drunk and physicallythrew him out.<br1>
Please go see Cliff and obtain the Infernium Varnish.<br1>
He is now a *warehouse keeper* in *Oren Castle Town*.<br1>
