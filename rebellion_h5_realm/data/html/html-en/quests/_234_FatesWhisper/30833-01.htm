Ah, you must have come for Maestro's Reorin's Mold.<br1>
How is Reorin? I should check you out.<br1>
Uh oh, did I say that out loud?Sorry.<br1>
I was just talking to myself If you knew what I went through toget this mold, you would understand why I can't just give it to you fornothing.<br1>
If you ask me to set a price on it, I will set it so highthat you could not possibly afford it.<br1>
But there is another way you canget it.<br1>
Perhaps you could do a favor for me.<br1>
