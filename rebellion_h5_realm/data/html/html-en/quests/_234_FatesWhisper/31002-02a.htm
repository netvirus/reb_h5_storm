<font color="FF8000">Maestro Reorin:</font><br>
I thought I had told you that already! I foolishlybroke the guild's taboo and had dealings with a demon.<br1>
My desire tocreate a masterpiece has been my ruin! However, I cannot turn back thehands of time.<br1>
My honor has been destroyed and all of my apprenticeshave abandoned me.<br1>
My pride is long-gone.<br1>
Now I am reduced to workingfor the favor of those filthy demons.<br1>
I have earned my new nickname,blacksmith of demons.<br1>
Now all I live for is the drink.<br1>
Liquor is myonly friend.<br1>
