My rivals stole it from me when I was expelled from theguild! Instead of defending me, they helped themselves to my materialsand tools! Thankfully, I was able to hide away my work journal.<br1>
I haveheard that the *Head Blacksmith Ferris* in *Aden Castle Town* has myhammer.<br1>
At one time he was one of my apprentices.<br1>
When I had my problemswith the guild, he turned on me like a bad dog.<br1>
I cannot bear to seehim.<br1>
Please go and get my hammer from him.<br1>
