That is all very hazy to me.<br1>
I was sitting on my frontporch, drunk as usual, and she appeared.<br1>
She was accompanied by a blackknight.<br1>
Although I shall never forget that day, I cannot tell you muchabout their appearance.<br1>
Now it seems like it was a dream.<br1>
I doremember that she had an other-wordly beauty, with blonde hair and blueeyes.<br1>
The knight was quite old, with gray hair and a dark countenance.<br1>
Other than that.<br1>
I cannot say.<br1>
