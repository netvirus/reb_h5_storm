We hope to collect *Baium's blood* from the Tower ofInsolence.<br1>
Surely you have heard of how Baium was descended from KingShunaiman, who received the blessing of Einhasad in person! We mustobtain the accursed royal blood from his veins.<br1>
Take this *pipet knife*and cut Baium.<br1>
Once the knife absorbs his blood and turns red, bring itto me.<br1>
Although others have succeeded in infiltrating the towerrecently, your task will not be easy.<br1>
Go now and talk to *MagisterHanellin of Aden Castle Town*.<br1>
