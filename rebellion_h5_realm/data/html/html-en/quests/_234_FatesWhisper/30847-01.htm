Do you know Reorin? Then I suppose you've heardthe news of his pardon! He's been reinstated as a regular guildsman! Inthe nick of time if you ask me.<br1>
The guild could not afford to lose amaestro such as him.<br1>
What's that? You are here for the *Hammer ofMaestro Reorin*? Yes! It was seized when the maestro was expelled fromthe guild.<br1>
Now take it back to him.<br1>
Please congratulate him for me andtell him that I am looking forward to seeing the results of his newproject.<br1>
