<font color="36DC25">Maestro Reorin:</font><br>
Those wicked demons forced me to make an *inferniumscepter*.<br1>
Infernium is a very rare element, seldom seen since the timeof the Titans.<br1>
They told me that I should be honored to be working withsuch a precious material.<br1>
I must admit that this thought appealed to me,and I quickly set about creating the scepters for them.<br1>
Now it is clearwhat I must do.<br1>
I must recover the three scepters and melt them away sothat they cannot be used by the demons.<br1>
This will restore my honor! Todo this, I will have to confront *Death Lord Hallate and his minions*! Iwill not be successful without your help.<br1>
