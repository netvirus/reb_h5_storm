Is it true? Have you really slain Death Lord Hallateand his underlings? Indeed, the mysterious woman was telling thetruth.<br1>
Yes, the infernium scepters.<br1>
My greatest masterpiece and thekey to my downfall.<br1>
Now, I will gladly destroy them and create an evenmore powerful weapon for you! Do you smell that? It's the infernium.<br1>
Smells like Sulfur, doesn't it? That's why the demons are so fond of it.<br1>
An amazing material, really.<br1>
Tougher and lighter than mithril, it is oneof the finest materials you will find.<br1>
It can be used to make Grade Aweapon that you will find most useful.<br1>
Refining this material can betricky, however.<br1>
I will need some *Infernium Varnish*.<br1>
It is quite rare.<br1>
