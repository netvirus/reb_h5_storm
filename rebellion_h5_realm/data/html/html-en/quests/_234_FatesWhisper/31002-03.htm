But markmy words, if the soul of my wife suffers any torment, I will hold youpersonally responsible! Now listen carefully.<br1>

This demon keeps the souls in this world,never allowing them to cross into eternal rest.<br1>
Some time ago, the soulof my wife was added to his collection! He can be found in *theCemetery* in Aden.<br1>
Please free my wife's soul from this wickeddemon.<br1>
