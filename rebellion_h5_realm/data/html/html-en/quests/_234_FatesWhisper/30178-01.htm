Maestro Reorin's Mold? Yes, I bought it from him a yearago.<br1>
I got a great deal on it.<br1>
Actually, since it was a tool used bysuch a famous artisan, I was ready to pay considerably more for it.<br1>
WhenI saw how cheaply he had it priced, I snatched it right up.<br1>
As soon as Igave him the adena Maestro Reorin ran to a liquor store.<br1>
I hated to seehim like that He was so well-respected at one time.<br1>
