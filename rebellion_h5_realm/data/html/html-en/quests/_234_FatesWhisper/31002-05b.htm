Ah, yes, *Death Lord Hallate*.<br1>
He leads the army ofdarkness.<br1>
He is also known as the insolent invader and the archenemy ofthe angels.<br1>
He plans to invade the Tower of Insolence and steal theancient treasure that is on its highest floor.<br1>
*Longhorn GeneralGolconda* and *Kernon* are assisting him.<br1>
All three of these demons arecarrying infernium scepters! Legend says that angels protected the towerwith a powerful force field, shielding it from all with evil intent.<br1>
However, using the scepter I made for him, Hallate has breached theshield.<br1>
To think of the hours I spent toiling over that scepter, puttingmy heart and soul into it, and now it's come to this.<br1>
