Oh! You're the one who explored the Tower of Insolenceon behalf of Reorin! Hardin's Academy is not your ordinary place oflearning.<br1>
It constantly monitors world affairs.<br1>
Recently there have beeninteresting developments around the Tower of Insolence.<br1>
Even now, forcesare gathering to fight over ancient relics that are supposedly hidden inthe tower.<br1>
Of course, our interests are different from theirs.<br1>
We hopeto collect *Baium's blood* from the Tower of Insolence.<br1>
Surely you haveheard of how Baium was descended from King Shunaiman, who received theblessing of Einhasad in person! We must obtain the accursed royal bloodfrom his veins.<br1>
But.<br1>
No.<br1>
This is extremely hard.<br1>
You are too weak todo this.<br1>
Just bring us 30 Fabric, blooded in the Baium's guardiansblood.<br1>
They will be passes to the Baium.<br1>
Meet Hanellin in the Aden Townto obtain more information.<br1>
