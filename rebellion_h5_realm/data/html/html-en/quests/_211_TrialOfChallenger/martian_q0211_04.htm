So, you have killed Gorr? Congratulations! Unfortunately, justnow the villagers of Floran were attacked again by another evilcreature.<br1>
This time the creature is called *'Baraham'*.<br1>
Perhaps he cameto avenge the death of Gorr.<br1>
Anyway, *you should search the othercaves near Gorr's shelter.<br1>
