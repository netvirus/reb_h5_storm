What am I to do? What if the shield is really destroyed?Arrgh! I can't even think about it! Hmm, must stay calm.<br1>
If someonewanted to destroy the shield.<br1>
Where would they go? Ah-Hah!! There isonly one place I know of! *The deepest parts of the Mithril Mines*,where the Earth Worm was slain and its blood spilled! The shield is mostvulnerable in places where evil is rampant.<br1>
