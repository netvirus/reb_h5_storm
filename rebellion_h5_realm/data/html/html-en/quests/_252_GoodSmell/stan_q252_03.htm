As I expected, they're cooking the dish over theircampfires.<br1>
The soup will soon be mine! Search their pockets for therecipe.<br1>
I think the<font color="LEVEL">Sel Mahum Squad Leaders</font>might keep it with them.<br1>
They tend to hang around the campfires gobblingup soup.<br1>
The<font color="LEVEL">Sel Mahum Chef</font>is another possibility.<br1>
He carries around the soup and serves it to thesquad leaders.<br1>
I can taste victory already.<br1>
it will be ours and sowill the soup! Some of the Sel Mahum Squad Leaders doze off around thefires, careful not to wake them.<br1>
I'll wait right here.<br1>
