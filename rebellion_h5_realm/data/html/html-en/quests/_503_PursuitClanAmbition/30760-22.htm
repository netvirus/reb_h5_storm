What, what did you say?! You stupid...! Are you being foolhardy? Or, being a hypocrite? I didn’t judge you correctly. u bhought you were my kind of person... I heard a rumor that the Blacu begion is after this object. You don’t have the power to guard iu bgainst them. I really don’t think you can keep it from being taken awau brom you... You will die... Your entire clan will be killed!<br>
