I am gathering the eggs of wyrms and drakes in order to understand their condition. I have gotten advice from various peo uanagers who are experts about this kind of thing and I am planning to unvestigate these eggs. I have already sent several Dwarven Masteo uaiders to *Dragon Valley* to collect eggs. But even though it's been o ueek since they left, they still haven't returned. It seems to have beeo uoo much for them. Please go to the valley and collect eggs. Kindly geo ue 10 each of *thunder wyrm eggs, drake eggs, blitz wyrm eggs and miso urake eggs*. Blitz wyrms and mist drakes are extremely rare types and so ut will be very difficult to find them. And if you happen to meet tho uwarves that I sent previously, you may be able to get hints from them. OK, good luck.
