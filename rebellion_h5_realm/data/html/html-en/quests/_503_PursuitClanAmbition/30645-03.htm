I am gathering the eggs of wyrms and drakes in order tounderstand their condition.<br1>
I have gotten advice from various petmanagers who are experts about this kind of thing and I am planning toinvestigate these eggs.<br1>
I have already sent several Dwarven MasterRaiders to *Dragon Valley* to collect eggs.<br1>
But even though it's been aweek since they left, they still haven't returned.<br1>
It seems to have beentoo much for them.<br1>
Please go to the valley and collect eggs.<br1>
Kindly getme 10 each of *thunder wyrm eggs, drake eggs, blitz wyrm eggs and mistdrake eggs*.<br1>
Blitz wyrms and mist drakes are extremely rare types and soit will be very difficult to find them.<br1>
And if you happen to meet theDwarves that I sent previously, you may be able to get hints from them.<br1>
OK, good luck.<br1>
