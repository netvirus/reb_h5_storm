<font color="FF8000">Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:</font><br>
The royal authority at the center has already been shaken to the core.<br1>
And the authority of lords and aristocrats hasfallen a long time ago.<br1>
The bloody uprising of peasants that broke out afew years ago in Dion is the proof.<br1>
In the midst of this chaos, severalsmall power circles in every part of the country are growing their ownstrength trying to grasp a big piece of the piefor themselves.<br1>
I believethat a young and energetic lord like yourself should lead in a new era.<br1>
If your clan can distinguish itself a little more, I can join forceswith you and support you.<br1>
