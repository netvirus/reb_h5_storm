<font color="36DC25">Sir Eric Rodemai:</font><br>
I heard about you from Gustaf Athebaldt.<br1>
I'm honoredto get to work with you.<br1>
Actually my father Sir Kristof Rodemai oftentalks about you.<br1>
He told me that since you are the people who willachieve some great mission I should watch you with close attention.<br1>
Iwould like to meet your clan lord as soon as possible.<br1>
Because of thepromise our ancestors had made in the past - I will tell you about itlater -- We, the Rodemai family have worked for the Athebaldt family forthe past three generations.<br1>
This time, we have been ordered to recoverthe Scepter of Judgment, relic of the ancient kingdom, which mayactually be a mere legend, and we are inquiring into rumors about itswhereabouts from everywhere.<br1>
