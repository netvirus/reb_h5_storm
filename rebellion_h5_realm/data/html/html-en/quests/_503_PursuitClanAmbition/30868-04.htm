One cannot guess the ages of these three women.<br1>
Theyalways disappear after leaving some incomprehensible strange remarks.<br1>
Everybody calls them witches.<br1>
My father has been strangely obsessed bytheir remarks.<br1>
When you were young, did our family prosper afterfollowing advice from witches? I donâ€™t know the details of whathappened.<br1>
Honestly, I don't want to have anything to do with suchblasphemous people.<br1>
Would you be willing to go see them on behalf of me?I heard that *Clio*, the youngest of the three sisters is near thisvillage.<br1>
If you go to the Eastern part of the village and cross abridge, you will be able to meet her.<br1>
