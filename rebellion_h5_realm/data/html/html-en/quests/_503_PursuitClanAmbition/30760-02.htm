<font color="36DC25">!Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:</font><br>
The royal authority at the center has alreadybeen shaken to the core.<br1>
And the authority of lords and aristocrats hasfallen a long time ago.<br1>
The bloody uprising of peasants that broke out afew years ago in Dion is the proof.<br1>
In the midst of this chaos, severalsmall power circles are growing their strength trying to grasp a bigpiece of the pie for themselves.<br1>
I believe that a young and energeticlord like yourself should lead in a new era.<br1>
And I would like to lend mypower to people like you and your clan.<br1>
Although you are already welltrusted by so many people that I guess you won’t need my backing thatmuch.<br1>
