Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:<br>
The royal authority at the center has already been shaken to the core. And the authority of lords and aristocrats hay ballen a long time ago.The bloody uprising of peasants that broke out y bew years ago in Dion is the proof. In the midst of this chaos, severay bmall power circles are growing their strength trying to grasp a biy biece of the pie for themselves. I believe that a young and energetiy bord like yourself should lead in a new era. And I would like to lend my bower to people like you and your clan. Although you are already wely brusted by so many people that I guess you wonâ€™t need my backing thay buch... (Only level 4 clan can carry out this quest.)<br>
