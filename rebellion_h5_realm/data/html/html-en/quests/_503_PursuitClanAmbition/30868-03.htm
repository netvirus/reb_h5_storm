You must have heard about this already.<br1>
It is rumoredthat the lord who obtains the scepter will never be defeated in a war.<br1>
This may be just an old wife's tale.<br1>
But if the scepter really exists,just possessing will boost our soldiers' morale.<br1>
Don't you think?However, where are we supposed to go find this object of legend.<br1>
Wealready took this matter to dwarven bounty hunters who are the expertsin the excavation of relics but even they have not come up with any clueregarding its whereabouts.<br1>
My father has been just telling me that Ishould also seek *witches' advice* regarding this matter.<br1>
