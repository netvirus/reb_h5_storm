<font color="FF8000">Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:</font><br>
From looking at your face, I can tell that youheard something about me from Sir Rodemai.<br1>
Please don't misunderstandme.<br1>
When King Rauhel was alive, I gave my full devotion to him.<br1>
And whenI expressed to you my concern over this country, I was at least halfwaytruthful.<br1>
However, I think that if I become a king, I will be able tosolve the problem this country is facing more quickly.<br1>
You can say thatit is my ambition and aspiration.<br1>
You want to hear about that old andbroken Scepter of Judgment? Humph.<br1>
All the stories about the scepter areof course superstitions.<br1>
However the stupid people and soldiers believethem.<br1>
By having the scepter, I can boost the morale of our soldiers andmake our enemy afraid of us! Thereby, I can establish an invinciblearmy.<br1>
How about you? I did take advantage of your clan for thispurpose.<br1>
But isn't it true that you also used me for your ownaspiration? From now on, you will often seek my help and receive it.<br1>
Yesit's also true that someday, we may follow different paths and end upfacing each other as enemies.<br1>
However, right at this moment, what is itthat you need the most? Here, look! I am holding it in my hand.<br1>
the*Proof of Aspiration*.<br1>
We are exchanging the things we need from eachother.<br1>
This is a wholesome trade.<br1>
