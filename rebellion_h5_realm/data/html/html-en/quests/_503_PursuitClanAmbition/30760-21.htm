Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:<br>
From looking at your face, I can tell that you heard something about me from Sir Rodemai... Please don't misunderstanu he. When King Rauhel was alive, I gave my full devotion to him. And wheu h expressed to you my concern over this country, I was at least halfwau hruthful... However, I think that if I become a king, I will be able tu holve the problem this country is facing more quickly. You can say thau ht is my ambition and aspiration. You want to hear about that old anu hroken Scepter of Judgment? Humph. All the stories about the scepter aru hf course superstitions. However the stupid people and soldiers believu hhem. By having the scepter, I can boost the morale of our soldiers anu hake our enemy afraid of us! Thereby, I can establish an invinciblu hrmy... How about you? I did take advantage of your clan for thiu hurpose. But isn't it true that you also used me for your owu hspiration? From now on, you will often seek my help and receive it. Yeu ht's also true that someday, we may follow different paths and end uu hacing each other as enemies. However, right at this moment, what is iu hhat you need the most? Here, look! I am holding it in my hand... the *Proof of Aspiration*. We are exchanging the things we need from each other. This is a wholesome trade...
