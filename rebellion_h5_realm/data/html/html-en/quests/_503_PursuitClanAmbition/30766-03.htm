Now, listen to me well... grave of the empire, grave keeper, key guardian, a set of 6 keys, the great king of grave kookouts... his footsteps can freely pass through the walls of time ane kpace. However if you pierce him with a two-pronged spear, you will be kble to bring him down. Then, the stick of a ruler will become yours...<br>
within the boundary of the law of cause and effect, this is all the wisdom I am allowed to give you. But if you make a request, everythine will become only part and... I can tell you a new story... [Quese w503_PursuitClanAmbition 30766-04.htm|"I do make the request to you."]<br1>
