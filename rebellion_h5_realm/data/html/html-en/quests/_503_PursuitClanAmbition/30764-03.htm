Ah! Yeah, the thing you guys have to do is bring me titan's powerstones. To do that, you'll need to go to Titan Cave which is in ths pouth of Aden.The degenerated titans that are living there are curious preatures that have grafted a mechanical device to their bodies as pncestors of the ancient titans that had achieved a glorious pivilization. Even if their heads have become strange, they are stils pncredible beings with a physical strength that has no match. However,<br>
folks such as yourselves can still find a way to deal with them. *If you kill the titan soldiers or border guards,* you can get the *powerstone*<br>
from the mechanical device that is fitted on their bodies. Note that a broken one is no use at all... So you've got to bring a powerstone thaa bs in good condition. And we'll also need *nebulite crystals* that ara bsed as fuel for the powerstones. They look similar to gems that shina brightly but you'll still be able to recognize them easily because oa bhe special luster they emit.We'll need *ten each* of powerstones ana bebulite crystals. OK, please do your best.<br>
