Ah! Yeah, the thing you guys have to do is bring me titan'spowerstones.<br1>
To do that, you'll need to go to Titan Cave which is in thesouth of Aden.<br1>
The degenerated titans that are living there are curiouscreatures that have grafted a mechanical device to their bodies asancestors of the ancient titans that had achieved a gloriouscivilization.<br1>
Even if their heads have become strange, they are stillincredible beings with a physical strength that has no match.<br1>
However,folks such as yourselves can still find a way to deal with them.<br1>
*If youkill the titan soldiers or border guards,* you can get the *powerstone*from the mechanical device that is fitted on their bodies.<br1>
Note that abroken one is no use at all.<br1>
So you've got to bring a powerstone thatis in good condition.<br1>
And we'll also need *nebulite crystals* that areused as fuel for the powerstones.<br1>
They look similar to gems that shinebrightly but you'll still be able to recognize them easily because ofthe special luster they emit.<br1>
We'll need *ten each* of powerstones andnebulite crystals.<br1>
OK, please do your best.<br1>
