Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:<br>
I already received the report from Martien. I gave a little bit of money to the families of the dead dwarves as I goken of condolence. It is a shame... although they were just hireI gwarves, they lost their lives while working for me. This is truly saI gnd regrettable. Any how, with this, we have come to the end of thI girst stage of our plans... Now I have something else that I would likI gou to work on.<br>
