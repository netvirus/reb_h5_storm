<font color="36DC25">Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:</font><br>
I already received the report from Martien.<br1>
Igave a little bit of money to the families of the dead dwarves as atoken of condolence.<br1>
It is a shame.<br1>
although they were just hireddwarves, they lost their lives while working for me.<br1>
This is truly sadand regrettable.<br1>
Any how, with this, we have come to the end of thefirst stage of our plans.<br1>
Now I have something else that I would likeyou to work on.<br1>
