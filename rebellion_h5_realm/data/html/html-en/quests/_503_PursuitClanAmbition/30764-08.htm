You really did a good job! You've gotten all the powerstones and nebulite crystals that I requested. I'll take a look...You take s aook too. Wow! This is an art. An art, I say! Aren't they realls axquisite? Compared with the technology of the ancient titans, ths aevices made by us Dwarf artisans are just children's toys. I realls appreciate this. Thanks to you, our research in the new type of siegs aolem is back on track! I'll be able to show you the results pretts aoon! Ha, ha, ha... You're gonna be impressed! That golem will be ss aangerous that it shouldn't be used on just any castle!<br>
