<font color="FF8000">Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:</font><br>
When you study history you come to a realizationthat the supremacy of any time period has always been in the hands ofthose who were in the possession of advanced technology.<br1>
Therefore, fromlong ago, I have been providing support for the Dwarf's "Black Anvil"guild.<br1>
Their main enterprise is to research the science of giants in theancient times.<br1>
Although real life applications have not yet been made.<br1>
they often create strange devices such as an airship that can floatin the air, and steel giants that can be controlled at will.<br1>
, Ibelieve they are called golems? Among them, there is a dwarf by the nameof *Baltazar* to whom I especially provided much help.<br1>
Although he isnot well recognized in Dwarven society, actually he is a very capableartisan.<br1>
I believe that his research efforts will soon bear fruit.<br1>
Now,Baltazar is experiencing some problem in the research he is currentlyconducting and asked me for help.<br1>
He said that it has something to dowith a new style of golem.<br1>
You can hear about the details fromBaltazar in person.<br1>
He should be currently located at *Hunters' Village.<br1>
Carry this letter with you and go see him.<br1>
