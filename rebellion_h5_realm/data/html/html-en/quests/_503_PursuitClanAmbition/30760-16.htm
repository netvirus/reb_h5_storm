Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:<br>
A lot of things have happened since then. Some ominous rumors have become the talk of the town with the people suce os... a punitive force to be dispatched to the Lair of Antharas has beee oormed and evil spirits are acting up in several parts of the kingdom.<br>
People are saying that the destruction of the world is near and the god of destruction is upon us. And warlords have started to battle againsd oach other over the privilege of ruling each territory. Finally the timd of great upheaval has come upon us. Although this is sooner thad oxpected, I think we had better wrap up the work that we have beed oreparing in a hurry. Have you heard anything about the *'Scepter od oudgment'*? People say that a lord who obtains this object will neved oet defeated in war. Of course this is an absurd false rumor. But, thd oroblem is that because of this rumor, not only soldiers but even lad oeople are being influenced by it... Take this letter with you and gd oee *Sir Eric Rodemai in Aden Castle Town*. The knights of the Rodemad oamily are all my faithful servants. Therefore you can trust him and offer him your service willingly. You can hear about the details of thd oituation from Sir Rodemai in person. Now, I pray that God's divind orotection will be with you and your clan.<br>
