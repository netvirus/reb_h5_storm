<font color="36DC25">Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:</font><br>
A lot of things have happened since then.<br1>
Someominous rumors have become the talk of the town with the people suchas.<br1>
a punitive force to be dispatched to the Lair of Antharas has beenformed and evil spirits are acting up in several parts of the kingdom.<br1>
People are saying that the destruction of the world is near and the godof destruction is upon us.<br1>
And warlords have started to battle againsteach other over the privilege of ruling each territory.<br1>
Finally the timeof great upheaval has come upon us.<br1>
Although this is sooner thanexpected, I think we had better wrap up the work that we have beenpreparing in a hurry.<br1>
Have you heard anything about the *'Scepter ofJudgment'*? People say that a lord who obtains this object will neverget defeated in war.<br1>
Of course this is an absurd false rumor.<br1>
But, theproblem is that because of this rumor, not only soldiers but even laypeople are being influenced by it.<br1>
Take this letter with you and gosee *Sir Eric Rodemai in Aden Castle Town*.<br1>
The knights of the Rodemaifamily are all my faithful servants.<br1>
Therefore you can trust him andoffer him your service willingly.<br1>
You can hear about the details of thesituation from Sir Rodemai in person.<br1>
Now, I pray that God's divineprotection will be with you and your clan.<br1>
