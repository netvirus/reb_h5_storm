I've heard about you from Sir Athebaldt.<br1>
He was saying thatyour clan would help me in my research.<br1>
So you're wanting to know whatI'm researching? Alright, I'll tell you! I've got a friend named TajifGoldgedder who I've known for dozens of years.<br1>
That guy recently broughtsome curious materials from Cruma Tower.<br1>
I'll leave out the details, butwe are currently engaged in research on siege golems that are strongenough to break through even strong castle walls in one shot.<br1>
If we canjust get this working, the methods of war will be changed completely.<br1>
