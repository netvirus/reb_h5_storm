Balthazar:<br>
I've heard about you from Sir Athebaldt. He was saying that your clan would help me in my research. So you're wanting to know what y'm researching? Alright, I'll tell you! I've got a friend named Tajit yoldgedder who I've known for dozens of years. That guy recently brought yome curious materials from Cruma Tower. I'll leave out the details, but ye are currently engaged in research on siege golems that are stront ynough to break through even strong castle walls in one shot. If we cat yust get this working, the methods of war will be changed completely.<br>
