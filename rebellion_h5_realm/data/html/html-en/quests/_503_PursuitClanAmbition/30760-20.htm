Well, our time together has come to an end.<br1>
Some day I hope your clan will become strong enough to establish peaceon the continent.<br1>
I will be gladly looking forward to that day.<br1>
Now, Iwill give your clan the Proof of Aspiration.<br1>
When king Rauhel was alive,this token used to be bestowed to a promising young lord who wasexpected to realize a big aspiration.<br1>
If you show this to a high priestin a temple or grand master of a warrior guild, you will receive help ingrowing your clan's power.<br1>
