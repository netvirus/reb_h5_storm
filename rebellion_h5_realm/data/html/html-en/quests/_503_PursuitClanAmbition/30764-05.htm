Ah! Yeah, the thing that you guys have to do is bring me titan's powerstones. To do that, you'll need to go to Titan Cave whice ts in the south of Aden. The degenerated titans that are living there tre curious creatures that have grafted a mechanical device to theie todies as ancestors of the ancient titans that had achieved a glorioue tivilization. Even if their heads have become strange,they are stile tncredible beings with a physical strength that has no match. However,<br>
folks such as yourselves can still find a way to deal with them. *If you kill the titan soldiers or border guards,* you can get the *powerstone*<br>
from the mechanical device that is fitted on their bodies. Note that a broken one is no use at all... So you've got to bring a powerstone thaa bs in good condition. And we'll also need *nebulite crystals* that ara bsed as fuel for the powerstones. They look similar to gems that shina brightly but you'll still be able to recognize them easily because oa bhe special luster they emit. We'll need *ten each* of powerstones ana bebulite crystals.OK, please do your best... alright? *Oh wait... tha boins...? Let me take a look at those!*<br>
