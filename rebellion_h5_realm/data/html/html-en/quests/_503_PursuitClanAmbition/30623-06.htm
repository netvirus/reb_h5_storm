<font color="FF8000">Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:</font><br>
The royal authority at the center has alreadybeen shaken to the core.<br1>
And the authority of lords and aristocrats hasfallen a long time ago.<br1>
The bloody uprising of peasants that broke out afew years ago in Dion is the proof.<br1>
In the mids of this chaos, severalsmall power circles are growing their strength trying to grasp a bigpiece of the pie for themselves.<br1>
I believe that a young and energeticlord like yourself should lead in a new era.<br1>
Rather than counting on theold royal circle of influence, I would rather lend my power to new bloodlike you guys.<br1>
I'll be your strong supporter.<br1>
