Did you just say that all the Master Raiders died?! .<br1>
Oh, my!That's too bad but what can be done about it?.<br1>
I mean, they were guysthat lived by grave robbing and making their living off deeds likesmuggling relics from the past.<br1>
Doing that kind of work is alwaysdangerous and they must have been prepared for something like this tohappen someday.<br1>
Anyway, you've done a really good job.<br1>
I'll go ahead andtake all the eggs that you've brought.<br1>
