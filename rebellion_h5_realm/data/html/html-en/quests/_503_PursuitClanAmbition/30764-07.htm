As I've already said, we need *10 Titan Powerstones and 10Nebulite Crystals.<br1>
* The powerstones can be taken from the mechanicaldevices attached to the bodies of *Titan Soldiers and Border Guards*that you kill.<br1>
Go get some that aren't broken! And the nebulite crystalscan also be gotten from the titans.<br1>
They look like gemstones that shinebrightly but.<br1>
you'll be able to recognize them easily because of thespecial luster they emit.<br1>
