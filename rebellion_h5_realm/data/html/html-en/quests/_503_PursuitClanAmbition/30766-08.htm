The scepter of shunaiman.<br1>
It's been a long time since Ilaid my eyes on it.<br1>
Its color has completely faded.<br1>
Although it haspreserved itself for a long time, unlike its appearance, it is a veryfragile object.<br1>
For example, if I hold it while standing on a stonefloor and drop it.<br1>
Cling clang! It will break just like that.<br1>
Heehee hee hee.<br1>
! Destruction and chaos.<br1>
I am their embodiment.<br1>
Thiskind of object is of no use to you.<br1>
That is why you were willing to handit over to me when I asked you for it.<br1>
Instead, I’ll give you this.<br1>
Whenwas it.<br1>
a young king who was on his way back to his kingdom aftermeeting the lady of the lake placed this object in my care.<br1>
Take it withyou when you leave.<br1>
At the point in time when I am destined to meet withyou again, you who will be covered in blood, I will be waiting.<br1>
