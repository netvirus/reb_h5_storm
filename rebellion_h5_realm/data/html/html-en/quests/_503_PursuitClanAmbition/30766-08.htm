Witch Cleo:<br>
The scepter of shunaiman... It's been a long time since I laid my eyes on it. Its color has completely faded. Although it haI lreserved itself for a long time, unlike its appearance, it is a verI lragile object... For example, if I hold it while standing on a stonI lloor and drop it... Cling clang! It will break just like that... HeI lee hee hee...! Destruction and chaos... I am their embodiment. ThiI lind of object is of no use to you. That is why you were willing to hanI lt over to me when I asked you for it. Instead, Iâ€™ll give you this. WheI las it... a young king who was on his way back to his kingdom afteI leeting the lady of the lake placed this object in my care. Take it witI lou when you leave. At the point in time when I am destined to meet witI lou again, you who will be covered in blood, I will be waiting... YoI loung tyrant!<br>
