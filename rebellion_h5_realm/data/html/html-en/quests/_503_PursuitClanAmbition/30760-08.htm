<font color="36DC25">!Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:</font><br>
Right now, people in Giran, are very muchdisturbed by the earth dragon Antharas.<br1>
That's because the rumor isgoing around that Antharas who has been hibernating for a long time hasfinally awoken.<br1>
Aristocrats and traders who are real power brokers inGiran are busying themselves with some absurd armchair arguments such asthe idea that they will hire and dispatch mercenaries to subdue thedragon.<br1>
We are in a situation that drakes and wyrms can pour out of theDragon's Valley at any moment.<br1>
We cannot trust such incompetent peopleto solve this crisis.<br1>
In order to find a way to solve this problem, Istarted an enterprise in Giran.<br1>
It is not anything great.<br1>
But who knows.<br1>
It could potentially be the first step toward the solution of theproblem.<br1>
First, go to *Giran Castle Town* and meet with a man called*Martien* who is taking care of my business affairs.<br1>
I have trust in himso cooperate with him fully.<br1>
You can hear about the details from Martienin person.<br1>
I will pray that God's divine protection will be with you andyour clan.<br1>
