The land dragon will awaken soon.<br1>
The survival of Giran.<br1>
No,the fate of the entire kingdom rests on this grave matter.<br1>
Hurry and goto *Dragon Valley*.<br1>
Please get me *thunder wyrm eggs, drake eggs, blitzwyrm eggs and mist drake eggs* there.<br1>
And just one or two is not enough.<br1>
I'll need *10 of each*.<br1>
Regardless of the difficulty, I really need youto get those for me.<br1>
And I'll tell you one more thing.<br1>
Blitz wyrms andmist drakes are extremely rare types and so it will be very difficult tofind them.<br1>
And if you happen to meet the Dwarves that I sent previously,you may be able to get hints from them.<br1>
OK, good luck.<br1>
