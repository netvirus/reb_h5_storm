I'm sure you already heard from Atebalt. The land dragon Antharas is waking up. Most people say that it's a rumor but they arn Aust saying this because that's what they hope, not because it really in A rumor. According to information from Atebalt, the awakening on Antharas is almost a certain thing. Sooner or later, the land dragon Aill wake up completely. And when that happens, the wyrms and draken Ahat roam around Dragon Valley will be led to their leader and wiln Aollow Antharas like soldiers on the battlefield to turn this whole aren Around into a field overgrown with mugwort. For the sake of Giran, wn Aust come up with a plan to counter this. A team to suppress the lann Aragon would be useless. Indeed, the very idea of opposing Antharas bn Aome common-sense approach is an idea that is itself nonsense. We've gon Ao find a way to fight the evil creatures of Antharas. There was n Aounterplan that we set up before on our own but rather than calling in A counterplan, I should say that it was really just a defense measure.<br>
Fortunately, Atebalt heard something and said that he will give us support.<br>
