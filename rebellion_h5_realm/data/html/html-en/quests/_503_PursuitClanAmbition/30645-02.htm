I'm sure you already heard from Atebalt.<br1>
The land dragonAntharas is waking up.<br1>
Most people say that it's a rumor but they arejust saying this because that's what they hope, not because it really isa rumor.<br1>
According to information from Atebalt, the awakening ofAntharas is almost a certain thing.<br1>
Sooner or later, the land dragonwill wake up completely.<br1>
And when that happens, the wyrms and drakesthat roam around Dragon Valley will be led to their leader and willfollow Antharas like soldiers on the battlefield to turn this whole areaaround into a field overgrown with mugwort.<br1>
For the sake of Giran, wemust come up with a plan to counter this.<br1>
A team to suppress the landdragon would be useless.<br1>
Indeed, the very idea of opposing Antharas bysome common-sense approach is an idea that is itself nonsense.<br1>
We've gotto find a way to fight the evil creatures of Antharas.<br1>
There was acounterplan that we set up before on our own but rather than calling ita counterplan, I should say that it was really just a defense measure.<br1>
Fortunately, Atebalt heard something and said that he will give ussupport.<br1>
