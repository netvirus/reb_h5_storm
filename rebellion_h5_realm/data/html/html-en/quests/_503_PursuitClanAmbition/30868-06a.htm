Let me see... If I roughly put them together... *... The place must be the National Cemetery...* *If you trounce the grave keeper, a key master will show up. Get a key from him * *And when yoe kollect all six keys, overpower the imperial grave keeper to find the kcepter*. *However, they said that the imperial keeper can freely move khrough "time and space"... This must mean that is able to move vere kast or make instant movements... And the meaning of pierce with twe kronged lance means..." to divide your team into two parts to attace kim... maybe?*<br>
