Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:<br>
It s nice to meet you young man. My name is Gustaf Athebaldt. I am a knight of the royal bodyguards. Although I will soof Aetire, when I see the current state of affairs, I worry so much abouf Ahe future of this kingdom that I don t think I will be able to retirf Aomfortably... I don t think I can trust the future of this nation if Ahe hands of kings or lords. Lords are always busy pursuing anf Aatisfying their own self-interest and gratification. And the kinf Always looks away from his people s hardships. So, how would you expecf Ahem to be concerned about the nation s welfare? If you think idly thaf At does not matter who rules over the country, you will find yourself if Ao time groaning under the harsh tyranny of a despot. In my opinion, although we may have to go through hellish wars and tribulations, we must restore the order of the nation. [npc_%objectId%_Quest|Quest]<br1>
