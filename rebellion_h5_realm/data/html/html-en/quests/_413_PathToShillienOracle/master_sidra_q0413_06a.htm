In the beginning, Einhasad and Gran Kain sang the songof creation and created the world.<br1>
The songs of light sung by Einhasadand poems of darkness recited by Gran Kain formed a beautiful harmony tocreate all life in the universe.<br1>
Afterwards, they taught the songs theyhad sung to the earthly races that worshipped them, to enable them tocontrol light and darkness.<br1>
However, the giants were too greedy anddesired the gods' wisdom.<br1>
When they challenged their authority, Einhasadand Gran Kain punished the giants and the thousand songs that the giantswere taught were broken into runes.<br1>
Later, magicians began to collectthe ancient runes and rearrange them into spells, but their power isvery weak and insignificant compared to that of the ancient ancestorswho could sing the songs of creation learned directly from the gods.<br1>
