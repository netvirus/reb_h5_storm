<font color="36DC25">Priest Adonius:</font><br>
Welcome, child of the light.<br1>
The bone pieces of the departed souls that you have brought back will be given a proper funeral.<br1>
This completes your atonement.<br1>
Now you are ready to follow the path of light.<br1>
Take this.<br1>
It is *Andariel's book*, the book you were looking for.<br1>
It is a very precious book that contains parts of the song of creation sung by Einhasad, the god of light.<br1>
May you always meditateon the creed of light within.<br>
