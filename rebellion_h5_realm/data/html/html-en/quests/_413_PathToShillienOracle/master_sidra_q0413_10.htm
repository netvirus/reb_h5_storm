The two documents you hold in your hands contain parts of the song of creation sung by the Gods in the beginning.<br1>
I trust that you discovered the power of the precious phrases and the truth of authority as you read them one by one.<br1>
Now I am giving you the *Orb ofAbyss*.<br1>
With this, you have earned the qualification to become a Shillien Oracle.<br1>
Take the Orb of Abyss and go to a Grand Master to request a change of occupation.<br1>
If you speak to *Grand Master Tobias* over there, you can change profession right now.
