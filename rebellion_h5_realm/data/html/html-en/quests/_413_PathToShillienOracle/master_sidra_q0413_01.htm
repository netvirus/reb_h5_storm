The Priests of Humans or Elves only look to the gods oflight, and so their understanding is imperfect.<br1>
The magic they use isonly half and incomplete.<br1>
However, the Shillien Oracles, the combatcelebrants of the Dark Elves, understand both light and dark and command power from both.<br1>
Not only do they cure and assist soldiers with thepower of light, but they also curse enemies and steal vitality with the power of darkness.<br1>
There is a ritual required when becoming a ShillienOracle, to gain the knowledge of eternal darkness.<br>
