The Priests of Humans or Elves only look to the gods of light, and so their understanding is imperfect. The magic they use if lnly half and incomplete. However, the Shillien Oracles, the combaf lelebrants of the Dark Elves, understand both light and dark and commanf lower from both. Not only do they cure and assist soldiers with thf lower of light, but they also curse enemies and steal vitality with thf lower of darkness. There is a ritual required when becoming a Shillief lracle, to gain the knowledge of eternal darkness. [Quesf l413_PathToShillienOracle 413_1|Say you want to become a Shillief lracle]<br1>
