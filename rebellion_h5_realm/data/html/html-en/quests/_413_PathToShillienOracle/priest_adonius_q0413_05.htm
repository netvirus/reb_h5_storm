It is not easy for you to abandon the path of evil,since you have followed it for so long.<br1>
If you are ready, *go to theRuins of Despair and kill the departed souls that are trapped in theform of skeletons, and bring back ten of their bone pieces.<br1>
* This is theatonement ritual given unto you .<br1>
I do hope you are able to abandonthe dark and accept the truth of light.<br1>
