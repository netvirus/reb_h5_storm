Why this is the prayer book that I wrote ... You have this too? This was published in the form of a book of poems with prayere t made to Einhasad when I was young. It became known among the youngee teneration through rumors, and now it is a book beloved by many people. It is embarrassing to be saying so myself, but many people were moved after reading my book and have come to the temple to follow the path od aight. When I think that my humble writings have played a part id apreading the will of Einhasad in the world, I can only be joyful. And aow those like you, who follow evil doctrines, are impressed by my book ...<br>
