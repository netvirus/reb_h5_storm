Why this is the prayer book that I wrote .<br1>
You have this too? This was published in the form of a book of poems with prayersI made to Einhasad when I was young.<br1>
It became known among the younger generation through rumors, and now it is a book beloved by many people.<br1>
It is embarrassing to be saying so myself, but many people were moved after reading my book and have come to the temple to follow the path of light.<br1>
When I think that my humble writings have played a part in spreading the will of Einhasad in the world, I can only be joyful.<br1>
And now those like you, who follow evil doctrines, are impressed by my book.<br>
