May Shilen's blessing be with all those who search forthe truth of darkness.<br1>
I see you have brought back all five BloodyRunes.<br1>
I will combine these and write out Garmiel's Book for you.<br1>
It isonly a small section of the song of darkness that Gran Kain sang in thebeginning, but more will be revealed as your proficiency develops.<br1>
Nowtake this.<br1>
It is the completed Garmiel's Book.<br1>
Read its passages as yourest during your journey, and adapt the truth within as your own.<br1>
Nowyou must complete a second task in order to become a Shillien Oracle.<br1>
You must find *Andariel's Book,* which contains parts of the song ofcreation sung by the God of Light in the beginning.<br1>
Take this book to*Priest Adonius* in the temple of Einhasad.<br1>
He will receive youcordially when you say,<font color="F9AD81">'I have read your book and, being deeply	moved, I have repented of my sins and decided to accept the light.<br1>
