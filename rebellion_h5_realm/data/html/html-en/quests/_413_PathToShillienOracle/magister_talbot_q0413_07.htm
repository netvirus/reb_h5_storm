I see you have found Andariel's Book.<br1>
Did the lofty priests of Einhasad fall for it when you spoke of the books they hadwritten? They are hypocrites, who forget that the vanity and arrogance that they say are sins are within themselves.<br1>
*Now take Garmiel's Bookand Andariel's Book to Magister Sidra* of the village of Castle Gludio.<br1>
Then she will give you the Orb of Abyss, which is the token you need to change profession to Shillien Oracle.<br1>
