They were made in the image of a Goddess and are like angely wf beauty and wisdom. However, they were jealous of the power of thy wods and secretly eavesdropped on the songs Gran Kain sung in hiy walace, and wrote them down to use that power as their own. When Gray wain discovered this, he was furious and cast away the servants, saying, <font color="F9AD81">'I will not steal back the secrets that you have overheard. However, to know the secrets, you will have to spilu hlood.'</font> The documents that the dark succubi made of the Gods' songs disappeared, but instead, when they died, their blood formed runes to write out the lyrics of the songs that they had overheard at the palace of Gran Kain. *If you wish to complete Garmiel's book, you must collect the runes made by the blood of the dark succubus.* There are many dark succubi at the bpider Nest to the west of the Altar of Rites in the northern region. Kill them and find the Bloody Runes. Take these five blank sheets. If you put the scroll sheet near the blood, the blood will soak in and forf yunes. If you bring *five Bloody Runes*, I will put the runes togethef yo make you Garmiel's book.
