Have you ever heard of the demon *dark succubus?* Theywere servants that lived in the ancient palace of darkness and waited onGran Kain.<br1>
They were made in the image of a Goddess and are like angelsof beauty and wisdom.<br1>
However, they were jealous of the power of theGods and secretly eavesdropped on the songs Gran Kain sung in hispalace, and wrote them down to use that power as their own.<br1>
When GranKain discovered this, he was furious and cast away the servants, saying,<font color="F9AD81">'I will not steal back the secrets that you	have overheard.<br1>
However, to know the secrets, you will have to spill	blood.<br1>
'</font>The documents that the dark succubi made of the Gods' songs disappeared,but instead, when they died, their blood formed runes to write out thelyrics of the songs that they had overheard at the palace of Gran Kain.<br1>
*If you wish to complete Garmiel's book, you must collect the runes madeby the blood of the dark succubus.<br1>
* There are many dark succubi at theSpider Nest to the west of the Altar of Rites in the northern region.<br1>
Kill them and find the Bloody Runes.<br1>
Take these five blank sheets.<br1>
Ifyou put the scroll sheet near the blood, the blood will soak in and formrunes.<br1>
If you bring *five Bloody Runes*, I will put the runes togetherto make you Garmiel's book.<br1>
