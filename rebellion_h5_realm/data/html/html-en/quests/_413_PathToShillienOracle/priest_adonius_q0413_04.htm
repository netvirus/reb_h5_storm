<font color="36DC25">Priest Adonius:</font><br>
Unlike your gods, who hide truth within darkness,Einhasad is a benevolent god.<br1>
We priests have been permitted a portionof the songs of light, written in Andariel's Book.<br1>
If you have decidedto repent your wicked past and follow the creed of the light, I willgive you a copy of the ancient book.<br1>
Atonement is not that easy.<br1>
If yougo east of here to the Ruins of Despair, there are many undead thatcannot rest in death.<br1>
To destroy these undead, you must send the goodspirits still trapped inside them into the arms of Einhasad.<br1>
*If youbring back ten Ashen Bones that can be obtained by killing the skeletonsor zombies in the Ruins of Despair, you will finish your atonementritual.<br1>
