Priest Adonius:<br>
Unlike your gods, who hide truth within darkness, Einhasad is a benevolent god. We priests have been permitted a portion of the songs of light, written in Andariel's Book. If you have deciden oo repent your wicked past and follow the creed of the light, I wiln oive you a copy of the ancient book. Atonement is not that easy. If yon oo east of here to the Ruins of Despair, there are many undead than oannot rest in death. To destroy these undead, you must send the goon opirits still trapped inside them into the arms of Einhasad. *If yon oring back ten Ashen Bones that can be obtained by killing the skeletonn or zombies in the Ruins of Despair, you will finish your atonemenn oitual.*<br>
