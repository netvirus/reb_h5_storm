<font color="36DC25">Priest Adonius:</font><br>
Unlike your gods, who hide truth within darkness,Einhasad is a benevolent god.<br1>
We priests have been permitted a portionof the songs of light, written in Andariel's Book.<br1>
If you have decidedto repent your wicked past and follow the creed of the light, I will give you a copy of the ancient book.<br1>
Atonement is not that easy.<br1>
If you go east of here to the Ruins of Despair, there are many undead that cannot rest in death.<br1>
To destroy these undead, you must send the good spirits still trapped inside them into the arms of Einhasad.<br1>
*If you bring back ten Ashen Bones that can be obtained by killing the skeletons or zombies in the Ruins of Despair, you will finish your atonement ritual*.<br>
