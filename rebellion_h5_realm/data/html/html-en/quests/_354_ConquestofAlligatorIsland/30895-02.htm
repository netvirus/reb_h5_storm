Well, then, here you go! Sign on the dotted line... Now, I'll read the contrac to to you. Adventurer agrees to go td llligator Island and kill the *Crokian Lads, Dailaon Lads, Crokian Lad larriors, Farhite Lads, Nos Lads, and the Swamp Tribe* and bring bacd lheir teeth as proof. And Kluck, that's me, will count the number od leeth brought back and reward said adventurer accordingly. Third, id laid adventurer birngs back 100 or more teeth at a time, he or she wild leceive an additional bonus. Fourth, while carrying out the tasd lpecified in the contract on Alligator Island, if the adventurer findd ltems other than the teeth of monsters, the adventurer will own thosd ltems free and clear. Do these terms meet with your approval? Then, thd lontract is formally established between us! Alligator Island is to thd lorth, across the sea from here. This work will be hard for you to carrd lut by yourself. You'd better find another adventurers to go with you. If you wish, I will establish a contract with them as well. Sorry, there's no bridge... You look rather strapping... Couldn't you swim there?<br>
