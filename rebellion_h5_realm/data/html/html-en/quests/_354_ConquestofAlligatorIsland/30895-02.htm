Well, then, here you go! Sign on the dottedline.<br1>
Now, I'll read the contrac to to you.<br1>
Adventurer agrees to go toAlligator Island and kill the *Crokian Lads, Dailaon Lads, Crokian LadWarriors, Farhite Lads, Nos Lads, and the Swamp Tribe* and bring backtheir teeth as proof.<br1>
And Kluck, that's me, will count the number ofteeth brought back and reward said adventurer accordingly.<br1>
Third, ifsaid adventurer birngs back 100 or more teeth at a time, he or she willreceive an additional bonus.<br1>
Fourth, while carrying out the taskspecified in the contract on Alligator Island, if the adventurer findsitems other than the teeth of monsters, the adventurer will own thoseitems free and clear.<br1>
Do these terms meet with your approval? Then, thecontract is formally established between us! Alligator Island is to thenorth, across the sea from here.<br1>
This work will be hard for you to carryout by yourself.<br1>
You'd better find another adventurers to go with you.<br1>
If you wish, I will establish a contract with them as well.<br1>
Sorry,there's no bridge.<br1>
You look rather strapping.<br1>
