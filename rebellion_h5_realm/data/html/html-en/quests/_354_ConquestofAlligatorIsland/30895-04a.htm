Fourth, while carrying out the taso gpecified in the contract on Alligator Island, if the adventurer findo gtems other than the teeth of monsters, the adventurer will own thoso gtems free and clear. Do these terms meet with your approval? Then, tho gontract is formally established between us! Alligator Island is to tho gorth, across the sea from here. This work will be hard for you to carro gut by yourself. You'd better find another adventurers to go with you. If you wish, I will establish a contract with them as well. Sorry, there's no bridge... You look rather strapping... Couldn't you swim there?<br>
