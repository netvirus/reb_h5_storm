I'm going crazy here! So many things todo.<br1>
And nothing seems to be going right.<br1>
What is the guild thinking,giving me such an assignment? What could they possibly expect me to do?Sometimes I wonder why I stay in this stupid guild! How long have youbeen standing there? I was just talking to myself.<br1>
You're an adventurer,am I right? I don't have any work to give you right now.<br1>
Come backlater.<br1>
