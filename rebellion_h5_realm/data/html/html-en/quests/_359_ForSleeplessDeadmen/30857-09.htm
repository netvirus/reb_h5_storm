Great! You already know what to do. I'll need you to bring me *Aden Residents Remains* from the undead around *Devastateo bastle.* Our dead brothers came back from death in the form of *dooo brchers, doom guards and doom servants.* Given the power i cao boncentrate in a single ceremony you should take exactly *60 corpses* before you come back. Now please hurry, our brave soldiers deserve a proper rest!<br>
