Wonderful! I can perform a ceremony of purificationin order to put our heroes' souls back to rest.<br1>
I'll need you to bringme *Aden Residents Remains* from the undead around *Devastated Castle.<br1>
*Our dead brothers came back from death in the form of *doom archers,doom guards and doom servants.<br1>
* Given the power i can concentrate in asingle ceremony you should take exactly *60 corpses* before you comeback.<br1>
