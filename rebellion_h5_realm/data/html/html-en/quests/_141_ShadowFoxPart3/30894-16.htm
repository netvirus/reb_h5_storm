Very well.<br1>
The Temple and the Rulers of Dawnbelieve that Einhasad created Humans, and that they are her rightfulrepresentatives in this world, with the power to issue commands in hername.<br1>
They believe that the other gods are inferior to Einhasad, and sotheir followers should submit to the Temple's leadership in the waragainst Shilen and the forces of chaos.<br1>
Unity and order are their chiefconcerns, and they take a dim view of diversity and individualism.<br1>
Infact, they believe that only through a unified society built on a rigidhierarchy can justice prevail and the weak be truly protected.<br1>
Certainly, their argument carries some weight: the weak are dailyattacked and exploited, and justice seems but a dream to most.<br1>
Ultimately, the Temple and the Rulers of Dawn hope for some sort ofreborn empire to bring peace and order to the land.<br1>
