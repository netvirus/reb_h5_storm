Our organization takes a neutral stance in anydispute over power or ideology, nor am I personally interested in thosethings.<br1>
Normally we accept our missions based on the size of thepayment.<br1>
In this case, however, both sides have offered us the sameamount.<br1>
So I am giving this to you to decide.<br1>
Choose well -- ourorganization will abide by your decision.<br1>
