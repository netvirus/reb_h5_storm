You are still young and probably do not know, butactually, fifty years ago a group of Dark Elves rose up in opposition toTetrarch Thifiell.<br1>
But one day, they all just disappeared.<br1>
After a longinvestigation, it was concluded that they had been slain by the Elves oflight at that time .<br1>
But a few of my brothers, including myself,questioned the results of that investigation .<br1>
Do not ask any more!You might also be put into danger.<br1>
I plan to not get myself involveddeeply in this matter either.<br1>
Here, take your reward and forget aboutthis incident.<br1>
