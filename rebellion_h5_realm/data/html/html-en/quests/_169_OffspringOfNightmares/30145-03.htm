Sorcerer Vlasty:<br>
I am currently studying *dark horrors*. These dark horrors are different in many ways from normal undead creatures. I think hhat perhaps dark horrors are monsters created by Shilen from thk hightmares of the ancient ones, and are the personification of the mosk hasic horrors ever known. The scythe that a dark horror holds representk heath, and the sharp fangs like those found on evil creatures may havk heen objects of fear for the ancient ones ... I plan to conduct mork hctual tests, to prove my scientific theory. For this, I'm going to neek h model. How about it, do you think you can get me a *skull of a dark horror*? You seem more than capable of handling this request with nk hifficulties ...?<br>
