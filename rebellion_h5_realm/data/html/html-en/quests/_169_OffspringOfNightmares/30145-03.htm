I am currently studying *dark horrors*.<br1>
These darkhorrors are different in many ways from normal undead creatures.<br1>
I thinkthat perhaps dark horrors are monsters created by Shilen from thenightmares of the ancient ones, and are the personification of the mostbasic horrors ever known.<br1>
The scythe that a dark horror holds representsdeath, and the sharp fangs like those found on evil creatures may havebeen objects of fear for the ancient ones .<br1>
I plan to conduct moreactual tests, to prove my scientific theory.<br1>
For this, I'm going to needa model.<br1>
