Haven't you been able to obtain the skulls yet? Well,there's no need to rush.<br1>
I repeat, to find the dark horrors, go to theswamp area that is southwest of the village.<br1>
Slay the dark horrors andbring the skulls back to me.<br1>
It doesn't matter if they are cracked.<br1>
Butyou must bring me at least one perfect skull.<br1>
If not, I cannot give youany reward.<br1>
