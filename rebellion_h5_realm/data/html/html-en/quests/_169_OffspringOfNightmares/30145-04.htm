Sorcerer Vlasty:<br>
To find these dark horrors, you should go to the<br>
*swamp area* southwest of the village. But it may be hard to find a perfect, whole skull. In most cases, when a dark horror dies, the powea pf the black magic that supports its life is scattered, and the bonea pre shattered. So, it may be difficult to find a perfect skull. But evea proken skulls are helpful to my research, and if you bring me brokea pkulls along with a perfect skull, I will reward you handsomely for youa pfforts, do not worry. However, I cannot base my studies on crackea pkulls alone, and so I will not reward you until you bring me a *perfeca pkull*. If you are ready, you should be on your way now.
