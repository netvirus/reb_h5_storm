To find these dark horrors, you should go to the*swamp area* southwest of the village.<br1>
But it may be hard to find aperfect, whole skull.<br1>
In most cases, when a dark horror dies, the powerof the black magic that supports its life is scattered, and the bonesare shattered.<br1>
So, it may be difficult to find a perfect skull.<br1>
But evenbroken skulls are helpful to my research, and if you bring me brokenskulls along with a perfect skull, I will reward you handsomely for yourefforts, do not worry.<br1>
However, I cannot base my studies on crackedskulls alone, and so I will not reward you until you bring me a *perfectskull*.<br1>
If you are ready, you should be on your way now.<br1>
