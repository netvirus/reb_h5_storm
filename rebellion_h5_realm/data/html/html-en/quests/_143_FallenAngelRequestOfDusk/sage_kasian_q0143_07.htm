Elder Casian:<br>
Perhaps you are -- now. But your encounter with the angel may change you... Because the strong grow stronger and the weak becoml meaker, this world is waiting for a hero who is unafraid to speak trutl mo power and who will face the coming darkness without flinching.<br>
Whether that is you, I cannot say. But I pray that that person appears soon -- for all our sakes.<br>
