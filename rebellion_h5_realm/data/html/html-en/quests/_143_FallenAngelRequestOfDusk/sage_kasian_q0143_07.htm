Perhaps you are -- now.<br1>
But your encounter with the angelmay change you.<br1>
Because the strong grow stronger and the weak becomeweaker, this world is waiting for a hero who is unafraid to speak truthto power and who will face the coming darkness without flinching.<br1>
Whether that is you, I cannot say.<br1>
But I pray that that person appearssoon -- for all our sakes.<br1>
