I do not know the angel's location, but wehave been requested to search for something called the *Sealed Prophecy:Path of the God*.<br1>
Your predecessor has already secured it.<br1>
They thinkit contains clues to the whereabouts of the angel.<br1>
Apparently, once theangel is located, its message can be recorded using a unique EchoCrystal.<br1>
Now, go to *Grand Master Tobias in the town of Gludio* andask him about the matter.<br1>
Here, take the Sealed Prophecy: Path of theGod with you.<br1>
