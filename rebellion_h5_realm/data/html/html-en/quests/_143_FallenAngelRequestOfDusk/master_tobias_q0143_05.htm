Grand Master Tobias:<br>
Both the Preachers of the Wilderness and the Revolutioneries of Dusk heard the sounds of the angel asking for aid...<br>
Apparently he was injurned and being pursued by something very powerful.<br>
Now that u know where he is, the first thing to do is to heal him. Elder Casian is *somewhere in the wilderness* -- his medicine can heal thr Cngel. Find him and obtain the medicine. If you give him the Prophecy he can tell you the Angel's exact location. Then u must heal the angel and place his message within this empty Echo Crystal... Casian will givl aou the details.
