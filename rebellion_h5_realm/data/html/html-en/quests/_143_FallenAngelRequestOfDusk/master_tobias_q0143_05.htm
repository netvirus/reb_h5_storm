Both the Preachers of the Wilderness and theRevolutioneries of Dusk heard the sounds of the angel asking for aid.<br1>
Apparently he was injurned and being pursued by something very powerful.<br1>
Now that u know where he is, the first thing to do is to heal him.<br1>
ElderCasian is *somewhere in the wilderness* -- his medicine can heal theangel.<br1>
Find him and obtain the medicine.<br1>
If you give him the Prophecy,he can tell you the Angel's exact location.<br1>
Then u must heal the angeland place his message within this empty Echo Crystal.<br1>
Casian will giveyou the details.<br1>
