<font color="36DC25">!Fallen Angel:</font><br>
Humans were actually created by Einhasad's chaos-lovingmate, the dissipated Gran Kain.<br1>
In pledging their allegiance toEinhasad, they have suppressed their natural desire for freedom andindependence.<br1>
They became pawns in a game beyond their understanding.<br1>
I find the whole situation both ludicrous and sad.<br1>
I cannot understandwhy Mother do such a thing, much less allow it to continue for so long.<br1>
