When I was 10, I decided to kill all the wolves inthe world, because they killed my loving family.<br1>
I didn't want this tohappen to others, you see.<br1>
That's why I became a wolf hunter.<br1>
I stillvividly remember my first kill.<br1>
It was a wolf cub that was only a fewdays old.<br1>
I killed it without mercy.<br1>
After that, I killed every wolfthat I saw! I killed hundreds, I mean, thousands of wolves! People sawme carrying a bundle of wolf pelts and called me the *Redbonnet thehorrible*.<br1>
But now I am too old to hunt wolves.<br1>
So, someone should killthe wolves in my stead! I want to smell their blood.<br1>
The bloody stenchof the enemies who killed my family! Please.<br1>
It is my wish.<br1>
