I was looking for information about this in thebook, we have found in the Library of Runes.<br1>
And here I found thefollowing inscription: "When will bypass around the monastery, and therewill be a path leading to the library, you can find a special device,which moves to the cell of the prioress.<br1>
" So there it is written.<br1>
We canonly detect this device.<br1>
We can go right now Monastery of Silence.<br1>
Ithink BL easily figure everything out.<br1>
I'll follow you.<br1>
You're ready, goon a quest.<br1>
