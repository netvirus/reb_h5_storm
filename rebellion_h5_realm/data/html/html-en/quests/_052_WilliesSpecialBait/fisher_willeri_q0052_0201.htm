Thanks for the eyes. Take this *bait of land*. It finds more valuable items than baits of wind or chill.<br>
Remember, this bait only works when your fishing level is exactly 16.<br>
Whether or not you land your catch will depend on your skill. Remember,<br>
if you catch anything besides fish, bring it to me unopened! Don't even bother bringing me opened boxes.
