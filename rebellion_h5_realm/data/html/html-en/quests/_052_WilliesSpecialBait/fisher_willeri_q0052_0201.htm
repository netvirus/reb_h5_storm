Thanks for the eyes.<br1>
Take this *baitof land*.<br1>
It finds more valuable items than baits of wind or chill.<br1>
Remember, this bait only works when your fishing level is exactly 16.<br1>
Whether or not you land your catch will depend on your skill.<br1>
Remember,if you catch anything besides fish, bring it to me unopened! Don't evenbother bringing me opened boxes.<br1>
