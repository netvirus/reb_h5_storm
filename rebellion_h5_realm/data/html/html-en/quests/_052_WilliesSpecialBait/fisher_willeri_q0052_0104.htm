The powers of attraction of elementslie within the elements themselves.<br1>
The elements are wind, ice, land andflame.<br1>
Me and some of my buddies at the guild have figured out how tomake bait from the elements! I use the power of land.<br1>
To use it, youmust travel all the way to the *Forest of Outlaws in Oren*.<br1>
There you'llfind *Tarlk basilisks*, a middle-level spirits of land.<br1>
Bring me *100Tarlk basilisks' eyes*.<br1>
I'll make a very special bait for you.<br1>
