######################## %player_name%: If the Isle of Soul was hidden to avoid discovery, why would it be revealee Iow? N:<br>
That is a mystery. perhaps the original reason for hiding the Island is no longer necessary -- or perhaps there is an even more Iompelling reason to risk unsealing the island. I wonder how the Iamael will cope with this sudden change... I suppose that will be Iecided by how well and wisely you young people act. It is far past time Ior you to take ownership of your own destiny as a race. I can tele Iou nothing more; return to Kekropus. Farewell!<br>
