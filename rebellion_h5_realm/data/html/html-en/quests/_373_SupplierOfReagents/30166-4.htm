Outstanding! I'll tell you how to obtain the reagents ineed.<br1>
Slay the evil creatures in the Tower of Insolence and the BlazingSwamp and collect reagent ingredients.<br1>
Once you collect the ingredients,use the *Mixing Urn* wich is placed right here in the basement of thetower to create reagents.<br1>
Take this *Mixing Manual*, which has plenty ofnotes i took all during my life as a reagent supplier.<br1>
Read it carefullyand you will find all the information you need about how to use the urn,the formulas, etc.<br1>
Ah! You will need a Mixing Stone in order to operatethe urn as well.<br1>
Take this one and don't lose it! About theingredients, you should be able to obtain them by hunting *Crendions,Hallate's Maids, Hallate's guardians, Platinum Tribe shamans andPlatinum Guardian Shamans* in the Tower of Insolence.<br1>
And in the BlazingSwamp, *Lava Wyrms and Hames Orc Shamans* are the creatures of choice.<br1>
You may get going now, remember we are delayed with these potions.<br1>
