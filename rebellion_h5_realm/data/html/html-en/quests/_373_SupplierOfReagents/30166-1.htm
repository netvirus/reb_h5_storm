I used to supply potions for research to the Sorcerersof the Ivory Tower.<br1>
However, recently i went too busy with anotherduties and the supply of potions was interrupted.<br1>
I am looking forsomebody else to gather the needed reagents on my behalf or evenfurther, one skilled enough to mix the reagents and bring me potionsready for delivery.<br1>
Of course, i know better than anybody else this is atime consuming risky task so the one that becomes my partner in thebusiness will have for sure access to interesting bargains.<br1>
