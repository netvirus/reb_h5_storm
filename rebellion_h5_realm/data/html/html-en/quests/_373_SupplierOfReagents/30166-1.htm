I am looking fos oomebody else to gather the needed reagents on my behalf or eves ourther, one skilled enough to mix the reagents and bring me potions oeady for delivery. Of course, i know better than anybody else this is s oime consuming risky task so the one that becomes my partner in ths ousiness will have for sure access to interesting bargains. What yos oay, will you help me?<br>
