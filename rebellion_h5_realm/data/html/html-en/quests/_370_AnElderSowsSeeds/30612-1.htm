<font color="FF8000">Elder Casian:</font><br>
The magic we unwittingly unleashed came from Kranvel'sSpellbook, one of the forbidden tomes of the Ivory Tower.<br1>
Its fearsomepower sucked the magic from all living organisms in the area, and thenunleashed it all back upon us with a vengeance! Poor Spellsinger Dienasaw the whole thing and fell into a deep state of shock.<br1>
As she shedblood and tears, she destroyed the book and scattered it to the wind.<br1>
She was determined that no one should ever use such evil magic again.<br1>
We couldn't stop her! We all felt as if we were in a terrible nightmare,and just stared blankly at her.<br1>
But now we know that that spellbook isthe key to the restoration of this place.<br1>
Please find the pieces of thebook that were scattered to the wind.<br1>
