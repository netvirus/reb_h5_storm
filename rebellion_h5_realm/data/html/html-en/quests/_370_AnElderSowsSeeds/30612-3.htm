In order to obtain the pieces of the spellbook, you mustconquer the *ant recruits, ant patrols, ant guards, the noble ant andthe noble ant leader*.<br1>
*Check carefully any scraps of paper you comeacross*.<br1>
The pieces of "Kranvel's Spellbook" should be easy to identify.<br1>
The spellbook has four chapters: *the Chapter of Fire, the Chapter ofWater, the Chapter of Wind and the Chapter of Earth*.<br1>
The contents willonly be discernible if you recover all four chapters.<br1>
This is achallenging task, but I think you are ready for it.<br1>
May the divineblessing be with you.<br1>
