Let's see, the Chapter of Fire, the Chapter of Water, theChapter of Wind, and the Chapter of Earth.<br1>
you have brought them all!Perhaps your discovery will lead to a way to restore this ruined place.<br1>
At last I shall be redeemed.<br1>
This is all thanks to you.<br1>
Please acceptthis humble token of my appreciation.<br1>
But this sad chapter is not yetcomplete.<br1>
The dark magic that caused this disaster had many sources,united in their power and holding copies of "Kranvel's Spellbook"! Alas,it's true! There remain many pieces of that horrid tome scattered aboutthe inside of the Ant Nest.<br1>
