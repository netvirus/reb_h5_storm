Did you know that at one time this barren wasteland wasone of the most fertile places in Aden? For centuries, farmers sowedtheir seeds and harvested their abundant crops here.<br1>
Ah, yes, those werethe days.<br1>
But then that devil Beleth and his minions arrived.<br1>
We hadto act quickly.<br1>
We were compelled to at last open the forbiddenspellbook.<br1>
For two days and nights fire rained down on us and darkmagic swept over the land like a whirlwind.<br1>
It wasn't at all what we'danticipated.<br1>
When it was over, this is all that was left.<br1>
A dustywasteland inhabited by weird-looking freaks.<br1>
Some day, hopefully, weshall find a way to change this place back into the verdant farmland itonce was.<br1>
I hope we can count on you when that time comes.<br1>
