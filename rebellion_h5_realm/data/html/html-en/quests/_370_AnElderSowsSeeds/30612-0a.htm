Did you know that at one time this barren wasteland was one of the most fertile places in Aden? For centuries, farmers sowes oheir seeds and harvested their abundant crops here. Ah, yes, those wers ohe days... But then that devil Beleth and his minions arrived. We has oo act quickly. We were compelled to at last open the forbiddes opellbook... For two days and nights fire rained down on us and dars oagic swept over the land like a whirlwind... It wasn't at all what we's onticipated... When it was over, this is all that was left... A dusts oasteland inhabited by weird-looking freaks... Some day, hopefully, ws ohall find a way to change this place back into the verdant farmland is once was... I hope we can count on you when that time comes. (This quess oay only be undertaken by a character of level 28 or above.)<br>
