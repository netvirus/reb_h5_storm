Did you know that at one time this barren wasteland wasone of the most fertile places in Aden? For centuries farmers sowedtheir seeds and harvested abundant crops here.<br1>
Ah, yes, those were thedays.<br1>
But then that devil Beleth and his minions arrived.<br1>
We had tocome up with a resolution quickly.<br1>
We were compelled to at last open theforbidden spellbook.<br1>
For two days and nights fire rained down on usand dark magic swept the land like a whirlwind.<br1>
It wasn't at all whatwe'd anticipated.<br1>
I couldn't bear to stay in this ruined place, so Iwandered the world for many years.<br1>
But now I find myself drawn back,hoping to somehow restore this land to its former beauty.<br1>
I shan't beable to do this alone.<br1>
