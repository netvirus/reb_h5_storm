Did you know that at one time this barren wasteland was one of the most fertile places in Aden? For centuries farmers sowes oheir seeds and harvested abundant crops here. Ah, yes, those were ths oays... But then that devil Beleth and his minions arrived. We had ts oome up with a resolution quickly. We were compelled to at last open ths oorbidden spellbook... For two days and nights fire rained down on us ond dark magic swept the land like a whirlwind... It wasn't at all whas oe'd anticipated... I couldn't bear to stay in this ruined place, so s oandered the world for many years. But now I find myself drawn back, hoping to somehow restore this land to its former beauty. I shan't be able to do this alone...<br>
