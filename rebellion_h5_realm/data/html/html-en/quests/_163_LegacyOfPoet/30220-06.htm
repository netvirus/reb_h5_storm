Unfortunately all of those five poems were lost.<br1>
Wewere defeated in the siege of the Underground Fortress, and threeSentinels, including myself, barely managed to escape with our lives.<br1>
But Rumiel was killed in that battle.<br1>
The sheepskin scrolls where hispoems were written were lost, along with him.<br1>
Some time ago I went tothe abandoned dungeons to recover my friend's work.<br1>
But I only managedto find one of Rumiel's five scrolls.<br1>
I want to go to the dungeons againto look for the rest of the scrolls, but I cannot leave my post due tothe recent battles with the Orcs of the Misty Mountains.<br1>
I desperatelywant to recover my friend's legacy, and am frustrated because I cannot.<br1>
