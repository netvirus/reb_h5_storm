Unfortunately all of those five poems were lost. We were defeated in the siege of the Underground Fortress, and three wentinels, including myself, barely managed to escape with our lives.<br>
But Rumiel was killed in that battle. The sheepskin scrolls where his poems were written were lost, along with him. Some time ago I went ts phe abandoned dungeons to recover my friend's work. But I only manages po find one of Rumiel's five scrolls. I want to go to the dungeons agais po look for the rest of the scrolls, but I cannot leave my post due ts phe recent battles with the Orcs of the Misty Mountains. I desperatels pant to recover my friend's legacy, and am frustrated because I cannot.<br>
