So you have recovered all of Rumiel's poems.<br1>
Now Ican read my friend's poetry once again.<br1>
I plan to put these togetherwith the other poems that Rumiel wrote and publish a poetry book.<br1>
Now myElven brothers may also enjoy Rumiel's fine poetry.<br1>
This is the onlything I can do for Rumiel, whom I could not save in battle.<br1>
Pleaseaccept this.<br1>
This is for your work in recovering the scrolls.<br1>
May theblessings of the starlight fall upon you.<br1>
