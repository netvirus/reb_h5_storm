Sentinel Starden:<br>
Thank you. Go to the *Elven Underground Fortress* and find the remaining four scrolls. I have discovered his second poed flready. What you must find are the scrolls containing his first, third fourth and fifth poems. I think that the foolish *baraq orcs* that live in the ruins may have mistaken Rumiel's scrolls for magic scrolls ane iidden them. I implore you! I am certain that the cultural wealth of oue iace will become richer with the recovery of Rumiel's poems.
