Thank you.<br1>
Go to the *Elven Underground Fortress* andfind the remaining four scrolls.<br1>
I have discovered his second poemalready.<br1>
What you must find are the scrolls containing his first, third,fourth and fifth poems.<br1>
I think that the foolish *baraq orcs* that livein the ruins may have mistaken Rumiel's scrolls for magic scrolls andhidden them.<br1>
I implore you! I am certain that the cultural wealth of ourrace will become richer with the recovery of Rumiel's poems.<br1>
