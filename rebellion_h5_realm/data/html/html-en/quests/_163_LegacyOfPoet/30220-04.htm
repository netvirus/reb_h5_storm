<font color="36DC25">!Sentinel Starden:</font><br>
During the fiercest battle with the Dark Elves,Rumiel and I, along with a few dozen sentinel brothers, faced the DarkElves that had surrounded our fortress.<br1>
The Dark Elves did not engage indirect battle but used hit and run tactics, slowly tiring us out.<br1>
Rumielwas in the most pain during that time.<br1>
The battle had deeply scarred hissensitive soul.<br1>
During the siege in the Underground Fortress, Rumielcomposed *five poems*.<br1>
It was the most beautiful poetry I had ever heard-- poems that turned the fear and despair of that time into verses.<br1>
