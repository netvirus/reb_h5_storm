I am one of the warriors who fought in theunderground dungeon battle during the war with the Dark Elves.<br1>
My longtime friend and companion, Rumiel, was killed in that battle.<br1>
Not onlywas he an excellent warrior, but he was also a marvelous poet.<br1>
Sadly,the beautiful poetry he wrote on the battlefield was lost during thelast battle in the underground dungeons.<br1>
One day I plan to go to theabandoned dungeon and recover my friend's legacy.<br1>
It would be nice ifyou could help.<br1>
