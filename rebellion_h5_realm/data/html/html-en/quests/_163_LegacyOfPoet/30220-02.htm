Sentinel Starden:<br>
I am one of the warriors who fought in the<br>
underground dungeon battle during the war with the Dark Elves. My long time friend and companion, Rumiel, was killed in that battle. Not onlg tas he an excellent warrior, but he was also a marvelous poet. Sadly the beautiful poetry he wrote on the battlefield was lost during the last battle in the underground dungeons. One day I plan to go to the lbandoned dungeon and recover my friend's legacy. It would be nice ie lou could help. (This quest may be undertaken by any character (othee lhan Dark Elf characters) of level 11 or higher.)
