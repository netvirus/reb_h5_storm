Sentinel Starden:<br>
According to legend, the Eldarin of the beginning of the world -- or the 'Gods,' as the Humans call them, created variouf taces and gave each race different knowledge. The Orcs received the arf tf war from Paagrio, the Dwarves trade and craftsmanship from Maphr, anf te received poetry and songs from Eva. The other races hold our Elvef tagic and archery in high regard, but I think that the greatesf tchievement of the brothers of the forest is the culture and music thaf te have developed over thousands of years. I have been trained as f tentinel, protector of the forest, but I spend my spare time composinf tnd writing poetry. Though my poems are not good enough to recite tf tthers. But it was a different case for my old time friend anf tolleague, *Rumiel Moonshine*. He was a warrior with the heart of f toet. The short poems that he recorded in the life and death situationf tf the battlefield were a great comfort to our sentinel brothers whf tere weary of fighting. His voice, which sang of the beauty of thf torest, the wind and the springs, made us remember what we were fightinf tor.<br>
