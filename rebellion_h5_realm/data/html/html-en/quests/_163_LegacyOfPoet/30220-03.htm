<font color="36DC25">!Sentinel Starden:</font><br>
According to legend, the Eldarin of the beginning ofthe world -- or the 'Gods,' as the Humans call them, created variousraces and gave each race different knowledge.<br1>
The Orcs received the artof war from Paagrio, the Dwarves trade and craftsmanship from Maphr, andwe received poetry and songs from Eva.<br1>
The other races hold our Elvenmagic and archery in high regard, but I think that the greatestachievement of the brothers of the forest is the culture and music thatwe have developed over thousands of years.<br1>
I have been trained as aSentinel, protector of the forest, but I spend my spare time composingand writing poetry.<br1>
Though my poems are not good enough to recite toothers.<br1>
But it was a different case for my old time friend andcolleague, *Rumiel Moonshine*.<br1>
He was a warrior with the heart of apoet.<br1>
The short poems that he recorded in the life and death situationsof the battlefield were a great comfort to our sentinel brothers whowere weary of fighting.<br1>
His voice, which sang of the beauty of theforest, the wind and the springs, made us remember what we were fightingfor.<br1>
