Thank you! You are truly kind.<br1>
While travellingthrough the Spine Mine Field, you will see many *whinstone golems*, oneof the legacies of the ancient giants, wandering around.<br1>
Please collect*twenty starstones* from their bodies.<br1>
That should be enough energy fornow.<br1>
I don't have much, but I can give you a *gatekeeper's token* thatlets you use the teleport service.<br1>
