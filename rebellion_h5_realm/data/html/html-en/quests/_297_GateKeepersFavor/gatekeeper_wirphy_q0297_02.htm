Most of my body parts were created by combiningmaterials from the previous creations of the ancient giants.<br1>
But becausethe remains are not complete, I can always feel energy draining out ofmy body.<br1>
My body could not be perfected with Dwarven technology, so theyopted for a second choice -- rechargeable energy.<br1>
But I used too muchenergy while recently teleporting a large group of traders.<br1>
