Wonderful! This island is filled with perils, so the wizards andDwarven artisans studying these dinosaurs need the help of braveadventurers to collect the materials necessary to complete their work.<br1>
They asked me to recommend someone skilled enough and brave enough tohandle the task.<br1>
You seem a likely candidate! Go and defeat the*Velociraptor, Pterosaur, Ornithomimus and Deinonychus* and bring backsamples of their biological tissue.<br1>
For your information, one *AncientEgg* and 150 dinosaur biological tissues can be processed as one set ofsamples.<br1>
You need 1 Ancient Egg and 450 dinosaur biological tissues forrecipe exchange.<br1>
You will be able to find the egg while exploring thedinosaur's habitat.<br1>
But be very careful! When the egg is disturbed, *thenearby dinosaurs will come running to protect it.<br1>
We do not require asmany eggs as biological tissue, so assess the situation carefully and dowhat you think is best.<br1>
