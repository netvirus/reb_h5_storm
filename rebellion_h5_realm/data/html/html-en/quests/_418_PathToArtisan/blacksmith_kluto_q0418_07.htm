<font color="FFFF00">Blacksmith Kluto:</font><br>
Thank you, youngster.<br1>
So, from now on I want you to listen carefully to what I say.<br1>
Take this letter that I give you to *Blacksmith Pinter in the town of Gludio*.<br1>
If you give him the letter, he will give you something.<br1>
Bring that back to me. What do you think?<br1>
It's very easy, isn't it?<br1>
Now that you know, depart quickly!<br1>
Every moment is critical!<br>
