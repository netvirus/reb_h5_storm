I'm sorry but you don't have the qualifications to become an Artisan.<br1>
It troubles me if you think it is an easy job.<br1>
Only those who have at least the minimum qualifications are allowed to take the test.<br1>
Go gather more experience.<br1>
Do not come back until you are at least level 18.
