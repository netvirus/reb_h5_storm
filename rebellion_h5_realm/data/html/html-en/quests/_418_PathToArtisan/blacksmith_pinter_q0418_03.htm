Are you sure? Could you do that?<br1>
If so, I can give you one clue. This is a footprint that was discovered on the floor of the blacksmith shop on the night of the robbery.<br1>
I think that it is probably the footprint of the thief. Looking at the footprint, there is no doubt that it is one of a *Vuku Orc fighter*.<br1>
If you catch them and destroy them, I'm sure something will come out.<br1>
Here, I will give you an impression of the footstep to use as a clue in catching the thief.<br1>
By the way, the thing that was stolen was a large box.<br1>
Thank you.<br>
