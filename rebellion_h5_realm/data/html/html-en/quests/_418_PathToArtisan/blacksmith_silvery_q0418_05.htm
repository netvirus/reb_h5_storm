Oh, fine, fine! I see that you are ready for the Artisan test. It is administered by the guild master of the Black Anvil, of whom you have certainly heard - a blacksmith of great renown!<br1>
I will give the first, most basic of the tests; if you pass, you may go on to the second test.<br1>
Shall we begin?<br>
