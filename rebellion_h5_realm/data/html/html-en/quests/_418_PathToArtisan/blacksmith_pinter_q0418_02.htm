Actually, Kluto asked me for something before...<br1>
I kept it hidden in the corner of the blacksmith's shop for a long time, but oh dear, the item has been stolen!<br1>
If I don't have it, Kluto will be terribly angry... he may seem like a gentleman but he has a temper like fire.<br1>
When he is angry, not even the head blacksmiths can calm him.<br1>
How will I find that item?<br>
