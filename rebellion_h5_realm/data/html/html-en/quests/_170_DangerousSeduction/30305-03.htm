Have you ever suffered the pain of not being able tosleep? I have lately been plagued every night by *bad dreams*.<br1>
Everynight a beautiful woman with fair skin white as snow and hair black asebony comes to my side and places her blood-red lips near my ear,speaking horrendous and unspeakable things with a hissing voice like asnake that makes my insides burn .<br1>
The strangest thing is, when I wakeup, I cannot remember any of her terrifying, chilling stories.<br1>
I havecalled upon all of my magic knowledge, but I have yet to find out theidentity of the culprit responsible for sending a devil into my dreams.<br1>
But I have been able to find out the identity of the monster thatappears in my nightmare.<br1>
It is the *succubus* named *Merkenis*, whomakes her home inside of the abandoned *School of Dark Arts*.<br1>
I do notknow what her purpose is, but I want to escape from this cursednightmare as soon as I can.<br1>
