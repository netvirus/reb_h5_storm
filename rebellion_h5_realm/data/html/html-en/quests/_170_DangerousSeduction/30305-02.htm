Have you ever suffered the pain of not being able tosleep? I have *bad dreams* every night these days.<br1>
Every night abeautiful woman with fair skin white as snow and hair black as ebonycomes to my side and places her blood-red lips near my ear, speakinghorrendous and unspeakable things with a hissing voice like a snake thatmakes my insides burn .<br1>
The strangest thing is, when I wake up, Icannot remember any of the terrifying, chilling stories.<br1>
This is thework of someone who wishes to send me nightmares and take over my mind,I am sure of it.<br1>
I am going to use all the power that the great *GranKain* has granted me to find the culprit.<br1>
As soon as that person'sidentity is exposed, my punishment will be swift and sure.<br1>
I hope youcan help me then .<br1>
