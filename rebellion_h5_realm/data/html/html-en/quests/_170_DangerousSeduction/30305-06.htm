So you have discovered that *Merkenis* has cast anightmare spell on me using this *nightmare crystal*.<br1>
Well done.<br1>
Now Ican rest peacefully without being haunted by nightmares .<br1>
This is allthanks to you! As promised, I will give you your reward.<br1>
While you weregone fighting *Merkenis*, I found out that the culprit was *Icarus*, ofthe house of *Hardin*.<br1>
So he dares to challenge me, under the protectionof *Hardin* .<br1>
Long ago, I won a bet against Icarus and obtained amagic scroll dear to him.<br1>
But he does not acknowledge defeat andtroubles me with such petty nightmare spells in order to get his magicscroll back .<br1>
Now that I know the culprit, I will not stay silent .<br1>
