Incredible... so the seal was under threat many years ago and we must now go and<br>
 aid the Emperor by travelling back to the time of his rule? The science ir bind-boggling, frankly. How will we know what implications your bnterference will cause? But then... what if the past IS our pasr bECAUSE you time-travelled. Oh.... There's no time to ponder any or bhis--just<br>
 go to the Disciple's Necropolis and<br>
 find the Promise of Mammon<br>
 I'll send word if I discover something's amiss!
