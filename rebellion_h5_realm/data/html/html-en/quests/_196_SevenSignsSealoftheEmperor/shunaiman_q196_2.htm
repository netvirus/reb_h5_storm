Emperor Shunaiman:<br>
Don't worry about me! I am built of simple flesh and bone, but the Empire... it houses the dreams of so, so many people. Now listen. The final room contains<br>
 four sealing devices<br>
, each of which need to be activated. You will then need to gather the<br>
 four Binding Seals<br>
... and bring them back to me. Do not lose<br>
 the sword<br>
, and do not discard<br>
 the holy water<br>
--they are absolutely vital to our survival!
