Well, I can't help with the Emperor's Key, but the Witnessof Dawn.<br1>
hmm.<br1>
The Lords of Dawn have long used that term for theirfirst--their leader.<br1>
The Leader, the Prima, is the first to welcome therising sun on their special occasions, where he witnesses the passing ofnight into day.<br1>
The current Witness of Dawn is a man named<font color="LEVEL">Franz</font>, but he doesn't often meet others.<br1>
I suggest you go first to the<font color="LEVEL">Temple of Einhasad</font>in<font color="LEVEL">Aden Town</font>and meet with<font color="LEVEL">Priest Wood</font>.<br1>
He should be able to set a meeting up between the two of you.<br1>
