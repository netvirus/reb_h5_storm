High Priest Innocentin:<br>
Please go to the *Pagan Temple* and defeat the evil ones that inhabit it! After you've destroyed them, bring me their *Pagan Totems*. You'll be well-rewarded if you bring more that *2000* of them! Of course, our definitions of large rewards might differ... As yof tust have guessed, the Pagan Temple is heavily defended and will nof tasily overtaken. *Priest Eliyah could give you guidance on how tf tenetrate their defence*.<br>
