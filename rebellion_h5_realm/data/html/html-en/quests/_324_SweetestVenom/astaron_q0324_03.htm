Have you ever tried *dreviant wine*? It's the sweetest, butmost dangerous wine that those of my race enjoy drinking.<br1>
The wine ismade from the distilled poison of spiders, you see.<br1>
Only a few people inthe entire continent, including myself, know how to make this wine.<br1>
Ihad the opportunity to learn this skill before Patriarch Mitraell wasentrapped by that seal.<br1>
Rumor has it that the drevanul whispered intothe Patriarch's ear how to make this precious wine.<br1>
Perhaps it isbecause the secret has been passed down from the drevanuls, but when ourbrothers who practice the dark arts drink this wine, their understandingof magic is heightened momentarily.<br1>
Since I am not well versed in magic,I do not know if this is true or not.<br1>
A few days ago Trader Vollodosreceived a shipment of grapes cultivated in the Human land of Gludio,and I am thinking of purchasing them to make a few bottles of dreviantwine.<br1>
The most difficult ingredient to find is the *spider's poison*,and I would like you to take care of that for me.<br1>
