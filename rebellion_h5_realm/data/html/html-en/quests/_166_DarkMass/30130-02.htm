Soon we will hold the *mass of darkness* inhonor of Gran Kain of the darkness and Shilen, the mother of the abyss.<br1>
This mass is the most sacred religious ceremony of our race.<br1>
The HumanMystics of the Ivory Tower who attended last year's mass were awed atthe size and magnificence of the mass.<br1>
This year's mass will be no lessgrand.<br1>
The clergy of the temple are very busy with preparations.<br1>
Thereare a few items needed for the mass that must be fetched from thevillage.<br1>
If we are short on help later, I may need you to deliver thoseitems for me.<br1>
