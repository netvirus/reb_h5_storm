So Undrias has sent you.<br1>
Please give this *scripture* tohim.<br1>
It was discovered in an abandoned mine by sentry warriors sent tothe Misty Mountains to fight the orcs.<br1>
Surprisingly, it is a scripturewritten by ancient Humans who served Gran Kain.<br1>
Isn't that interesting?Undrias says that he plans to recite a portion of this scripture duringthis year's mass of darkness.<br1>
Be sure to deliver this scripture to him.<br1>
