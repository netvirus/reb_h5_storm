Don't tell me that you have forgotten what youmust bring back? I will tell you one more time, so pay attention.<br1>
Getthe *ceremonial dagger* from *Iria* of the *weapons shop*, the wine from*Dorankus* of the *warehouse*, and *Garmiel's Scripture* from *MasterTrudy* of the *House of Elders*.<br1>
I hope you will not ask me again.<br1>
