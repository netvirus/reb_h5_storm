The rules are simple: I will toss a coin in the airand you guess and call out which side you think it will land on, headsor tails.<br1>
Let's try it.<br1>
If you win the first round, you can eitherreceive 10 Nebulite Orbs or play a second round.<br1>
If you win in thesecond round, you can either receive 30 Nebulite Orbs or play a thirdround.<br1>
As you keep winning rounds, the stakes will become progressivelylarger.<br1>
Oh, there's one last thing I need to explain.<br1>
If you lose youmust give me 10 Nebulite Orbs.<br1>
