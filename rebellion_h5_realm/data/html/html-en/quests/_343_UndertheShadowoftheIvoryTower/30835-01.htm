What a miserable state I'm in, neither dead or alive,just here.<br1>
What's the point? I'm undead.<br1>
No hope for me.<br1>
The liqueursupplied by my students is all that keeps me going these days.<br1>
I getdrunk and imagine that I can feel warmth of life folowing throught myveins once again.<br1>
Oh, I suppose you are wondering how an undead candrink liqueur? Have you heard of *Ectoplazm Liqueur*? That stuff willraise a corpse from his grave to dance! It is so strong that even myold, rotten tongue twitches at its taste.<br1>
Ahhhh.<br1>
What I would give fora sip right now!.<br1>
