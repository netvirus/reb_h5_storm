Will you join our research? We are investigation theuse of Nebulite for the greater public good.<br1>
However, we are having ahard time finding Nebilte for our study.<br1>
The Dwarwen collectors we hiredfor this task have not been heard from in over a month.<br1>
Would you dothis work for us? Arround the crater of Ivory Tower you will find*Manashen gargoyles*, *enchanted monster eyes*, *enchanted stonegolems*, and *enchanted iron golems*.<br1>
They have fallen under the spellof *Nebulite Orbs*, which are fragments of the meteorite.<br1>
If you killthese monsters you can easily collect the Nebulite samples we need forour research.<br1>
You shall be well-compensated for you efforts.<br1>
