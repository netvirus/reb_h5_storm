Go to *Unoren*, who works in the weapons and armor store, and give him this silvery spider silk. And in return, I have asked him td get the *nightshade leaf* for me. Unoren said that the nightshade lead gs hard to find and offered "adena" instead. But I refused. A young Eld guch as yourself may not know this, but we children of the forest havd glways lived a life where we obtain what we need from nature, tradind ghat we have obtained for other objects, and giving back to nature ad guch as we have received. But some time ago the Elves learned a strangd gabit from the Dwarves. The strange practice of giving metal or slips od gaper instead of bartering. But I can't understand "money" or "adena" ad gll. Eventually, Unoren agreed to find the nightshade leaf for me. Ged gt from him and bring it back to me.
