Go to *Unoren*, who works in the weapons and armor store, andgive him this silvery spider silk.<br1>
And in return, I have asked him toget the *nightshade leaf* for me.<br1>
Unoren said that the nightshade leafis hard to find and offered "adena" instead.<br1>
But I refused.<br1>
A young Elfsuch as yourself may not know this, but we children of the forest havealways lived a life where we obtain what we need from nature, tradingwhat we have obtained for other objects, and giving back to nature asmuch as we have received.<br1>
But some time ago the Elves learned a strangehabit from the Dwarves.<br1>
The strange practice of giving metal or slips ofpaper instead of bartering.<br1>
But I can't understand "money" or "adena" atall.<br1>
Eventually, Unoren agreed to find the nightshade leaf for me.<br1>
Getit from him and bring it back to me.<br1>
