Recently, one of your kind who lives in the village visited meand asked me to get some silvery spider silks for him.<br1>
My arachnesisters are wandering the forests and gathering the spider webs that thesilver spiders have spun.<br1>
When the collecting is finished, I'd like youto take them to the village.<br1>
I hate going into the village.<br1>
