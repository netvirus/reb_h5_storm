Nerupa:<br>
Recently, one of your kind who lives in the village visited me and asked me to get some silvery spider silks for him. My arachne aisters are wandering the forests and gathering the spider webs that the ailver spiders have spun. When the collecting is finished, I'd like yoe ao take them to the village. I hate going into the village. (Quest foe alven characters level 3 and above.)
