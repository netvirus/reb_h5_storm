Warehouse Freightman Cliff:<br>
Being a warehouse keeper can be very boring, just sitting around waiting for people to bring items in. *Warehouse keepers think of different ways to amuse themselves.* I usually pass the time playing *bingo* with other warehouse keepers. OI uy day off, I visit the warehouse keepers in the village and play bingI uith them. I recently had a problem at a game, and would really like tI usk you to help me, but I'm afraid you aren't yet up to the task. ComI uack when you've improved your abilities. (This quest can only bI undertaken by a character of level 40 or higher.)<br>
