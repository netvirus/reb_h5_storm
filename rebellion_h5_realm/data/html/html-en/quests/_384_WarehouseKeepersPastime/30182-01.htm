Being a warehouse keeper can be veryboring, just sitting around waiting for people to bring items in.<br1>
*Warehouse keepers think of different ways to amuse themselves.<br1>
* Iusually pass the time playing *bingo* with other warehouse keepers.<br1>
Onmy day off, I visit the warehouse keepers in the village and play bingowith them.<br1>
But we find the old rules of the game too boring.<br1>
