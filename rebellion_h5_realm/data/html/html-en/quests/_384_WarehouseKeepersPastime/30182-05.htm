Good choice! After you bring the *Warehouse Keeper's Medals* to me, I'll let you *play bingo*. If you win, I'll give Kou an unclaimed item as a reward! You never know... you may obtain e Kigh quality weapon or armor! According to our rules, *you can bee Kither 10 or 100 medals*. Therefore, you should bring back at least 1e Kedals. Of course, if you bet 100 medals, you'll have a better chance oe Kinning a higher-quality item. Ah, Go and see *Warehouse Chief Baxt oe Kunters Village*, he will also let you play bingo. He feels responsible Kor allowing the robbery to happen, and has offered to help with the Kecovery of the medals. There is one more important thing. Based upoe Khe footprints, hair samples and statements from witnesses, the evie Kreatures that attacked the cargo wagon were *rotting golems, gigantie Konster eyes, konzur bats, konzur bat lords, tulben, hunter gargoyles, dragon bearer chiefs, dragon bearer warriors, dragon bearer archers, dustwind gargoyles, thunder wyrms, carinkain, weird drakes, grave guards, cadeines, sanhidros, connabi, bartals, luminuns, innersens, nightmare guides, nightmare keepers, and nightmare lords*.
