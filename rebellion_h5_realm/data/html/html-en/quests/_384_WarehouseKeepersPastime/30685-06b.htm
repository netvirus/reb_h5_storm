As Cliff told you, you must slay the *rottinggolem, the gigantic monster eyes, the konzur bat, the konzur bat lord,the tulben, the hunter gargoyle, the dragon bearer chief, the dragonbearer warrior, the dragon bearer archer, the dustwind gargoyle, thethunder wyrm, the carinkain, the weird drake, the grave guard, thecadeine, the sanhidro, the connabi, the bartal, the luminun, theinnersen, the nightmare guide, the nightmare keeper, and the nightmarelord* and bring back the *Warehouse Keeper's Medals* they stole.<br1>
Then,like Cliff, I will also let you *play bingo*.<br1>
I feel somewhatresponsible for the shoddy security provided for the freight wagon, andhave decided to help with the recovery of the medals.<br1>
If you win, I'llgive you an unclaimed item as a reward! You never know.<br1>
you may obtaina high-quality weapon or armor! According to our rules, *you can beteither 10 or 100 medals*.<br1>
Therefore, you should bring back at least 10medals.<br1>
If you bet 100 medals, you will have a better chance of winninga higher-quality item.<br1>
