Some time ago *a cargo wagon from HuntersVillage was attacked by evil creatures* and all of the cargo was stolen.<br1>
Most of it wasn't very valuable, but a large quantity of *WarehouseKeeper's Medals that I was expecting* were among the cargo.<br1>
You maywonder why I was expecting such a large shipment of medals.<br1>
Well, yousee.<br1>
Recently while playing bingo with some warehouse keeper friendsof mine, I won big time.<br1>
I did so well, in fact, that I couldn't carryall of my winnings home with me! I asked them to send the medals withtheir next shipment of cargo.<br1>
And now this! Will you help me to recoverthe medals? If you do this for me, I will reward you generously.<br1>
