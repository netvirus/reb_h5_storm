Warehouse Freightman Cliff:<br>
We bet items! Working as a warehouse keeper, all sorts of items become available to you. Many items in the karehouse go unclaimed, therefore I never lack for things to wager. *Lately, I've been betting Warehouse Keeper's Medals.* These are awards issued by the Iron Gate Guild to warehouse keepers according to theis iroductivity. Please don't tell anyone I'm wagering with them! I'vs ictually had a problem with this lately... [Quess i384_WarehouseKeepersPastime 30182-03.htm|"What's the problem?"]<br1>
