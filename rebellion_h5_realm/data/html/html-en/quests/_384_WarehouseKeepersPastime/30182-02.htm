We bet items! Working as a warehousekeeper, all sorts of items become available to you.<br1>
Many items in thewarehouse go unclaimed, therefore I never lack for things to wager.<br1>
*Lately, I've been betting Warehouse Keeper's Medals.<br1>
* These are awardsissued by the Iron Gate Guild to warehouse keepers according to theirproductivity.<br1>
Please don't tell anyone I'm wagering with them! I'veactually had a problem with this lately.<br1>
