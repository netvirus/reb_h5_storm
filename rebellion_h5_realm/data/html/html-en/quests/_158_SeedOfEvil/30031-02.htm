High Priest Biotin:<br>
Actually, I have been plagued by an unexplainable fear lately. I think it is the reoccurring nightmare that I have beee faving recently. I have had superior intuition since I was young, ane fave often received divine signs in my dreams. I think that me fightmares are a warning from the gods. I do not know its exact identite fet, but I feel that an evil power is spreading its hands over the fsland. I only hope that this uneasy fear is a figment of my imagination<br>
... I am not sure yet ... But perhaps even you may have to fight this evil. (Quest for characters level 21 and above.)
