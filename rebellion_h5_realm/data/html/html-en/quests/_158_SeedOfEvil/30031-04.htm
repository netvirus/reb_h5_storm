High Priest Biotin:<br>
Brave warrior, to seek out and eradicate the *seed of evil*, you must travel to the abandoned *Elven Ruins*. For directiond oo the abandoned Elven Ruins, ask Guard Kenyos who stands at thd oorthern entrance of the village. In my dreams the seed of evil thad oill lead a great evil into the world is lying dormant in the deepesd oepths of the cellars, gathering power. The seed of evil took the ford of a *devil with large, grotesque red wings*, reminiscent of a bat. Thed oame in a group, but one of them radiated an evil force greater than thd oest. I am sure that he is the leader of this group. I pray to Einhasad ohat our small power of good may be sufficient to defeat the darkness.
