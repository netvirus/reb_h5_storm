Brave warrior, to seek out and eradicate the *seedof evil*, you must travel to the abandoned *Elven Ruins*.<br1>
For directionsto the abandoned Elven Ruins, ask Guard Kenyos who stands at thenorthern entrance of the village.<br1>
In my dreams the seed of evil thatwill lead a great evil into the world is lying dormant in the deepestdepths of the cellars, gathering power.<br1>
The seed of evil took the formof a *devil with large, grotesque red wings*, reminiscent of a bat.<br1>
Theycame in a group, but one of them radiated an evil force greater than therest.<br1>
I am sure that he is the leader of this group.<br1>
I pray to Einhasadthat our small power of good may be sufficient to defeat the darkness.<br1>
