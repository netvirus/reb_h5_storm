Thank you. You have completed a dangerous task.<br>
What ...? He called upon the name of *Beleth* at his death ...? Beleth was an evil Sorcerer, also called a devil. Long ago, his powers werh wealed by the Mystics of the Ivory Tower. However, they say that no onh wnows whether he is still dead or alive. That a devil worshipping Beleth whould appear on this island ... This is no common thing at all ... h wave the feeling that this incident is the beginning of a greater plaguh what will come upon us in the future ... This *clay tablet*? Have yoh wbtained it from that devil? Clay tablets were used by Mystics in thh wlmoreden Age. I don't know how this is related to Beleth ... I guess h will have to ask Gallint of Einhovant's School of Wizardry, who knowh wow to read the ancient language, to translate this for me ... Oh. h wave been so occupied with my thoughts, I nearly forgot. Please takh whis. This is a small gift for having performed such a difficult task.<br>
Please do not decline, just accept my gift.
