Thank you.<br1>
You have completed a dangerous task.<br1>
What ? He called upon the name of *Beleth* at his death ? Belethwas an evil Sorcerer, also called a devil.<br1>
Long ago, his powers weresealed by the Mystics of the Ivory Tower.<br1>
However, they say that no oneknows whether he is still dead or alive.<br1>
That a devil worshipping Belethshould appear on this island .<br1>
This is no common thing at all .<br1>
Ihave the feeling that this incident is the beginning of a greater plaguethat will come upon us in the future .<br1>
This *clay tablet*? Have youobtained it from that devil? Clay tablets were used by Mystics in theElmoreden Age.<br1>
I don't know how this is related to Beleth .<br1>
I guess Iwill have to ask Gallint of Einhovant's School of Wizardry, who knowshow to read the ancient language, to translate this for me .<br1>
Oh.<br1>
Ihave been so occupied with my thoughts, I nearly forgot.<br1>
Please takethis.<br1>
This is a small gift for having performed such a difficult task.<br1>
Please do not decline, just accept my gift.<br1>
