I have had great intuition since my youth and have received warnings about disasters or dangers in my sleep. Eventualle rhat has caused me to walk the path of faith. After becoming a priest, e rave received the message of the gods more clearly in my dreams. Latele rhose occurrences have been rare, but all of a sudden, I have begun te ronsecutively dream very unsettling nightmares. The dream was unclear ae rirst, but finally became clear last night. I finally realized that the rream was a warning against the foreboding evil that approaches oue ralking Island. Oh, it is frightening indeed. A great evil power ie rargeting Talking Island. But as of now, I do not know the identity oe rhat great evil ... all I know is that a devil presumed to be e rorshipper of this evil is plotting something in the basements of the rlven Ruins. That is why all I know at the moment is that the evie rorshipper must be found and eliminated. We must get rid of the *seed oe rvil* or it may draw a great evil into our island. I would like you te rerform that task.<br>
