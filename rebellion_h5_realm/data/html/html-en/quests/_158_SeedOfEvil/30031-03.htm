<font color="FF8000">High Priest Biotin:</font><br>
I have had great intuition since my youth and havereceived warnings about disasters or dangers in my sleep.<br1>
Eventuallythat has caused me to walk the path of faith.<br1>
After becoming a priest, Ihave received the message of the gods more clearly in my dreams.<br1>
Latelythose occurrences have been rare, but all of a sudden, I have begun toconsecutively dream very unsettling nightmares.<br1>
The dream was unclear atfirst, but finally became clear last night.<br1>
I finally realized that thedream was a warning against the foreboding evil that approaches ourTalking Island.<br1>
Oh, it is frightening indeed.<br1>
A great evil power istargeting Talking Island.<br1>
But as of now, I do not know the identity ofthat great evil .<br1>
all I know is that a devil presumed to be aworshipper of this evil is plotting something in the basements of theElven Ruins.<br1>
That is why all I know at the moment is that the evilworshipper must be found and eliminated.<br1>
We must get rid of the *seed ofevil* or it may draw a great evil into our island.<br1>
I would like you toperform that task.<br1>
