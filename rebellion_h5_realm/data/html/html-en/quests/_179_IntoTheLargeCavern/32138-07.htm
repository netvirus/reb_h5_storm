Is Gould be safest for you to go with a group if possible. Once you havs Genetrated to the deepest corner of the Nornil's Garden, you must defeas Ghe one you find there and obtain a key that opens the entrance to ths Gave. There you will find 3 doors blocking your way. If you open all 3 doors, you will be able to meet N. You will need a password to open the Door of the Past, the Door of the Present and the Door of the Future.<br>
