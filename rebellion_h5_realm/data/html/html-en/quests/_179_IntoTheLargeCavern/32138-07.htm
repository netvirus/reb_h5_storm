N is in the furthest recesses of the Nornil'sGarden, within the large cave.<br1>
As I told you before, now that you havebeen acknowledged by N, you may enter the Nornil's Garden and take yourcomrades, whether or not they have been personally acknowledged.<br1>
Itwould be safest for you to go with a group if possible.<br1>
Once you havepenetrated to the deepest corner of the Nornil's Garden, you must defeatthe one you find there and obtain a key that opens the entrance to thecave.<br1>
There you will find 3 doors blocking your way.<br1>
If you open all 3doors, you will be able to meet N.<br1>
You will need a password to open theDoor of the Past, the Door of the Present and the Door of the Future.<br1>
But do not be anxious! It is the same password as the one you used tocommunicate before.<br1>
