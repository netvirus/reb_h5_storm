It is said that the Remains of Alder are placed here inEinhasad's shrine of this village.<br1>
If only we could acquire the remains,we would be able to summon the spirit of Alder from hell through anexorcism ritual.<br1>
Then we could ask him where he had hidden the copy ofthe revelation.<br1>
Recently , brother Metheus contacted us .<br1>
He told usthat he can hand over the Remains of Alder which are placed in theshrine.<br1>
First go and meet *Brother Metheus*.<br1>
He is in *Einhasad'sshrine* of this village.<br1>
