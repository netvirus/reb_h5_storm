That is what I heard from my grandmother when I wasyoung.<br1>
She told me to remember it until my dying day, and be sure topass it on to my children.<br1>
I couldn't understand the meaning exactly,but I could feel that it was talking about something very important.<br1>
Shesaid that if someone comes to me and says those words, I must give thisthing to that person.<br1>
