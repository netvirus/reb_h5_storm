<font color="FF8000">Brother Metheus:</font><br>
Come in, Dark Elf.<br1>
Do you know why I've asked youhere? Once I had a beloved sister.<br1>
She was the only family I had left.<br1>
She was executed during the rebellion of farmers because of herrelationship with the Bishops.<br1>
And this after she was excommunicated!The High Priest said that her soul would be damned and her body couldnot be buried in consecrated ground! Einhasad teaches forgiveness andmercy but I cannot suppress the furious sadness of my heart.<br1>
I must haverevenge on those who killed my sister! If you will help me avenge mysister, I will take the skull of Brother Alders from the crypt in thetemple.<br1>
There are 2 things with which I need your help.<br1>
First, *find theremains of my sister in the Execution Ground.<br1>
* Her body hangs from thebranches of a tree.<br1>
This is no normal tree, but a fearsome creature theundead call *Hanged Man Ripper*.<br1>
Once you retrieve my sister's remains,put them in this pot and bring them to me.<br1>
