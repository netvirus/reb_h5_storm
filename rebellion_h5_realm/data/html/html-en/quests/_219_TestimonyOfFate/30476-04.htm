At last, there is some report on *'Kaisha'sRevelation'*which was thought to be lost.<br1>
Although the religiousreformation by Humans distorted many facts about Goddess Shilen, thisrevelation contains the truth about Goddess Shilen written in the Giantages.<br1>
If only we could find the revelation, we would be able to have abetter understanding of the Goddess and the power of death from which itgenerates.<br1>
Doubtless, the original scroll of the revelation has beendestroyed.<br1>
But the copy of the revelation is being handed down untilthis day.<br1>
Do you know about Hornius the Human Scholar from the imperialera? It is said that he was killed by the believers of Einhasad duringhis research on Kaisha's Revelation.<br1>
But they say that one of the pupilshad made a copy of the revelation.<br1>
The name of the pupil is Alder.<br1>
Heused to be a brother belonging to the shrine.<br1>
At the Inquisition, hesaved himself from being burned at the stake by swearing that he wouldconvert to Einhasad.<br1>
But according to the recently found reminiscencesof Alder, he believed that Kaisha's Revelation was an important sourceof historical research and, therefore, secretly made a copy and hid itsomewhere.<br1>
We must find that.<br1>
