Belladonna? Of course I can make it for you.<br1>
But first youmust find me the materials.<br1>
The things that I need are *Medusa Blood,Marsh Spider Fluids, Dead Seeker Dung, Paagrio Crusader's Blood, andNightshade Root*.<br1>
I need *10 each*.<br1>
Dead Seeker bat can be found in theexecution ground of Dion, and Paagrio Crusader is in the Wastelands ofGludio.<br1>
And the Nightshade Root can be obtained from the stakatos ofCruma Marshlands.<br1>
I will make a list of it and once you find everythingon the list come back to me.<br1>
