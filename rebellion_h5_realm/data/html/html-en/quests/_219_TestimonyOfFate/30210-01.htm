I remember.<br1>
I've read it in an old accountbook.<br1>
We Dwarves are very strict on keeping the account book.<br1>
It isrecorded that when my predecessor first came here to the town'swarehouse, a pale looking man with a priest gown left a scroll with him.<br1>
It is the Steel Gate Guild's principle to protect all deposited thingsthoroughly, so we have kept the scroll in the locker for the last 200years.<br1>
Although your chit that you brought is also very old, there is nodoubt that it is issued by our warehouse.<br1>
Wait a moment.<br1>
I shall bringthe deposited goods.<br1>
Here! Take it.<br1>
I am telling you, some pages in thisbook are torn .<br1>
