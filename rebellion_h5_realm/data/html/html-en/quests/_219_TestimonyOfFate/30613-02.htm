This is a copy of Kaisha's Revelation, ancientreligious scriptures that I transcribed at great risk to my life.<br1>
I willsafeguard it for future generations.<br1>
Although it is dark elves who nowseek its secrets, I find it rewarding that such an old truth is againknown to the world.<br1>
You may obtain a written copy of the revelation fromGludin's warehouse.<br1>
First you must obtain a bill from my daughter'*Roa*' who lives in this village.<br1>
Go to her and say '*The moon emitslight though you hide it with your hand*.<br1>
' She will then give you thebill.<br1>
