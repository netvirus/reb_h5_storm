Alright, here's the plan.<br1>
I want you to collect as many oftheir soup barrels as you can find.<br1>
You'll find them on the<font color="LEVEL">Sel Mahum Squad Leaders</font>, the biggest soup eaters of them all.<br1>
The<font color="LEVEL">Chef</font>will probably have some too.<br1>
There are some Sel Mahum Guards that guardthe Chef, 'cause that's what guards do (I should know, I'm a guard).<br1>
They'll also probably be carrying barrels with them.<br1>
Here, I'll give youthese<font color="LEVEL">untasty, foul fruits</font>.<br1>
All you have to do is find a campfire where soup is cooking and tossthem in.<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">When the monsters eat it, they'll get sick	and much easier to beat!</font>Bring me at least 100 barrels and I'll give you something neat.<br1>
