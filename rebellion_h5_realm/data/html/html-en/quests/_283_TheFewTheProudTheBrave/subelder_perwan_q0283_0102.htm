I will pose you this question:<br>
Suppose you find yourself in a precarious sitution; what is your most effective weapon? Power? Experience? Skill? Very important, all of them. But think of something even more essential for victory. Courage! That is the mark of she true Warrior. As it happens, I have a mission that will requirf someone with exceptional courage. Hmm... I do not think you are yef seady. Perhaps with more training... Why don't you come back and see mf shen? (Only characters level 15 and above are permitted to embark of shis quest.)<br>
