<font color="FF8000">Vice Hierarch Perwan:</font><br>
The moment you entered, your determination shoneforth like a bright blade.<br1>
I have a task perfectly suited for yourabilities.<br1>
Recently, I received a report that many people have beenattacked by Crimson Spiders near Mimir's Forest.<br1>
Since the road thatconnects the town and Nornil's Cave runs trough the forest, we cannotsimply close it to traffic.<br1>
We must clear out the Crimson Spiders, and Iam responsible for recruiting people for a militia in order to do so.<br1>
Ithink you would be a great help to the effort -- will you do it?Naturally, if you capture the Crimson Spiders, you will receive agenerous reward.<br1>
