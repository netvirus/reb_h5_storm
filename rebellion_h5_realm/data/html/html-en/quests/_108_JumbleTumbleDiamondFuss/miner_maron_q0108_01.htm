Elven wine ? A gift from Torocco? Oh my .<br1>
This giftis great, but .<br1>
he's going to have to fix that bad drinking habit ofhis .<br1>
I'm always worried that Torocco might start trouble whiledrinking .<br1>
Whew .<br1>
I am worried about him .<br1>
My friend, Torocco, isa fine, steady lad, but .<br1>
He has two bad habits .<br1>
One is drinking.<br1>
.<br1>
And the other is gambling  We were drinking together lastnight .<br1>
Then, *Blacksmith Brunon* suggested we gamble with dice .<br1>
Itold him not to .<br1>
but Torocco just couldn't resist the temptation, andstarted to roll the dice .<br1>
These exact dice here .<br1>
He was very drunkand lost everything he had .<br1>
Whew .<br1>
He may be my friend, but I'mvery ashamed of him .<br1>
