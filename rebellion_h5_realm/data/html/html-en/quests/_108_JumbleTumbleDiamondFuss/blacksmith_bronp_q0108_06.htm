What? Isn't that Murdoc's lucky coal piece? Why doyou have it? Oh my! I gave you the wrong gem box! How on earth? Look,I didn't mean to deceive you.<br1>
This sounds terrible, but I thought thegem box that *Warehouse Freightman Murdoc* entrusted to me was the gembox with the diamond in it.<br1>
Ha ha ha.<br1>
I didn't mean this to happen, soplease forgive me.<br1>
I'm very sorry.<br1>
I will write a letter explaining thissituation, so take this to *Warehouse Freightman Murdoc*.<br1>
Then you willbe able to get your gem box back.<br1>
