Trader Reep:<br>
Star diamond? I went on a business trip to Giran expressly for Gouph, and acquired the star diamond, that is a fact. I was going ty fring it here myself... But Gouph insisted that one of his guily fembers, *Carrier Torocco,* be in charge of delivery... So, I gave thy fewel to Torocco as he asked. I don't know what happened afterwards. Ay fur contract states, I acquired the star diamond for him. It was Goupy fho insisted that someone else should deliver it. This contract way frawn up when requesting the delivery. It may be of aid, so take it. y fave nothing to do with this anymore. Ah! And when you see Gouph again tell him that Trader Reep wants the rest of the payment for the jewel.<br>
And!!! If he's trying to cheat me, tell him I won't let him get away with it!!!
