Star diamond? I went on a business trip to Giran expresslyfor Gouph, and acquired the star diamond, that is a fact.<br1>
I was going tobring it here myself.<br1>
But Gouph insisted that one of his guildmembers, *Carrier Torocco,* be in charge of delivery.<br1>
So, I gave thejewel to Torocco as he asked.<br1>
I don't know what happened afterwards.<br1>
Asour contract states, I acquired the star diamond for him.<br1>
It was Gouphwho insisted that someone else should deliver it.<br1>
This contract wasdrawn up when requesting the delivery.<br1>
It may be of aid, so take it.<br1>
Ihave nothing to do with this anymore.<br1>
Ah! And when you see Gouph again,tell him that Trader Reep wants the rest of the payment for the jewel.<br1>
