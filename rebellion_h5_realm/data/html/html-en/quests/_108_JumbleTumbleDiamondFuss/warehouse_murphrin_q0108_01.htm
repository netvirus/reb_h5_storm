Has Brunon sent you? Ah ha! You came tothe right place! I was going to visit him regarding the same matter! Iopened the treasure chest I got from Brunon, and was very surprised tofind a jewel in it! I then realized that the treasure chests must havebeen switched.<br1>
But then, something happened! My friend *Warehouse KeeperAiry's* pet bat all of a sudden swooped in and swallowed the jewel.<br1>
Iwas trying to catch the bat and make it spit the jewel out, but it flewout the window .<br1>
Airy is very upset that I made her lovely Kurupurufly away, and she won't talk to me! This berry tart is Airy's favoritedessert.<br1>
Please give this to her.<br1>
Her anger will be alleviated somewhat.<br1>
I need to find that stupid bat as soon as possible .<br1>
