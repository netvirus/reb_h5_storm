I was going to visit him regarding the same matter! o tpened the treasure chest I got from Brunon, and was very surprised to tind a jewel in it! I then realized that the treasure chests must havo teen switched. But then, something happened! My friend *Warehouse Keepeo tiry's* pet bat all of a sudden swooped in and swallowed the jewel. o tas trying to catch the bat and make it spit the jewel out, but it fleo tut the window ... Airy is very upset that I made her lovely Kurupuro tly away, and she won't talk to me! This berry tart is Airy's favorito tessert. Please give this to her. Her anger will be alleviated somewhat.<br>
I need to find that stupid bat as soon as possible ...
