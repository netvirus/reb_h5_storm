Why have you come back? Didn't I tell you? I don't havethe star diamond!!! The last person who had the jewel was *CarrierTorocco*.<br1>
If you find him, show him the contract I gave you and ask himwhy the delivery is taking so long.<br1>
I have nothing to do with thisanymore, so don't come back to me again.<br1>
