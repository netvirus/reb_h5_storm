Oooh! You've finally found it! My star diamond .<br1>
!Heh, heh, heh .<br1>
Give it to me now! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!You've done well, young friend.<br1>
As promised, I will give you a reward.<br1>
Here, take this weapon.<br1>
This hammer was used by silversmiths from theElmoreden period.<br1>
I got it from Gracia a few days ago, and what do youknow, they say that someone stole it from the personal vaults of CountBoldstone and smuggled it here .<br1>
As I hold a public position as one ofthe leaders of the guild, it is not good for me to have smuggled goodsin my possession .<br1>
So feel free to take it! You can use it or sell it.<br1>
