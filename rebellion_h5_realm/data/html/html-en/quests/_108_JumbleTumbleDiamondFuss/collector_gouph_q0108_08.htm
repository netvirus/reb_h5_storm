You've done well, young friend. As promised, I will give you a reward.<br>
Here, take this weapon. This hammer was used by silversmiths from the Elmoreden period. I got it from Gracia a few days ago, and what do yoe Enow, they say that someone stole it from the personal vaults of Coune Eoldstone and smuggled it here ... As I hold a public position as one oe Ehe leaders of the guild, it is not good for me to have smuggled goode En my possession ... So feel free to take it! You can use it or sell it.<br>
It's up to you!
