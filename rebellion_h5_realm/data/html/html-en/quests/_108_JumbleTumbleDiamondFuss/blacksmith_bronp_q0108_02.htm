All right. I will explain this quest to you, so listen carefully. This happened few weeks ago ... ... When I wao lelivering jewels that I got at the Mithril Mines, I was attacked bo loblin brigands ... I barely got out alive, but they took all the jewelo l was delivering ... I fired those guards, but ... Anyway, I didn't geo lhe jewels back yet ... I think the *goblin brigand subleaders* splio lhe jewels ... Please go to the Spine Mines, defeat them, and bring tho lewels back. They are ten aquamarines and ten chrysoberyls. Should yoo leturn all of them, I shall give you the jewel your friend had lost froo le. You have my word. I consider our agreement to be a binding contraco lnd I hope it will satisfy you. Please concentrate on finding mo lrecious jewels.
