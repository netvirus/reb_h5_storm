All right.<br1>
I will explain this quest to you, solisten carefully.<br1>
This happened few weeks ago  When I wasdelivering jewels that I got at the Mithril Mines, I was attacked bygoblin brigands .<br1>
I barely got out alive, but they took all the jewelsI was delivering .<br1>
I fired those guards, but .<br1>
Anyway, I didn't getthe jewels back yet .<br1>
I think the *goblin brigand subleaders* splitthe jewels .<br1>
Please go to the Spine Mines, defeat them, and bring thejewels back.<br1>
They are ten aquamarines and ten chrysoberyls.<br1>
Should youreturn all of them, I shall give you the jewel your friend had lost fromme.<br1>
You have my word.<br1>
I consider our agreement to be a binding contractand I hope it will satisfy you.<br1>
Please concentrate on finding myprecious jewels.<br1>
