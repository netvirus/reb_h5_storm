I received the star diamond at Giran .<br1>
.<br1>
and drew acontract with Reep .<br1>
I told him that I would be responsible fordelivery .<br1>
Everything was great when I was traveling .<br1>
And I gothere, Kingdom of the Dwarves, last night .<br1>
I drank with my old friend,*Miner Maron* .<br1>
We have been friends ever since we were very young .<br1>
When we meet once in awhile, we have the bad habit of drinking until wepass out  and we had quite a bit to drink last night .<br1>
But whenI woke up in the morning, I found that my weapons, equipment, travelmoney, and the box where I put the star diamond were missing .<br1>
! Idon't know what could have happened .<br1>
Agghhhhh .<br1>
! However .<br1>
Perhaps my friend Maron remembers something about last night .<br1>
But hepaid for the drinks last night, as well as for the tables and chairs Ibroke .<br1>
I'm too ashamed to meet him .<br1>
Why don't you go to the *stripmine* and ask him? Give this wine to Maron for me .<br1>
This is a rarewine I brought for him from Giran as a present .<br1>
