Well done.<br1>
I must gather our old bronze swords and sendthem to *Blacksmith Karrod*.<br1>
They will be used to make useful items,such as armor or shields.<br1>
Our motto is to reward even the most minusculeof tasks.<br1>
Please accept this as payment for your work on behalf of mysisters and me.<br1>
May the blessings of Shilen be with you until we meetagain.<br1>
