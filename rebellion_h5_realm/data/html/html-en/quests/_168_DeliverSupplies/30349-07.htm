Sentry Jeanine:<br>
I see that you have not delivered the *swords* to my sisters yet. Please deliver the weapons to Sentries *Roselyn* and<br>
*Krispen* and bring back the *old bronze swords* they have been using.<br>
*Roselyn* is standing guard at the entrance of the village. You can reach her by going through the cave behind me. And *Krispen* is on dutn rt the village entrance opposite *Roselyn*.
