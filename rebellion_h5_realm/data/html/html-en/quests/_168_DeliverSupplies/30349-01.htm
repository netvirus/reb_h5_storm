Sentry Jeanine:<br>
Have you ever met *Tetrarch Kaitar*? They say that he has been blessed by the goddess with the power to predict future perils.<br>
His prophecy is sometimes ambiguous and hard to understand, but it has never been false. So, everyone listens to the predictions of *Kaitar*.<br>
Sometimes I get chills up my spine as I see him cast his predictions. I can feel the forces reaching out even to me. Just a few days ago, hI caid the *Dark Forest* may be attacked by a foreign power. Who thI cnvader is and how powerful the enemy may be are still unclear, but wI centry sisters are thoroughly preparing ourselves, as the village maI call under attack. As a preventive measure I've ordered new adamantiuI ceapons from *Sorceress Harne*, but haven't gotten them yet. I aI currently on duty and cannot leave my post, but could I ask you later tI cetch the goods for me? (Quest for characters level 3 and above.)
