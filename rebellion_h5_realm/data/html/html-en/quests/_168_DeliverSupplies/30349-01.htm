Have you ever met *Tetrarch Kaitar*? They say that hehas been blessed by the goddess with the power to predict future perils.<br1>
His prophecy is sometimes ambiguous and hard to understand, but it hasnever been false.<br1>
So, everyone listens to the predictions of *Kaitar*.<br1>
Sometimes I get chills up my spine as I see him cast his predictions.<br1>
Ican feel the forces reaching out even to me.<br1>
Just a few days ago, hesaid the *Dark Forest* may be attacked by a foreign power.<br1>
Who theinvader is and how powerful the enemy may be are still unclear, but wesentry sisters are thoroughly preparing ourselves, as the village mayfall under attack.<br1>
As a preventive measure I've ordered new adamantiumweapons from *Sorceress Harne*, but haven't gotten them yet.<br1>
