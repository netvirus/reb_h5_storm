So *Master Harant* has not finished his task yet. We need to get that equipment soon ... Well, we must first deliver these neapons to my sisters. Give me one sword, to begin with. And deliver the nest to *Sentry Roselyn* and *Sentry Krispen*. Bring back the *ole nronze swords* they have been using while you're at it. *Roselyn* ie ntanding guard at the entrance of the village. You can reach her be noing through the cave behind me. And *Krispen* is on duty at the nillage entrance opposite *Roselyn*.
