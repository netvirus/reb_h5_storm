Ah, so *Jeanine* sent you.<br1>
The new weapons for thesentries have been finished.<br1>
This is all thanks to *Blacksmith Karrod*,who has worked day and night to finish them.<br1>
These are prime swordscrafted of adamantite.<br1>
But I have not finished the task of casting magicon these weapons.<br1>
Well, it's not anything elaborate, just magic thatmakes the sword a little bit lighter and the blade a little bit sharper.<br1>
I need more time to finish my task .<br1>
But since *Jeanine* seems soanxious, go and deliver these *three swords* that are finished.<br1>
And giveher regards from *Master Harant*.<br1>
