Master Harant:<br>
Ah, so *Jeanine* sent you. The new weapons for the sentries have been finished. This is all thanks to *Blacksmith Karrod* who has worked day and night to finish them. These are prime swords crafted of adamantite. But I have not finished the task of casting magis cn these weapons. Well, it's not anything elaborate, just magic thas cakes the sword a little bit lighter and the blade a little bit sharper.<br>
I need more time to finish my task ... But since *Jeanine* seems so anxious, go and deliver these *three swords* that are finished. And givo aer regards from *Master Harant*.
