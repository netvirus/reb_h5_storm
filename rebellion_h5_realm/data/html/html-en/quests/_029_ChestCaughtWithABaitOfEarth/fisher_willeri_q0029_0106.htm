Welcome back! You've already finished,<br>
eh? No? Well, I don't have all day, buddy! Bring me the *small purple treasure box*. I realize it's like looking for a needle in a haystack,<br>
but I'm counting on you! Maybe you should ask around in the market...<br>
Someone may have already found it!
