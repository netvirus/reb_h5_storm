A while back someone was here askingabout a a *small purple treasure box*.<br1>
The bait that I gave you beforewas designed to find it.<br1>
The problem is that the bait occasionallycatches other things, but it's the best hope you have of recovering thebox.<br1>
If you've found the box, please give it to me.<br1>
If not, I must askyou to go and find it for me.<br1>
I apologize for being untruthful earlier.<br1>
The bait works better if the fisherman doesn't know about itsproperties.<br1>
Bring me the *small purple treasure box* and I'll tell youwho it belongs to! He lost it near the shore.<br1>
Look for it there.<br1>
Remember, your fishing skill must be level 16, and you must bring thebox to me unopened.<br1>
Someone else may have already found it, so askaround in the market.<br1>
