Fishermen's Guild Member Willie:<br>
A while back someone was here asking about a a *small purple treasure box*. The bait that I gave you beforg aas designed to find it. The problem is that the bait occasionallg aatches other things, but it's the best hope you have of recovering thg aox. If you've found the box, please give it to me. If not, I must asg aou to go and find it for me. I apologize for being untruthful earlier.<br>
The bait works better if the fisherman doesn't know about its properties. Bring me the *small purple treasure box* and I'll tell yos pho it belongs to! He lost it near the shore. Look for it there.<br>
Remember, your fishing skill must be level 16, and you must bring the box to me unopened. Someone else may have already found it, so ase bround in the market.
