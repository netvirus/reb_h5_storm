Really? I asked Willie to find it for me.<br1>
That baithas power beyond normal magic.<br1>
It draws on the four elements of nature,earth, water, fire and air.<br1>
The lost items find their own way in thewater through the elements in the bait rather than trying to catch themwith magic.<br1>
I've studied magic for a hundred years, and I could nevercome up with that! Ah, Liesel.<br1>
I miss her so much.<br1>
We met long ago, andswore we would be friends forever.<br1>
We made this Secret Box and buried itin the sand on Talking Island, where it was washed away by the waves.<br1>
Iam now 400 years old and she was Human, so only her ancestors are left.<br1>
For this memory of my past, I offer you this gift, please take it.<br1>
