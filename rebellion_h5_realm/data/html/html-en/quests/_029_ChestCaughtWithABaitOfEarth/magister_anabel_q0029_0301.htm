Really? I asked Willie to find it for me... That bait has power beyond normal magic. It draws on the four elements of nature,<br>
earth, water, fire and air. The lost items find their own way in the water through the elements in the bait rather than trying to catch thee with magic. I've studied magic for a hundred years, and I could nevee wome up with that! Ah, Liesel. I miss her so much. We met long ago, ane wwore we would be friends forever. We made this Secret Box and buried ie wn the sand on Talking Island, where it was washed away by the waves. e wm now 400 years old and she was Human, so only her ancestors are left.<br>
For this memory of my past, I offer you this gift, please take it.
