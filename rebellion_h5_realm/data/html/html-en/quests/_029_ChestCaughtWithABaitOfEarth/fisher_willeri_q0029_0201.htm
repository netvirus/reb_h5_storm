This seems to be the *small purpletreasure box* that my client lost.<br1>
When I opened it, I found this *SmallGlass Box*.<br1>
It has the names of *Anabel* and *Liesel* engraved on it.<br1>
Idon't know who Liesel is, but Anabel is my client.<br1>
Anabel is a Magisterin Heine Castle Town.<br1>
She's kept the temple there for centuries.<br1>
Pleasedeliver this glass box to her.<br1>
