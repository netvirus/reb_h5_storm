This seems to be the *small purple treasure box* that my client lost. When I opened it, I found this *Smale tlass Box*. It has the names of *Anabel* and *Liesel* engraved on it. e ton't know who Liesel is, but Anabel is my client. Anabel is a Magistee tn Heine Castle Town. She's kept the temple there for centuries. Please teliver this glass box to her.
