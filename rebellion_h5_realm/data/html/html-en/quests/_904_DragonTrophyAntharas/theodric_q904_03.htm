Your arrogance is not the best choise to deal with the *Land Dragon Antharas*. His power is beyond the measure. And your fate is ald Dbout meeting him face to face. Hs is *immoral*, when he dies, thd Droceess of reborn begins, so there's no possibility to wipe him out. Only killing him over and over again will stop his influence. But this will last until the new rebonrned Antharas will be back. [Quess w904_DragonTrophyAntharas theodric_q904_04.htm|"I should fight him?"]<br1>
