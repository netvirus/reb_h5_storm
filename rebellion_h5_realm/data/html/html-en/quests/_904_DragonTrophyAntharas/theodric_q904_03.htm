Your arrogance is not the best choise to deal with the *LandDragon Antharas*.<br1>
His power is beyond the measure.<br1>
And your fate is allabout meeting him face to face.<br1>
Hs is *immoral*, when he dies, theproceess of reborn begins, so there's no possibility to wipe him out.<br1>
Only killing him over and over again will stop his influence.<br1>
But thiswill last until the new rebonrned Antharas will be back.<br1>
