Ahh .<br1>
As I thought.<br1>
You are a kindheartedperson.<br1>
This is a letter I wrote to my family.<br1>
Take it.<br1>
There is no needfor you to travel all the way to the northern lands of the *DwarvenKingdom*.<br1>
Just deliver this to *Haprock*, a Dwarf in the *town ofGludio*.<br1>
He will send my letter along on the coach that goes to myhometown.<br1>
He will pay you as well.<br1>
He is a generous person, and willreward you handsomely.<br1>
