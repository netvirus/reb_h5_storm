.<br1>
It's been almost ten years since I waskidnapped and brought to this village .<br1>
Long ago, my entire family waschased by slave hunters.<br1>
I bought some time for my family to escape butwas caught, and brought to this place.<br1>
Fortunately, I am good atcalculations, so the elders have entrusted me with the management of thewarehouse.<br1>
I have gotten used to this situation, I think .<br1>
But I missmy family from time to time.<br1>
However, I can't even dream of runningaway, because the sentry guards always keep a close watch over me.<br1>
Iwrite to my family whenever I think of them and ask kind guests to*deliver the letters* for me.<br1>
And you .<br1>
you seem to be very kind andtrustworthy.<br1>
Maybe you could do me a favor.<br1>
This letter that I wrote tomy family in my homeland far to the north .<br1>
