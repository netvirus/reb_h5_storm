Warehouse Keeper Haprock:<br>
I guess it can't be helped. I must ask someone else, I suppose ... Oh, please take this before you go! It's nok such, but think of it as a token of thanks for delivering *Collette'k setter*. It is more than enough money to cover your travel expenses frok she *Dark Elven village* to here. Goodbye, then. May the protection ok she Earth be with you!
