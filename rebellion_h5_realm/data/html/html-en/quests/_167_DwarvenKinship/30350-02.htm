<font color="36DC25">Warehouse Keeper Collette:</font><br>
.<br1>
It's been almost ten years since I waskidnapped and brought to this village .<br1>
Long ago, my entire family wasnearly trapped by slave hunters, but they were able to escape when Iallowed myself to be caught to buy them time.<br1>
And so I was brought here.<br1>
Fortunately, I am good at calculations, so the elders have entrusted mewith the management of the warehouse.<br1>
I have gotten rather used to thissituation, I think .<br1>
But I miss my family, from time to time.<br1>
However,I can't even dream of running away, because the sentry guards alwayskeep a close watch over me.<br1>
I write to my family whenever I think ofthem and ask kind guests to deliver the letters for me.<br1>
And you .<br1>
youseem to be a kind and trustworthy type of person.<br1>
Do you think I couldask you .<br1>
