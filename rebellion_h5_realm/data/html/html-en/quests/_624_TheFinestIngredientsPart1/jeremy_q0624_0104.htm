The dish I shall make for the competition is called"Smoked Yeti.<br1>
" However, I cannot make it with ordinary Yeti meat; I needthe meat from the Icicle Emperor, the greatest of all the Yeti.<br1>
TheIcicle Emperor ventures out only rarely, however, so we must first cookanother meal as bait.<br1>
I will require the stems of Hot Springs Nepenthes,feet of Hot Springs Bandersnatchlings, Hot Springs Atroxes and HotSprings Atroxspawns.<br1>
I need you to fetch me 50 Secret Spices derivedfrom these materials.<br1>
Why so many? Not only this particular Yeti verylarge, he is also a very discriminating eater.<br1>
We must tease hispalate.<br1>
While you gather the spices, I will begun my preparationshere.<br1>
