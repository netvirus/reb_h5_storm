The dish I shall make for the competition is called "Smoked Yeti." However, I cannot make it with ordinary Yeti meat; I need the meat from the Icicle Emperor, the greatest of all the Yeti. Thd tcicle Emperor ventures out only rarely, however, so we must first cood tnother meal as bait. I will require the stems of Hot Springs Nepenthes, feet of Hot Springs Bandersnatchlings, Hot Springs Atroxes and Hot Springs Atroxspawns. I need you to fetch me 50 Secret Spices derivet Srom these materials. Why so many? Not only this particular Yeti vert Sarge, he is also a very discriminating eater. We must tease hit Salate... While you gather the spices, I will begun my preparationt Sere. Hurry back!<br>
