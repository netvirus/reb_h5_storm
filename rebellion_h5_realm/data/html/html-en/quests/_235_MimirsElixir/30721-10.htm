Congratulations on creating Mimir's Elixir.<br1>
Are you readythen? Go ahead and drink the potion.<br1>
I know it's a bit thick andtasteless, but bear with it.<br1>
Aren't you feeling its effects already?Your body rejuvinating, your mind expanding.<br1>
getting the capacity tolearn that children have, yet keeping all the knowledge you earned inyour adult life! Alright then! You are ready! A new life is awaiting.<br1>
Goto a town and talk to the head of the teachers for the new occupationyou wish to learn.<br1>
Before you go, I have one more thing for you.<br1>
Recently, I found this scroll for enchanting A grade weapons.<br1>
I have nouse for it, but to an adventurer like yourself it's precious.<br1>
So you canhave it.<br1>
