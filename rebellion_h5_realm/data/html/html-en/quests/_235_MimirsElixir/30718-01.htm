Are you the person Ladd sent for True Gold? I wasalready informed you were coming.<br1>
To tell you the truth, I do not reallyneed it any more, but seing how much you need it, how about a trade? Formy next experiment, I need the Stone of Wisdom.<br1>
Some also call it Sage'sStone.<br1>
It can only be acquired by killing *Chimera Piece*.<br1>
You can findthis monster in the Field of Silence, near Giant's Cave.<br1>
If you bring methis stone, I will give you some True Gold.<br1>
