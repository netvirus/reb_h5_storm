Ah, you are back with the pure silver and true gold!Good! You are almost ready to get Mimir's Elixit, but listen carefully!In order to create the elixir, you need to melt the two ingredients fastand perfectly.<br1>
Normal fires are not hot enough to achieve that.<br1>
Only*Blood fire* is hot enough to meld true gold and pure silver.<br1>
You canobtain Blood Fire by killing the bloody guardian in the Lair ofAntharas.<br1>
