I can't believe Balanki fell for it, you silver-tongued devil!<br1>
It's a wonder that you even survived, much less kept your Adena.<br1>
He must be losing his touch! Ha! You know, I think I like you! I'm going to help you, but you must pretend to do something in return in order to keep up appearances.<br1>
Balanki puts great emphasis on appearance, eh?<br1>
Did you see Priest of the Earth Gerald at the town entrance?<br1>
Give this to him -- he'll love it even more than I do.<br1>
Ask him who has acquired the right to strip mine Mithril.<br1>
This is a very sensitive matter, and I won't hold it against you if he doesn't answer.<br1>
But this is the price for my help...
