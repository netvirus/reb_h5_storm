I can't believe Balanki fell for it, yousilver-tongued devil! It's a wonder that you even survived, much lesskept your Adena.<br1>
He must be losing his touch! Ha! You know, I think Ilike you! I'm going to help you, but you must pretend to do something inreturn in order to keep up appearances.<br1>
Balanki puts great emphasis onappearance, eh? Did you see Priest of the Earth Gerald at the townentrance? Give this to him -- he'll love it even more than I do.<br1>
Ask himwho has acquired the right to strip mine Mithril.<br1>
This is a verysensitive matter, and I won't hold it against you if he doesn't answer.<br1>
But this is the price for my help.<br1>
