Balanki:<br>
You've got some nerve addressing an elder like that! So, you want to broaden your horizons, eh?<br1>
Ha! Even if you could afford to travel, Maphr couldn't keep you safe out there!<br1>
I admire your courage and ambition, but it takes more than those things to travel, my friend!<br1>
I'll tell you what! Pass a *test* that I give you and I'll pay yourway to Giran.<br1>
Do you understand?<br1>
All I ask is that you obtain the endorsement of *Warehouse Chief Reed*.<br1>
I must warn you, he's not easily impressed.<br1>
Now get going!!!
