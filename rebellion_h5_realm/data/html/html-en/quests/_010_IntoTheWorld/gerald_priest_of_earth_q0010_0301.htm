Very nice! Maphr should be pleased.<br1>
It's not from you, eh? I think I know who would send me this kind ofgift and ask you to find out such a thing.<br1>
Well, thanks for the gift,but I can't tell you who has the right to strip mine.<br1>
However, I willgive you a hint for the person who gave me this gift.<br1>
Tell him that theright to strip mine goes to whoever can afford to make enoughcontributions to Maphr, and whoever has enough wealth, popularity andvirtue to operate the mine.<br1>
Thank him for the gift and tell him to bringmy contributions for Maphr anytime.<br1>
