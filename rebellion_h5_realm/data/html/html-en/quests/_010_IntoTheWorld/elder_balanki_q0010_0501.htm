Damn that Reed!<br1>
He knows better than that...<br1>
Well, I suppost I'll do it since I gave you my word.<br1>
Your abilities may be suspect, but your luck is certainly holding out!<br1>
I've given you a scroll called *Scroll of Escape: Giran*.<br1>
Have you ever used a Scroll of Escape?<br1>
Double-click the scroll and it will take you to the village.<br1>
I've been saving this one for a special occasion!<br1>
This scroll allows you to go directly to Giran Castle Town, but it will only work once, so use it carefully!<br1>
I know you can't wait to get to the thriving metropolis of Giran, right? Ha!<br1>
I've also given you *the Mark of the Traveler*.<br1>
When you're ready to return to this village visit *Trader Galladucci at the Prestigious Items Hall*.<br1>
Show him this and he'll help you return here.<br1>
I pray that Maphr is always watching over you!
