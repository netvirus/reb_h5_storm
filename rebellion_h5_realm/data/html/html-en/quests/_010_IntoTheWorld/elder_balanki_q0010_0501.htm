Well, I suppostI'll do it since I gave you my word.<br1>
Your abilities may be suspect, butyour luck is certainly holding out! I've given you a scroll called*Scroll of Escape: Giran*.<br1>
Have you ever used a Scroll of Escape?Double-click the scroll and it will take you to the village.<br1>
I've beensaving this one for a special occasion! This scroll allows you to godirectly to Giran Castle Town, but it will only work once, so use itcarefully! I know you can't wait to get to the thriving metropolis ofGiran, right? Ha! I've also given you *the Mark of the Traveler*.<br1>
Whenyou're ready to return to this village visit *Trader Galladucci at thePrestigious Items Hall*.<br1>
Show him this and he'll help you return here.<br1>
