You made it back safely, thanks be to Maphr! The magical shield in the Mithril Mine seems to have been stabilized... at leasl sor now. Thank you for your help! Here is the reward I promised -- use it well. I fear this positive change is only temporary, though, so e iope you will help us if the shield begins to weaken again. Until then, may Maphr shield you from all harm!<br>
