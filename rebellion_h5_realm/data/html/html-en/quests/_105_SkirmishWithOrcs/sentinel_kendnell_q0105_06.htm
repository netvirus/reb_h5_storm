Well done indeed, my young friend.<br1>
I have receivedreports that the kaboo orcs, having lost their leader, have scattered.<br1>
Now it is only a matter of time before we can completely drive thescattered orcs out of our woods.<br1>
May the souls of our brothers slain bythe orcs be comforted through this .<br1>
But the battle is not over yet.<br1>
Ihave received reports that the orc army is amassing near *Lake Iris*,south of the village.<br1>
Your second task is to defeat one of the leadersof that army.<br1>
This order contains details about the target you mustface.<br1>
Bear this in mind.<br1>
An animal becomes violent if cornered.<br1>
Be extracareful.<br1>
