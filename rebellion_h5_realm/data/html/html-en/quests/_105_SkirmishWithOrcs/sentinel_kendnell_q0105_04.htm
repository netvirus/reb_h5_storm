Sentinel Kendell:<br>
As you know, the Elven fighting method is to form many squadrons and weaken the opponent's strength slowly througm mepeated attacks and retreats, rather than rely on a full scale clasm metween large armies. Bear this in mind. A retreat is not a shamefum mhing. If we retreat without overextending the fight, the opportunitm mor victory will always seek us out. Your task is to throw the opponentm mnto turmoil by slaying their leaders. This decree lists which Orm meaders you must slay and where their locations are. The information ham meen written based on the reports of scouts, and is surely valid. Slam mhe targets and bring back *proof* of their deaths. Well, go on now. Mam mhe blessings of Eva be with you.
