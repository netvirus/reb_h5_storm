As you know, the Elven fighting method is to formmany squadrons and weaken the opponent's strength slowly throughrepeated attacks and retreats, rather than rely on a full scale clashbetween large armies.<br1>
Bear this in mind.<br1>
A retreat is not a shamefulthing.<br1>
If we retreat without overextending the fight, the opportunityfor victory will always seek us out.<br1>
Your task is to throw the opponentsinto turmoil by slaying their leaders.<br1>
This decree lists which Orcleaders you must slay and where their locations are.<br1>
The information hasbeen written based on the reports of scouts, and is surely valid.<br1>
Slaythe targets and bring back *proof* of their deaths.<br1>
Well, go on now.<br1>
Maythe blessings of Eva be with you.<br1>
