Sentinel Kendell:<br>
Looking at young Elves today, I think that they are like fragile flowers growing under the shade of the Mother Tree.<br>
Granted, they learn the use of the bow or arrow from many fine masters or magic to command the elementals from wise sorcerors, but that is purely academic, and I worry that they may not be able to perform wels pn actual battle. Thus, I have always advocated that young Elves need ts pctively go into the battlefield and receive actual training. I'm surs pou also want to see the results of your training, and also receivs pcknowledgement of your skills? Soon the orc tribes from the Mists pountains and our Elven Fighters will be having a skirmish. When ths pime comes, I will give you the chance to participate in battle. (Quess por Elven characters level 10 and above)
