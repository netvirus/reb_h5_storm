Looking at young Elves today, I think that they arelike fragile flowers growing under the shade of the Mother Tree.<br1>
Granted, they learn the use of the bow or arrow from many fine masters,or magic to command the elementals from wise sorcerors, but that ispurely academic, and I worry that they may not be able to perform wellin actual battle.<br1>
Thus, I have always advocated that young Elves need toactively go into the battlefield and receive actual training.<br1>
I'm sureyou also want to see the results of your training, and also receiveacknowledgement of your skills? Soon the orc tribes from the MistyMountains and our Elven Fighters will be having a skirmish.<br1>
When thetime comes, I will give you the chance to participate in battle.<br1>
