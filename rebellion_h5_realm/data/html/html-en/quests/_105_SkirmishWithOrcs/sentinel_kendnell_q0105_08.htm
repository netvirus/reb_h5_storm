By the looks of that amulet, I see that you havedelivered Bhato Bloodspear to the eternal rest of the deep lake.<br1>
I'msure Shilen has taken his bloody soul.<br1>
My comrade, you have fought wellfor the brothers of the woods.<br1>
There is nothing more you need to do now.<br1>
I have received word that the orc army has retreated back to the MistyMountains.<br1>
I'm sure their severe defeat this time will be a lesson tothem, and they will not attempt to take over our woods again.<br1>
There arestill orcs lurking in the woods, but they are mere stragglers that havestrayed from their army.<br1>
To commemorate your achievement in this battle,I will present you with this.<br1>
This is a weapon used by our *Red SunsetBrothers* who fought alongside Smallberry during the battle with theElves.<br1>
That clan has been disbanded now, but the swords and staffs theyused are presented even now to talented youth that fight for the gloryof our race.<br1>
My young brother, until the day we meet again, may thebrilliance of mithril shine on the woods, lakes, and in your soul.<br1>
