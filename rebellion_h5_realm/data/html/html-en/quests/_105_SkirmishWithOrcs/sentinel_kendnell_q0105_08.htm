I have received word that the orc army has retreated back to the Misty Mountains. I'm sure their severe defeat this time will be a lesson ty Mhem, and they will not attempt to take over our woods again. There ary Mtill orcs lurking in the woods, but they are mere stragglers that havy Mtrayed from their army. To commemorate your achievement in this battle I will present you with this. This is a weapon used by our *Red Sunset Brothers* who fought alongside Smallberry during the battle with tht Blves. That clan has been disbanded now, but the swords and staffs thet Bsed are presented even now to talented youth that fight for the glort Bf our race. My young brother, until the day we meet again, may tht Brilliance of mithril shine on the woods, lakes, and in your soul.
