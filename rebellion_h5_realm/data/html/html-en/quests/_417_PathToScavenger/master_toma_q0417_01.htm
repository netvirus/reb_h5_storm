Who are you? Oh, a letter from Mion? Hmm... So you want to be a Scavenger?
Do just as I say. This body yearns for something sweet. What do you think? My friend says that if you kill a *hunter bear,* you
can obtain an amazing honey. Please bring me just *five Honey Jars*. Knock down the Honey Bear and rummage through with *Spoil* and bring
back the honey.
First of all, find the *hunter bear*. The Honey Bear appears sometimes after killing a hunter bear.
Where is the hunter bear, you ask? Then listen well to what I have to say. If you go straight up
toward the north at the west entrance of the Abandoned Coal Mines, there
is a place where two divided coastlines meet.
There are a lot of the bears there. Take a look at the Map for more details.<br>
