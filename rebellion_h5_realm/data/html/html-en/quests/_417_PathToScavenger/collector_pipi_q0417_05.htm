Well, I will tell you ...<br1>
I don't know anything about the test.<br1>
But really, I don't think that the test is important. The one really important thing, if you ask me, is *tithing*.<br1>
Do you know how much money the guild spends on managing just one member?<br1>
From guild uniforms to insurance and information fees, to giving good information to guild members ... a lot of money is needed.<br1>
To obtain those funds, the most important thing is tithing, giving ten percent of what you earn ... Ah ... How to become a Scavenger?<br1>
Only *Master Toma* can confirm it.<br1>
His sister *Trader Mion* knows where he is, so ask her.<br1>
I'll write you a letter of introduction.<br>
