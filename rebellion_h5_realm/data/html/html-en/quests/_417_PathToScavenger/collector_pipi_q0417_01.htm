You wish to become a Scavenger?<br1>
How commendable of you! There should be more bright youngsters like yourself, but they are all to rare ...<br1>
What good is an Artisan anyway? All you do is work your back off under someone else all your life.<br1>
When would you even touch a stuffed money pouch? Tsk, tsk ...<br1>
Compared to that, if you become a Scavenger you can enjoy a successful life in your later years, just like  me, if you're willing to put up with just a little trouble in your youth.<br1>
You have made an excellent choice. Well then, shall I tell you how to become a Scavenger?<br>
