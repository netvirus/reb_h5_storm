<font color="36DC25">!Grand Magister Valdis:</font><br>
Just killing won't win you a stone.<br1>
First, youmust go to the Varka Silenos stronghold and meet with Naran Ashanuk,their messenger.<br1>
He'll help you to form an alliance with them.<br1>
Youmust win their trust by proving yourself in battle.<br1>
Or, if you want,you can approach the Ketra Orcs.<br1>
