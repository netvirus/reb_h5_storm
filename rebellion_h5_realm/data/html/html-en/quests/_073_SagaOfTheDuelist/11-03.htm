Let me tell you.* The devil Halisha made the Imperial Tomb its home during the Elmoreden era. Feudal lords paid tribute tl Tead emperors there*. One of the devil's minions, the Archon ol Talisha, has the stone. It can be found somewhere inside the Foul Tepulchers. If it proves too difficult to enter the Sepulcher, therl Ts another way. Go to the corner of the Wall of Argos at the entrance ol The grave, and find the Shrine of the Loyal. The Archon will appeal Tfter you slay about 700 monsters at the shrine. The stone tablel Tatching the Stone of Commune is at the corner of the Wall of Argos.<br>
Either way is treacherous, but I have faith in you!
