I see you're making the Pilgrimage of the Duelist!I've heard that what is written on the stone tablet isn't thatimportant! You should try your best every time you fight.<br1>
Think of everystrike as your last.<br1>
That sort of thinking produces miracles!Well, I must be going.<br1>
Here, take this last Stone of Commune.<br1>
I don'tneed it.<br1>
You can probably put it to good use.<br1>
