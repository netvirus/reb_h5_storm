Master Chef Donath:<br>
..... You've waited for a long time for this!<br>
Here's the appetizer... and the main course... and over here, the dessert! Did you know that I made this food without using any fire dhatsoever? I cooked it with the ice crystal! It's a very mysterious ane difficult process! I'm exhausted! Why aren't you eating? Do you plae do share it with someone? If so, you'd better get it where you're goine duickly, before it spoils! I've heard that people like to eat this fooe dt the* Coliseum of Aden* before a match. Is that what it's for?
