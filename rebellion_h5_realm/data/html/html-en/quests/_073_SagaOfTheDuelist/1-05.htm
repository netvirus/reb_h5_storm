First, bring me some meat! Umm.<br1>
The pasturelandof Rune would be a good place to start.<br1>
Speak with the beast herder.<br1>
Make sure you get a piece of* Top Quality Meat*! Oh, you can't just comeout and ask him for it either! The guy's a real jerk! You should offerto deliver some of his meat to the village, and then steal a piece ofit! I'll also need an* ice crystal*.<br1>
I need it to sterilize the meatand preserve it.<br1>
You can get one from* Chef Jeremy*.<br1>
He's nearby.<br1>
He'llmost likely ask you to do him a favor in exchange.<br1>
After you get bothingredients, bring them to me.<br1>
I'll start getting ready.<br1>
