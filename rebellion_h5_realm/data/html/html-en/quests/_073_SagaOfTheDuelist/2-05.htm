Okay.<br1>
First you must go to Goddard and get the* gourmetmeal* that was eaten by the Duelists before competitions and bring it tome.<br1>
There's a great chef there who can make it for you.<br1>
I think his namewas Donath or something.<br1>
Bring it to me, I'll tell you everything Iknow about Duelists.<br1>
