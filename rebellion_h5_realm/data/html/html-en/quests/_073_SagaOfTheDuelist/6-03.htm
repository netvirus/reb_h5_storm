Countless thoughts beyond comprehension searpainfully into your brain.<br1>
You hear the faint whisper of a woman'svoice.<br1>
A series of visions appear.<br1>

Now he stands before the monument to prevent any other Duelistfrom challenging his power.<br1>
You'll find him at the southeast corner ofthe Ketra Orc Outpost.<br1>
