Master Chef Donath:<br>
Did you bring the high quality meat I requested?<br>
Don't ask him for it directly! That son of a gun won't give it to you!<br>
Offer to deliver some to the village for him, and then steal a piece of it! Ask Chef Jeremy for the ice crystal. Bring both of those things tf ie when you get them.
