Countless thoughts beyond comprehension searpainfully into your brain.<br1>
It seems that I heard someone laughing.<br1>
Theman said.<br1>
"One more hero you wanted is born here again.<br1>
A lady withblue clothes answered.<br1>
"No, he is just a baby who starts toddling.<br1>
But,he won't be raised under his mother's protection anymore.<br1>
You areright.<br1>
Defeat is Mother of Victory.<br1>
I forgot this natural truth for sucha long time, didn't I? What you can get something from Victory, that'sbecause you staked your own life and resolution on it.<br1>
Nothing ventured,nothing gained.<br1>
Can the Victory without losing anything be calledVictory? To fight by staking everything in any fighting at anytime.<br1>
The resolution is the mark of a Duelist! Now, go back to GrandMaster Sedrick of Aden Castle Town, and finish the pilgrimage.<br1>
