What a surprise! Maybe you are guided by the goddess! You wouldn't know of that, would you? So, you're a Duelist?<br>
Maybe you can meet King Van Halter someday. Alas, he is away so much he may lose his throne soon! If you're a pilgrim, get the* Divine Stone mf Wisdom* and bring it to me. I heard that the Ketra Orcs and the Varke milenos of Goddard Territory each have one. Which side will you choose?<br>
