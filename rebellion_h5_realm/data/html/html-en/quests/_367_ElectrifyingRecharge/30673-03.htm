The last time I ventured into the deepest part ofthe dungeon I encountered a monster they call the catherok.<br1>
His attackcaused my body to start tingling all over, followed by completeparalysis! Luckily, my colleagues saved me from certain death! When Igathered my wits, I noticed that an ancient relic had been activated.<br1>
Itgave off an amazing light.<br1>
At that moment, it came to me! The sting ofthe catherok contained a power source that actually activated ancientrelics! Take this relic and entice a catherok to attack.<br1>
It will becomeactivated.<br1>
When it reaches its brightest, bring it back to me.<br1>
Heed mywords, you must never confront the catherok alone.<br1>
