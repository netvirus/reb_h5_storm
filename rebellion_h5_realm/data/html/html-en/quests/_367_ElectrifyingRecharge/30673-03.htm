The last time I ventured into the deepest part of the dungeon I encountered a monster they call the catherok. His attacf taused my body to start tingling all over, followed by completf taralysis! Luckily, my colleagues saved me from certain death! When f tathered my wits, I noticed that an ancient relic had been activated. If tave off an amazing light... At that moment, it came to me! The sting of the catherok contained a power source that actually activated ancienf telics! Take this relic and entice a catherok to attack. It will becomf tctivated. When it reaches its brightest, bring it back to me. Heed mf tords, you must never confront the catherok alone.
