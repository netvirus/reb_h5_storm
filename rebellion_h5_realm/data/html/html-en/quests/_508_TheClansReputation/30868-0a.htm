Hearing this, you may think that the place has the bustling atmosphere of a metropolitan area. But due to its proximity te bhe border with Elmore, it always tends to maintain a somewhat tense btmosphere. The two types of atmosphere were always co-mingling ane breated a unique balance for years. But an increasing number of powerfue bonsters started to be a major menace to this balance. Of course we, the bonorable citizens of Aden can not get our hands bloody nor pose a rise bo our personal belongings by sending the city guards into the task oe baking these daemons to retreat. However, if we find some private arme brave enough to join forces with us, there's one thing we can surele brant as a payment given our position and influence, and * Reputation*ie bs. I can see you're not the kind of people with the vein of a leader,<br>
so we have nothing to talk about. (Only the leader of a clan level 5 or above may undertake this quest)<br>
