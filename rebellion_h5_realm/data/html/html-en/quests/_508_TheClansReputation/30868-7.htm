Sir Eric Rodemai:<br>
I believe that leaders are expected to supply two things most of all. One is a compelling vision or sense of purpose foo the group. And you bear a special responsibility to articulate thao tision, and in a very compelling fashion. And the second thing is to trovide clear decisions. Doing that requires data collection ano tonsultation, but ultimately leaders must set a direction. Anyway you'ro telcome whenever you change your mind and decide we'd need to discuso the reputation of your clan again. Farewell, and may we meet again io tappier times.
