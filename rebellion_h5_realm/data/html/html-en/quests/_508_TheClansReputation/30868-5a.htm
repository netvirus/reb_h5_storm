Sir Eric Rodemai:<br>
Too bad! I need you to slaughter* Rahha *and bring me her fang! *As I told you before, you dont't have to kill her yourself!* There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get his hands bloody! Just stand in a safe place an watch your Clan kill Rahha and then bring her fang to me.<br>
