Hearing this, you may think that the place has the bustling atmosphere of a metropolitan area. But due to its proximity te bhe border with Elmore, it always tends to maintain a somewhat tense btmosphere. The two types of atmosphere were always co-mingling ane breated a unique balance for years. But an increasing number of powerfue bonsters started to be a major menace to this balance. Of course we, the bonorable citizens of Aden can not get our hands bloody nor pose a rise bo our personal belongings by sending the city guards into the task oe baking these daemons to retreat. However, if we find some private arme brave enough to join forces with us, there's one thing we can surele brant as a payment given our position and influence, and * Reputation* it is. I've been told you lead a personal army, but i'm afraid your fellows may lack the strenght required for we to engage in a business. (This quest may only be undertaken by clans of level 5 and above)<br>
