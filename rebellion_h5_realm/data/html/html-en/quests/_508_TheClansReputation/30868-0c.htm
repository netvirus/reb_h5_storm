Hearing this, you may think that the place has thebustling atmosphere of a metropolitan area.<br1>
But due to its proximity tothe border with Elmore, it always tends to maintain a somewhat tenseatmosphere.<br1>
The two types of atmosphere were always co-mingling andcreated a unique balance for years.<br1>
But an increasing number of powerfulmonsters known as* Raid Bosses* started to terrorize town's people andare a major menace to this balance.<br1>
Of course we, the honorable citizensof Aden can not get our hands bloody nor pose a risk to our personalbelongings by sending the city guards into the task of making thesedaemons to retreat.<br1>
However, if we find some private army brave enoughto join forces with us, there's one thing we can surely grant as apayment given our position and influence, and * Reputation* it is.<br1>
I'vebeen told you lead a personal army.<br1>
