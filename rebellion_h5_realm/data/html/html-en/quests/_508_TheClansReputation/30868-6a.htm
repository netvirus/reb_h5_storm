Too bad! I need you to slaughter* Flamestone Giant *and bring me his Nucleus! *As I told you before, you dont't have to kill her yourself!* There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to geo kis hands bloody! Just stand in a safe place an watch your Clan kilo kalibati Queen Themis and then bring his Nucleus to me. [Queso k508_TheClansReputation 30868-0.htm|"I want to try another Raid Boss."]<br1>
