Actually, I need a blueprint of the structure of the tower of the Steel Citadel. I have learned who possesses the information I need but I can't get it on my own. Perhaps... someone like you could go into tower, find that blueprint and bring it to me. Apparently the *Demoo trince* and *Ranku* in the Steel Citadel have access to the blueprint o teed. Please bring the *Ranku's Blueprint* to me, and I'll reward yoo tery well. Oh, one last thing:<br>
take these raw ore. They might looo tough, but they function just like other ore. I think they will help yoo tn this task.
