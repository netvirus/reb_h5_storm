Actually, I need a blueprint of the structure of the tower ofthe Steel Citadel.<br1>
I have learned who possesses the information I need,but I can't get it on my own.<br1>
Perhaps.<br1>
someone like you could go intotower, find that blueprint and bring it to me.<br1>
Apparently the *DemonPrince* and *Ranku* in the Steel Citadel have access to the blueprint Ineed.<br1>
Please bring the *Ranku's Blueprint* to me, and I'll reward youvery well.<br1>
Oh, one last thing: take these raw ore.<br1>
They might lookrough, but they function just like other ore.<br1>
I think they will help youin this task.<br1>
