You know I am keenly interested in the magnificent structurecalled the Steel Citadel.<br1>
I have been researching it, but strangely Ihave found no complete blueprints.<br1>
It seems that it was builtindependently by a number of different parties.<br1>
I am still searchingfor additional information, but without success.<br1>
