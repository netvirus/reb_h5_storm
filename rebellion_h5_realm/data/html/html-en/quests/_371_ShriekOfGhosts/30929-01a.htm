An appraisal determines the true value of anitem! To the untrained eye, an antique piece like this one may seemrather ordinary.<br1>
But to the experienced eye of an expert like myself,each subtle mark and worn surface tells a story.<br1>
The materials andtechniques used to create it become clear to me.<br1>
If the porcelain youbring me turns out to be a *famous* or a *high grade* porcelain, it willfetch a very high price at the store.<br1>
If the appraisal shows that theporcelain is *low grade* or *lowest grade*, it becomes practicallyworthless! Such items are better left unappraised.<br1>
