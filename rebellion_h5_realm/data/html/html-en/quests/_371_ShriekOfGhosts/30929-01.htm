It has come to my attention that the Orc seerReva of Aden Castle Town is collecting Ancient Ash Urns.<br1>
I asked him togive them to me so that I could sell them for a handsome price toantique collectors.<br1>
He refused my offer, insisting that he needed themfor a ritual! He promised me that if he finds an urn that does notcontain any remains he would send it to me.<br1>
