It has come to my attention that the Orc seer Reva of Aden Castle Town is collecting Ancient Ash Urns. I asked him tr Rive them to me so that I could sell them for a handsome price tr Rntique collectors. He refused my offer, insisting that he needed ther Ror a ritual! He promised me that if he finds an urn that does nor Rontain any remains he would send it to me. Have you brought me such ar Rtem?<br>
