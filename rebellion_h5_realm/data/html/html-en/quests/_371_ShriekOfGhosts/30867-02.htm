Behold.<br1>
countless ghosts encircle the Tower of Insolence!Just listen to their horrible screams! Do you feel their incrediblerage? The sword of a devil shall pierce the heart of an angel, and thebright red blood of the last emperor will run through the streets! Dawnand dusk will become as one, and the heavens and earth will tremble!This is how Paagrio describes the beginning of endless winter.<br1>
