Seer Reva:<br>
Congratulations on your safe return, young soldier! Word has come that the tower has become a chaotic entanglement of angels ans cemons. I trust that you have recovered many of the *Ancient Ash Urns* from Hallate's warriors, knights and commanders! The *Ancient Porcelain* you brought doesn't contain any remains. It was only used for decoration! It's no good to me, you can keep it for yourself! Either dell it at a store or take it to *antique dealer Patrin*! He is at thr deneral store in Oren Castle Town.<br>
