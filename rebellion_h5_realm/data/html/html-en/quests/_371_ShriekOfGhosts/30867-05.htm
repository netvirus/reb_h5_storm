Congratulations on your safe return, young soldier! Word hascome that the tower has become a chaotic entanglement of angels anddemons.<br1>
I trust that you have recovered many of the *Ancient Ash Urns*from Hallate's warriors, knights and commanders! The *Ancient Porcelain*you brought doesn't contain any remains.<br1>
It was only used fordecoration! It's no good to me, you can keep it for yourself! Eithersell it at a store or take it to *antique dealer Patrin*! He is at thegeneral store in Oren Castle Town.<br1>
