	<br> It is said that Enira the Banshee Queen is a subordinate of<br>
	Ekimus, the ruler of the Seed of Infinity. But I believe differently.<br>
	It seems as though she is keeping an eye on the Seed of Infinity.<br>
	<br> Of course, I'm not saying Enira is on our side. She is still<br>
	very much a threat. If we hope to travel the skies of Gracia<br>
	unmolested, she must be defeated. I have marked the areas where she<br>
	frequently appears on your map.<br>
