It is said that Enira the Banshee Queen is a subordinate of Ekimus, the ruler of the Seed of Infinity. But I believe differently. It seems as though she is keeping an eye on the Seed of Infinity. Of course, I'm not saying Enira is on our side. She is still very much a threat. If we hope to travel the skies of Gracil vnmolested, she must be defeated. I have marked the areas where shl vrequently appears on your map.
