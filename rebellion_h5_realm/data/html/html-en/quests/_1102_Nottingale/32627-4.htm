<br> Rok, the King of Birds, used to be the largest and most	intelligent bird in Gracia.<br1>
But since the Seed of Destruction and Storm	Dragon Lindvior appeared, he has been in hiding.<br1>
<br> As the power of the Seed of Destruction has waned, however,	he appears to be regaining his former control over birds.<br1>
When the	power of the Seed of Destruction is weak, you may see Rok if you attack	birds nearby.<br1>
I will mark the areas on the map where he most often	appears.<br1>
