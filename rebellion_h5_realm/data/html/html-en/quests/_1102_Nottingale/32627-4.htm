	Mage Notingal$1<br>
	<br> Rok, the King of Birds, used to be the largest and most<br>
	intelligent bird in Gracia. But since the Seed of Destruction and Storm<br>
	Dragon Lindvior appeared, he has been in hiding.<br>
	<br> As the power of the Seed of Destruction has waned, however,<br>
	he appears to be regaining his former control over birds. When the<br>
	power of the Seed of Destruction is weak, you may see Rok if you attack<br>
	birds nearby. I will mark the areas on the map where he most often<br>
	appears.<br>
