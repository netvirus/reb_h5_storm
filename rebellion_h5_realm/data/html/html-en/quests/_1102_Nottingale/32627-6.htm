	Mage Notingal$1<br>
	<br> Dius the Messenger of Destruction is a huge Drake of the Sky.<br>
	He scours the skies for Tiat, the lord of the Seed of Destruction.<br>
	<br> Fortunately, he is normally scarce. If you apply a special<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">bait for Drakes</font> to<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Baby Drake Wings</font>, however, you can lure him<br>
	out. I will mark the area where he appears on your map.<br>
