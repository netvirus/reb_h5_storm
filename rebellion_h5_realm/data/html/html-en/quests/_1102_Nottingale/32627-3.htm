	<br> Valdstone the Master Rider used to be a lord of this land. He<br>
	gained the power to control wild Aurabirds in exchange for yielding his<br>
	territory to the Seed of Infinity.<br>
	<br> His Elite Riders always watch our fortress. Look at the map<br>
	to see where he and his minions most frequently appear.<br>
