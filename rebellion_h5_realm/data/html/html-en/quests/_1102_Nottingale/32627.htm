	<br> First of all, you must acquire either an Aurabird or an<br>
	Airship in order to fight against the enemies who populate our skies.<br>
	Since the number of Airships is limited, I recommend you acquire an<br>
	Aurabird.<br>
	<br> To do so, go meet Engineer Lekon and do what he tells you.<br>
	Even if you decide to acquire an Airship, Lekon is worth talking to.<br>
	<br> Check your map and I will tell you his location.<br>
