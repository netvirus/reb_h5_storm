<br> First of all, you must acquire either an Aurabird or an	Airship in order to fight against the enemies who populate our skies.<br1>
Since the number of Airships is limited, I recommend you acquire an	Aurabird.<br1>
<br> To do so, go meet Engineer Lekon and do what he tells you.<br1>
Even if you decide to acquire an Airship, Lekon is worth talking to.<br1>
<br> Check your map and I will tell you his location.<br1>
