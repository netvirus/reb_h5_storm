Regardless of his character, *Duke Iason Heine* has apoint.<br1>
The *Tasaba lizardmen* are definitely a menace to Innadril.<br1>
Itwould be one thing if all they did was attack travelers, but now it issaid they have something far more sinister planned.<br1>
Take this order.<br1>
Iwish you luck.<br1>
