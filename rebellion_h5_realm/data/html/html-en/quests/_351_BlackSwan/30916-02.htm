Duke Iason Heine refused the Lord's offer, saying thatit was a private matter and he would deal with it.<br1>
This would be a goodtime to compliment the Duke on his concern for the public treasury, but,alas, I know him too well.<br1>
Anyway, I'm recruiting volunteers to driveaway the Tasaba lizardmen for the Duke.<br1>
He will personaly give out therewards when we are successful.<br1>
