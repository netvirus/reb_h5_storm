I am the first and the last Orc, the sole receiver ofPaagrio's energy, the patriarch of all Orcs! Though my physical form isgone and my soul hangs on by a thread, I linger to look after my proudOrc descendants! In the beginning, Paagrio created me from the essenceof fire.<br1>
My body was forged in the eternal flame, and my power woulddestroy mountains! My powers rivaled the gods'! When Paagrio ordered meto earth, I was set upon and killed by the jealous gods.<br1>
