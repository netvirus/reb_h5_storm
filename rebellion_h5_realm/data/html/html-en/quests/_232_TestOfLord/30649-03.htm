The First Orc, born of Paagrio's flame, was a verypowerful being.<br1>
The gods of wind, earth and water were jealous of hispower and sought to kill him.<br1>
Eventually they were successful, but notbefore the mighty Orc created, with his last dying breath, theoriginators of the 7 tribes.<br1>
I was among them, the originator of theHestui tribe .<br1>
We originators of the 7 tribes followed the teachingsof the first Orc and worked hard to make our tribes prosperous.<br1>
After108 Orc tribes had taken root in this land we knew that our purpose wasaccomplished.<br1>
We came to this cave, destroyed our exhausted bodies andleft only our souls to watch over our descendants and test young Shamanswho want to be the Lord of the Orcs.<br1>
