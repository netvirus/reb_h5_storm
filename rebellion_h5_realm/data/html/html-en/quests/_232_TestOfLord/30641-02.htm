Don't you know anything about the Duda-Maratribe's totem? Our totem is the giant spider! Spinning a web and stayingcompletely still with icy patience until the enemy falls into the trap.<br1>
And once they do, we finish them off with stealth as only a predatorcan! This is the way our tribe fights! If you want to understand themeaning of our totem, gather the materials to make the totem! You'llneed feelers and legs of spiders, but not just any spider! They must bestrong and fierce spiders! I heard there are marsh spiders in the CrumaMarshlands.<br1>
