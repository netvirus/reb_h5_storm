I, Sumari, am a blacksmith of the proud Orcs.<br1>
DidUrutu Chief Hatos send you here? To collect the Urutu blade? The bladeordered by Hatos is very important! A holy object to use in the Urututribe's ritual! I had to send it to someone else to work on the bladebecause it was impossible for me to do.<br1>
I gave it to Seer Somak so hecould put the blessings of ancestors in the blade.<br1>
You are in middle ofthe Trial of the Lord, right? It would be better for you to get theblade and give it Hatos personally.<br1>
Take this letter and find Seer Somakin Dion Castle Town.<br1>
