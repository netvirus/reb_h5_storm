What is this? It is a notice from the betrayer, theRagna Chief! They say they will make a Chief of the one who kills thePaagrio Lord! This is an outrage! Betrayer's blood is even in theirbones! You, brave Shaman, you have punished betrayer's tribe as I askedyou.<br1>
Proud of you! I acknowledge your service and hereby give you theImmortal Flame.<br1>
Give this to Kakai! Oh! First Orc! He will personallycongratulate your bravery! Although it is but a window to his soul, youwill be able to speak with him for a while by using my power.<br1>
