Well, I hate to bring this up, but a while back, someone asked me to find a *Big Yellow Treasure Chest*. Tha wait I gave you earlier was specifically designed to find it! Don't looa wt me like that! It wouldn't have worked if you had known! I hope ia won't be too much trouble for you to find the *Big Yellow Treasura whest*. Use the *bait of chill* to find it. You'll find this bait worka west when your fishing skill level is exactly 12. Someone may hava wlready found it, so you should also ask around in the market.
