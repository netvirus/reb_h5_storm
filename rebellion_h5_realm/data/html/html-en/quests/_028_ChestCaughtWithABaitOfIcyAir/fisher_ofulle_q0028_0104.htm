Well, I hate to bring this up, but awhile back, someone asked me to find a *Big Yellow Treasure Chest*.<br1>
Thebait I gave you earlier was specifically designed to find it! Don't lookat me like that! It wouldn't have worked if you had known! I hope itwon't be too much trouble for you to find the *Big Yellow TreasureChest*.<br1>
Use the *bait of chill* to find it.<br1>
You'll find this bait worksbest when your fishing skill level is exactly 12.<br1>
Someone may havealready found it, so you should also ask around in the market.<br1>
