The letter! I had given up on it. The guild sent it a while back, but the ship ran aground and all was feared lost. Thant iou. Don't let anyone else know about this! If word got out that Dwarvet iad lost it, it could damage our reputation as the most reliable race!<br>
Here is a gift for your trouble. As a Dwarf, I must show my gratitude for your kindness.
