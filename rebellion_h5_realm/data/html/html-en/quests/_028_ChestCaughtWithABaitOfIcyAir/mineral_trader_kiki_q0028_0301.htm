The letter! I had given up on it.<br1>
The guild sentit a while back, but the ship ran aground and all was feared lost.<br1>
Thankyou.<br1>
Don't let anyone else know about this! If word got out that Dwarveshad lost it, it could damage our reputation as the most reliable race!Here is a gift for your trouble.<br1>
As a Dwarf, I must show my gratitudefor your kindness.<br1>
