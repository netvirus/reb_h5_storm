How are the preparations progressing? I see that youare curious about why we are preparing for this ceremony rather thansimply leaving for the hunt.<br1>
But you have hunted outside before, so youmust know that you may meet a foe stronger than you are or be overcomeby a poison you have never before encountered.<br1>
Through this ceremony, wehelp ensure the safety of those the participants.<br1>
The preparationsshould be complete by now.<br1>
Go back to *Perwan in the Cave of Souls*.<br1>
