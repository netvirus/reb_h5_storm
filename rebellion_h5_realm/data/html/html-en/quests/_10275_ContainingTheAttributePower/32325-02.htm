	Attribute Master Yi$1<br>
	<br> My disciples and I were conducting an experiment. We hoped to<br>
	derive a greater attribute power. But the sprites we were studying<br>
	became...problematic. Some of the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Sprites of Water</font> became increasingly<br>
	reckless when injected with the attribute power, and they escaped from<br>
	the lab.<br>
	<br> My disciples have tried to recapture them. But some of the<br>
	sprites are still roaming throughout the town. Thankfully, there<br>
	haven't been any reports of them causing serious harm yet. But you<br>
	never know when they might turn fierce...<br>
	<br> Will you catch them for us?<br>
