<font color="FF8000"><html><body>	Attribute Master Yin:</font><br>
<br> My disciples and I were conducting an experiment.<br1>
We hoped to	derive a greater attribute power.<br1>
But the sprites we were studying	became.<br1>
problematic.<br1>
Some of the	<font color="LEVEL">Sprites of Water</font> became increasingly	reckless when injected with the attribute power, and they escaped from	the lab.<br1>
<br> My disciples have tried to recapture them.<br1>
But some of the	sprites are still roaming throughout the town.<br1>
Thankfully, there	haven't been any reports of them causing serious harm yet.<br1>
But you	never know when they might turn fierce.<br1>
<br> Will you catch them for us?	<br>	<a		action="bypass -h Quest _10275_ContainingTheAttributePower 32325-03.<br1>
