	<br> Do you know<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Attribute Master Yang</font> here in Rune Township?<br>
	He is one of our regulars. His research keeps him very busy. Of course,<br>
	his constant need for ingredients also makes him one of our best<br>
	customers.<br>
	<br>But I rarely see him lately. Our sales have dropped, and his<br>
	absence isn't helping.<br>
	<br>The last time I saw him, he mentioned some problem she was<br>
	facing, a problem he said could be resolved by a capable adventurer...<br>
	I hope that happens quickly -- we need his business! But alas, I don't<br>
	know how to find respectable adventurer in these parts...<br>
	<br> Do you know of one who might be willing to help us?<br>
