<br> Do you know	<font color="LEVEL">Attribute Master Yang</font> here in Rune Township?	He is one of our regulars.<br1>
His research keeps him very busy.<br1>
Of course,	his constant need for ingredients also makes him one of our best	customers.<br1>
<br>But I rarely see him lately.<br1>
Our sales have dropped, and his	absence isn't helping.<br1>
<br>The last time I saw him, he mentioned some problem she was	facing, a problem he said could be resolved by a capable adventurer.<br1>
I hope that happens quickly -- we need his business! But alas, I don't	know how to find respectable adventurer in these parts.<br1>
