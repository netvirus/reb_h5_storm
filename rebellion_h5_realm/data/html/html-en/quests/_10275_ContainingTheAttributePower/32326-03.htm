Attribute Master Yang:
I appreciate your help. Unfortunately, it won't be easy. You must recapture the
<font color="LEVEL">Reckless Sprites of Wind</font> using this device. They are still precious experimental subjects, remember. If they are killed, all our work will have been in vain. This device changes the materialized energy into a form we can still use. That should allow me to continue my research. One more thing: the device's power is limited, and it will disappear after
<font color="LEVEL">10 minutes</font>. Please act quickly!
