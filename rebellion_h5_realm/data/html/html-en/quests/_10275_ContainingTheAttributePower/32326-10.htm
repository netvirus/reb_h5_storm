	Attribute Master Yan$1<br>
	<br> You succeeded! Thank you.<br>
	<br> I'd like to give you something as a reward, but all that I<br>
	have here are my research notes about attributes. Hmm...I can give you<br>
	an Attribute Ore. It has value, so you won't regret acccepting it.<br>
	<br> Since you have completed my request twice, I'll give you 2<br>
	Ores reflecting the attribute of your choosing. Now, which ones do you<br>
	want?<br>
