<br> Do you know	<font color="LEVEL">Attribute Master Yin</font> here in the Town of	Aden? She is one of our regulars.<br1>
Her research keeps her very busy.<br1>
Of	course, her constant need for ingredients also makes her one of our	best customers.<br1>
<br> But I rarely see her lately.<br1>
Our sales have dropped, and	her absence isn't helping.<br1>
<br> The last time I saw her, she mentioned some problem she was	facing, a problem she said could be resolved by a capable adventurer.<br1>
I hope that happens quickly -- we need her business! But alas, I don't	know how to find respectable adventurer in these parts.<br1>
