	<br> Do you know<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Attribute Master Yin</font> here in the Town of<br>
	Aden? She is one of our regulars. Her research keeps her very busy. Of<br>
	course, her constant need for ingredients also makes her one of our<br>
	best customers.<br>
	<br> But I rarely see her lately... Our sales have dropped, and<br>
	her absence isn't helping.<br>
	<br> The last time I saw her, she mentioned some problem she was<br>
	facing, a problem she said could be resolved by a capable adventurer...<br>
	I hope that happens quickly -- we need her business! But alas, I don't<br>
	know how to find respectable adventurer in these parts...<br>
	<br> Do you know of one who might be willing to help us?<br>
