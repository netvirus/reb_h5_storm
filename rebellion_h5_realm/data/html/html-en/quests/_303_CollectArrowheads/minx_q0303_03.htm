<font color="36DC25">Master Minia:</font><br>
When I was young, I had the opportunity to visit manyplaces around the continent and experience different cultures.<br1>
Perhapsit is because I am a master who studies swordsmanship, but I wasnaturally drawn to the weapons of diverse races.<br1>
That led to my hobby ofcollecting various rare weapons.<br1>
These days, I am interested in theweapons of the Tunath orcs, who are natives of Talking Island.<br1>
The orcs'weapons differ slightly according to region, but the orcs of this islandwere isolated for a long time from the mainland and that is probably whythe shape of their weapons is very unique.<br1>
For that reason, I would liketo add the *arrowhead* of the Tunath orcs to my collection.<br1>
If you havethe time, could you collect Orcish Arrowheads for me? Of course, I willpay you for your services.<br1>
