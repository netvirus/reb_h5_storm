There are many Orcs on Talking Island, but the TunathOrcs are at the *Elven Ruins*.<br1>
There you will be able to find arrowheadsused by the Tunath Orc Marksmen.<br1>
If you don't know how to find theruins, ask Guard Kenyos.<br1>
These would not be soley for my own privatecollection.<br1>
I plan to donate some to Sedrick's Training Hall forexhibition, so please bring back ten arrowheads.<br1>
