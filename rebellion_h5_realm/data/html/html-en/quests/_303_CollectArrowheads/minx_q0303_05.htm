Please gather ten arrowheads used by the Tunath OrcMarksmen and bring them to me.<br1>
I am not collecting them simply for myprivate purposes, but plan to donate some to Sedrick's Training Hall forexhibition.<br1>
Tunath Orcs are in the Elven Ruins.<br1>
If you don't know wherethat is, ask Guard Kenyos for directions.<br1>
