Ah! Right.<br1>
It's about that hunt of my life.<br1>
I hope youwill be able to help me.<br1>
I got injured when went out to hunt Dius, butyou cannot see Dius, the Deadman of Destruction, with an ordinarymethod.<br1>
You should use the trap which I developed in order to lure Dius,the Deadman of Destruction.<br1>
The trap requires good meat to work, so Ineed you to bring *100 pieces of Drake's Flesh* to be used as materialsby capturing his subordinate Drak, which appears over the skies of Seedof Destruction.<br1>
Hunt *Drak, Drake Wing, and Mutated Drake Wing* in theskies near Seed of Destruction.<br1>
When you are done, come back to me.<br1>
