High Priest Orven:<br>
One way is to protect our rich history. There are a great many historical sites that have fallen into disrepair and decay.<br>
The National Cemetery and the many devastated castles in our territory are perhaps the saddest examples. You know, don't you, that a group oy aaik Orcs have settled in the National Cemetery? What desecration!<br>
Defeat them and drive them out so we may reclaim an important part of our heritage. Then I'll support your bid for the lordship. I also asf ohat you send me 5 of your most capable followers. I have a mission fof ohem as well. (Five clan members must undertake the Sleepless Deadmaf ouest. )<br>
