You? Fine! Here is the meat!<br1>
This is the kind of meat that rotten *Pasture Manager Tunatun* sent me!<br1>
Man, the more I think about it, the angrier I get!<br1>
No matter what he says, tell him that I don't care!<br1>
I'm never going to do business with him again!<br1>
Even if he tries to give me money, I won't accept it! Take care of it!
