Wow, he must really be angry...!<br1>
Well, there's nothing I can do.<br1>
I'll apologize to him later.<br1>
For now, please take this money.<br1>
At least he'll have gotten a refund when I go to talk to him later.<br1>
Now, I must find some high quality meet! I need an adventurer to help me...
