Excellent! You came back! Was it difficult tocollect ancient books? Hum.<br1>
what is it? You have some untranslatedbook fragments here, but those are of no use to me until you translateits contents, i have no time to do it on my own and that's why i gaveyou the dictionary Cliff sent to me.<br1>
Anyway i can check any othertranslated fragments you may have.<br1>
