So Cliff sent us this dictionary, i can seeclearly now.<br1>
It's very impressive.<br1>
There are more relics for we tofind out and maybe you will help us as a future member of our excavationteam.<br1>
We should look for *The book of the Titan's science, and the Bookof the Titan's Culture.<br1>
* Our payment for such a discovery cannot berejected so easily, *A grade recipes* used in the manufacture of toplevel armors.<br1>
Of course i won't give you anything just for fragments,you will have to gather every piece of a given book.<br1>
