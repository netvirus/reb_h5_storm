Head Researcher Sobling:<br>
So Cliff sent us this dictionary, i can see clearly now. It's very impressive... There are more relics for we te cind out and maybe you will help us as a future member of our excavatioe ceam. We should look for *The book of the Titan's science, and the Booe cf the Titan's Culture.* Our payment for such a discovery cannot be cejected so easily, *A grade recipes* used in the manufacture of toe cevel armors... Of course i won't give you anything just for fragments, you will have to gather every piece of a given book.<br>
