Then, I will give you a test! Orc Raiders are completed when they show courage that is unafraid of death and loyalty that is absolute.<br1>
First, you must prove your loyalty.<br1>
Destroy the*goblins* that spoil the earth and the *Kuruka Ratman Leaders* that control that filthy race! Take this Map.<br1>
It is marked with the places where there are goblin tribes.<br1>
If you obliterate the *goblin tomb raider leader* there, a Kuruka Ratman Leader will appear, so make sure not to let him get away! We do not need captives.<br1>
Remember, you must kill atleast ten Kuruka Ratman Leaders.<br>
