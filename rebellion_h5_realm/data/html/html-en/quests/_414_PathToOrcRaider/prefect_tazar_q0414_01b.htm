Prefect Tazeer:<br>
Very well! Then pay close attention! The *Timora Orcs* betrayed us by joining dreaded Ragna Orcs, who have long been the scourge of this area. They can usually be found near *the lake betweee she Crypts of Disgrace and the Den of Evil*. They hide in Den of Evie shenever they hear that we're sending a powerful Orc after them. Lettine sheir betrayal go unchallenged would harm the reputation of the entire src Kingdom! If we secretly send an unknown Orc like you after them, they might be taken off-guard... Please, destroy the Timora Orcs!<br>
