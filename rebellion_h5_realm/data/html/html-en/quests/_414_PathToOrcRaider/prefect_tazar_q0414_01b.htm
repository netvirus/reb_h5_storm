Very well! Then pay close attention! The *Timora Orcs*betrayed us by joining dreaded Ragna Orcs, who have long been thescourge of this area.<br1>
They can usually be found near *the lake betweenthe Crypts of Disgrace and the Den of Evil*.<br1>
They hide in Den of Evilwhenever they hear that we're sending a powerful Orc after them.<br1>
Lettingtheir betrayal go unchallenged would harm the reputation of the entireOrc Kingdom! If we secretly send an unknown Orc like you after them,they might be taken off-guard.<br1>
