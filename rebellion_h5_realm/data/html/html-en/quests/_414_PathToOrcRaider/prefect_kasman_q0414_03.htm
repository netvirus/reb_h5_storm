Foul betrayers, to think that they abandoned the courage and loyalty of our race, they have become low Orcs depraved in body as well as in soul.<br1>
How truly wicked they look.<br1>
I am moved to think that we have shown mercy by killing them! Anyway, you have done well.<br1>
You have truly demonstrated both courage and loyalty.<br1>
Congratulations! I bestow this token on you.<br1>
Take it and go to *High Prefect Osborn* right here! He will change your profession to Orc Marauder.
