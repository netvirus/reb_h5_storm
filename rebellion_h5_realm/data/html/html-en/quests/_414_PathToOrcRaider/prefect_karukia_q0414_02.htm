<font color="36DC25">Prefect Karukia:</font><br>
Of course, I know your goal is to be a dignified andnoble member of our race.<br1>
But courage unsupported by ability isfoolishness! That is a path that leads only to a meaningless death.<br1>
Train patiently, youngster, and your chance will come.<br1>
