[Fate's Whisper]:<br>
I hear a soft voice whisper in my ear;<br>
"...the wind never sleeps, The waves of change are turning. The paths of darkness and light intersect, A new song of dawn begins..."<br>
"Listen to the call of fate. You, who will shape the face of the continent!<br>
Go see Maestro Reorin... Master Smith of the Platinum race awaits you in the land of Oren..."<br>
"...and, in the bottomless pit of despair, let new hope flower, and arm yourself anew with the well-trained flames of eternal torment..."<br>
