Congratulations! You have finally reached level 7. Now you can learn new magic as well as strengthen your existing magic. To do so, please visit the<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Magister in the village.</font> If you follow the arrow above your head, you will be able to find the Magister. However, to learn new magic, you must first purchase a<br>
<font color="LEVEL">spellbook</font>. Spellbooks can be purchased from the<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Magic Supply Store.</font> The Magister will tell you which spellbook you should purchase. In order to learn a skill, a certain number of<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Skill Points (SP)</font> is required. Your SP will increase gradually every time you kill a monster, so if you run out ol iP while learning skills, you can always earn more by hunting monsters. To check your current SP amount, open the<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Character Info Window</font> by clicking on the<br>
<font color="FF0000">face-shaped icon</font> on the bottom right screen or pressing ALT+T. <img src="L2UI_CH3.tutorial_img08" width=175 height=110><br>
