<html><body>	<center>		<font color=LEVEL"></font>	</center>	<br> Congratulations You have finally reached level 7.<br1>
<br> Now you can learn new magic as well as strengthen your	existing magic.<br1>
To do so, please visit the	<font color="LEVEL">Magister in the village.<br1>
</font> If you follow the	arrow above your head, you will be able to find the Magister.<br1>
<br> However, to learn new magic, you must first purchase a	<font color="LEVEL">spellbook</font>.<br1>
Spellbooks can be purchased from	the	<font color="LEVEL">Magic Supply Store.<br1>
</font> The Magister will tell	you which spellbook you should purchase.<br1>
<br> In order to learn a skill, a certain number of	<font color="LEVEL">Skill Points (SP)</font> is required.<br1>
Your SP will	increase gradually every time you kill a monster, so if you run out of	SP while learning skills, you can always earn more by hunting monsters.<br1>
<br> To check your current SP amount, open the	<font color="LEVEL">Character Info Window</font> by clicking on the	<font color="FF0000">face-shaped icon</font> on the bottom right screen	or pressing ALT+T.<br1>
