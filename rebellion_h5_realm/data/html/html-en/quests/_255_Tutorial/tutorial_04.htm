<html><body>	<center>		<font color=LEVEL">Using the Mouse Wheel</font>	</center>	<br> Good work.<br1>
Now you will learn about enlarging and shrinking	the screen using the mouse wheel.<br1>
<br> If you rotate the	<font color="LEVEL">mouse wheel</font> down, you enlarge the game	screen.<br1>
Rotate the wheel up to reduce the screen.<br1>
<br> The more you turn the wheel, the larger or smaller the screen	becomes, but notice that there is a limit to how far you can go in	either direction.<br1>
