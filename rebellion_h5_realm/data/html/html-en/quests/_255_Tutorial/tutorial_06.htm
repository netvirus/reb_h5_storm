Now we will learn about clicking the mouse wheel.<br1>
<br> Try clicking the	<font color="LEVEL">mouse wheel</font>.<br1>
By clicking the wheel, your	viewpoint changes to a frontal view.<br1>
If you're already looking straight	forward, clicking the wheel will switch directions so you're looking	straight back.<br1>
<br>The rearward view will help you in situations such as running	away from a monster, or to determine how far you have traveled.<br1>
Also,	it will help you maintain a uniform distance from other characters.<br1>
