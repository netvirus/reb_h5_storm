<br> Next time rest when your HP or MP are low.<br1>
<br> But remember, when you sit down to rest you must find a place	where monsters will not attack you.<br1>
When sitting down, it takes time to	stand up after you are attacked, slowing down your counterattack and	allowing you to take more damage.<br1>
