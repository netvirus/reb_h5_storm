	Magister Mirie$1<br>
	<br> I heard about you from Captain Lucas. You're the one who<br>
	helped the Sages of Magic study the mutated Kaneus in Kamaloka, aren't<br>
	you?<br>
	<br> I can now you now that our study is not limited simply to<br>
	those mutants. Actually, Kamaloka itself is an omen of impending crisis<br>
	and chaos. Others magisters may think differently, but that's the view<br>
	of my fellow Sages and myself.<br>
	<br> We hope that by studying the Kaneus, we can determine what<br>
	specifically triggered the mutations.<br>
	<br> Brave adventurer, you must return to Kamaloka and bring us<br>
	more<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">tissue samples from the mutated Kanues</font>. Your<br>
	act could greatly accelerate your research.<br>
