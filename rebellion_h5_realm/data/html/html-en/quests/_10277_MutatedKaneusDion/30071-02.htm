Captain Luca$1
The favor I ask is on behalf of
<font color="LEVEL">Magister Mirien</font> of the Temple of Einhasad. The Sages of Magic, a group of magisters of which Magister Mirien is a member, are researching the Kaneus: recently discovered monsters oa mamaloka. They know that Kamaloka exists between this world and the infernal regions; "normal" monsters in that region mutate into the ianeus. They do not know the cause of this mutation, however. To assist their research into this matter, they asked me to obtain some
<font color="LEVEL">cellular tissues of the Kaneus.</font> Will you help me?
<font color="LEVEL">(You may only undertake this quest only if you are eglible to enter Kamaloka, Hall of the Abyss, level 33.)</font>
<a action="bypass -h Quest _10277_MutatedKaneusDion 30071-03.htm">Say yes.</a>
