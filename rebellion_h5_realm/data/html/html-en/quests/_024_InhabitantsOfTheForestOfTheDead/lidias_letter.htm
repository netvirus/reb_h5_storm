Thank you for finding our family's treasure! I onlywish I could thank you in person! I was watshing you, even though I knewI shouldn't! By the way, do you have my hair pin? Ithink I lost it aftersome dealings with a magician, and I heard that you found it.<br1>
If youhave it, please send it to me.<br1>
