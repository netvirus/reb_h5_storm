Good! You must first take this badge.<br1>
It is amark that lets others know that you are in the midst of taking the Trialof the Guildsman.<br1>
Many Blacksmiths and Warehouse Chiefs will help youwhen they see your badge.<br1>
The content of the test is quite simple.<br1>
Itconsists of *making seven Journeyman Rings*.<br1>
It may sound simple but theprocess of making the ring itself will challenge your ability and wit.<br1>
Why seven rings? Actually.<br1>
You shall offer one to the yet-to-come Kingof the Dwarves, and the rest to the six Elders of the guilds.<br1>
It is along held tradition that has been kept since the founding of the kingdomand the forming of the guilds.<br1>
If you wish to learn to make the rings,go and see *Blacksmith Altran of Talking Island*.<br1>
Take him this letter.<br1>
Don't worry, I expect nothing in return.<br1>
When you complete the sevenrings come and see me again.<br1>
