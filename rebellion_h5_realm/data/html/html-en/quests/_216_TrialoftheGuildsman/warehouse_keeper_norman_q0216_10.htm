Yes, that's the way to behave, good boy.<br1>
Now Ishall tell you the list of materials that you need to find.<br1>
First of allwe need some *Gray Bone Powder* to use as the abrasive.<br1>
You can get itfrom undead monsters such as *ghouls* or *strains*.<br1>
I heard that thereare plenty in the Execution Ground of Dion.<br1>
And I also need a *GraniteWhetstone* which is for processing the surface of the jewel.<br1>
It wouldbe best if you can find a piece of *granite golem*! Other necessarythings would be.<br1>
The *Red Pigment*! Which you can get from the *deadseeker* bat in the Execution Ground.<br1>
Last, we need some *Braided Yarn*.<br1>
That you can get by hunting the *silenos* in Giran.<br1>
Can you remembereverything? I need *70 of all the above things each*.<br1>
You said that youneeded 7 Journeyman Gems, right? It takes 10 materials each per 1 jewel.<br1>
