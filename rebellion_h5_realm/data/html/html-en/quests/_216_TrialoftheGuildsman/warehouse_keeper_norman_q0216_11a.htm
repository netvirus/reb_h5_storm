First of all we need some *Gray Bone Powder*to use as the abrasive.<br1>
You can get it from undead monsters such as*ghouls* or *strains*.<br1>
I heard that there are plenty in the executionplace of Dion.<br1>
And I also need a *Granite Whetstone* which is forprocessing the surface of the jewel.<br1>
It would be best if you can finda piece of *granite golem*! Other necessary things would be.<br1>
The *RedPigment*! Which you can get from the *dead seeker* bat in the ExecutionGround.<br1>
Last, we need some *Braided Yarn*.<br1>
That you can get by huntingthe *silenos* in Giran.<br1>
Did you memorize everything? Don't forget itthis time.<br1>
