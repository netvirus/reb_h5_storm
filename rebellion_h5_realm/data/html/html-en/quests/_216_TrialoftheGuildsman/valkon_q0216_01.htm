I have been in charge of the promotion test ofthe Dwarf union members, for the last 10 years.<br1>
Among all Dwarfapprentices, only those who pass this test are accepted as true membersof the Dwarf society.<br1>
Perhaps you might not understand this well, sinceyou are not a Dwarf, but even within our Dwarf society, there is acomplex hierarchy and ranking system.<br1>
