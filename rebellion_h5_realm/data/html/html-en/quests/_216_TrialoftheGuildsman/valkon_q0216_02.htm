How long will you be an apprentice? Don't youhave any ambition? I hope you are not under the impression that you havereached a comfortable level.<br1>
Shouldn't you work harder and challenge the*Trial of the Guildsman*? You won't be a true member of Dwarven societyuntil you pass that test.<br1>
If you are really satisfied being a nobody forthe rest of your life, I won't mention it again.<br1>
