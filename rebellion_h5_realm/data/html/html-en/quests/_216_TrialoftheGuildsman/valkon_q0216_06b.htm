Hmm.<br1>
What nerves you've got.<br1>
Hints.<br1>
Well,yes I just came across one.<br1>
I heard that Altran used to be a kind man,but perhaps because of his aging, he seems to be a bit fastidious thesedays.<br1>
Some say that it is because of the arthritis.<br1>
Whatever thereason may be, he grumbles a great deal these days.<br1>
Perhaps he may bepleased to receive a mandragora berry which they say it is helpful toarthritis.<br1>
