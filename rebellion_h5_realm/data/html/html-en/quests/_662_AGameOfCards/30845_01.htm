Are you here because you heard the rumor, too?These days, I spend a lot of my time playing cards with the travelerswho pass this way.<br1>
Naturally, there's plenty of reward for those whoplay a good game.<br1>
Feel up to a game?<br>Of course, since you stand to win a fair amount, you can't play forfree.<br1>
That's why it's a game of chance, eh? If you want to play with me,bring me some of those red gems that have recently caught my eye.<br1>
