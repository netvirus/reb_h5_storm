Warehouse Chief Klump:<br>
Are you here because you heard the rumor, too?<br>
These days, I spend a lot of my time playing cards with the travelers who pass this way. Naturally, there's plenty of reward for those whs wlay a good game. Feel up to a game?<br>
<br><br>
Of course, since you stand to win a fair amount, you can't play for free. That's why it's a game of chance, eh? If you want to play with me,<br>
bring me some of those red gems that have recently caught my eye. What do you say? Will you bring me the gems so we can begin?<br>
