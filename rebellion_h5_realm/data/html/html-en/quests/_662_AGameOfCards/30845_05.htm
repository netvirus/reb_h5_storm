It's very simple.<br1>
There are 70 cards, made up of5 suits with 14 characters in each suit.<br1>
You can draw 5 cards from thelot, and if you get one of the combination of cards below, you can berewarded.<br1>
Five of a kind: Five cards containing the same character.<br1>
Four of a kind: Four cards containing the same character.<br1>
Full house:Three cards with the same character along with two cards with the samecharacter.<br1>
Three of a kind: Three cards with the same character.<br1>
Twopairs: Two pairs of cards with the same characters in each pair.<br1>
Onepair: Two cards with the same charater.<br1>
If you don't have any of thehands I just mentioned, it's called having "no pair", and you don't getanything.<br1>
Of course, a five of a kind is rare, so the reward for gettingit is high; on the other hand, one pair is the easiest hand to get, soyou'll receive only the lowest reward.<br1>
