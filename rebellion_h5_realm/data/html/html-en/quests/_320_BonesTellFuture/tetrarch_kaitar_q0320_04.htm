If you follow the road to the southwest section of thevillage, you will come to the abandoned *School of Dark Arts*.<br1>
It wasbuilt a long time ago, for the greatest sorcerers of our race to studyblack magic.<br1>
There, we developed a way to undo the curse on our racewhich made sunlight scorch our skin, and we also began studying spellsto unseal our patriarch.<br1>
However, when we were at war with the Elves ofLight, we abandoned the school for strategic reasons.<br1>
We destroyed allthe research materials so our magical results would not fall into thehands of our enemy.<br1>
However, the few brothers who could not escape andwere surrounded by the enemies put an end to their own lives and rose asthe undead to fight the enemy until the end.<br1>
The brothers who weresacrificed then still wander along the corridors of the Institute as*skeleton* spirits.<br1>
I would like you to bring me their *bone pieces*.<br1>
The bones of those who died in a war that was rampant with slaughter anddeath have especially strong black magic powers.<br1>
I do not need many.<br1>
Just find me *ten*.<br1>
