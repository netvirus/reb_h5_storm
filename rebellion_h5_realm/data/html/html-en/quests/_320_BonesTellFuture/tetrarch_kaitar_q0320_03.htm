<font color="36DC25">!Tetrarch Kaitar:</font><br>
I am a member of the Tetrarch council, but at the sametime I am an Abyssal Celebrant.<br1>
For the past 300 years, I have lived tofulfill the will of Gran Kain and Shilen.<br1>
The goddess Shilen controlsdeath and fate and sometimes lets us steal a glance at the futurethrough death.<br1>
The goddess taught me how to read the future by throwingbones of the dead and examining the shape they make when they fall onthe ground.<br1>
Once a month, I perform spells to foresee the dangers ordisasters that will affect my race, and forecast the direction in whichthe Temple of Darkness must proceed.<br1>
In days like these, when enemiesthat threaten our race are all around, it is my bounden duty to seewhether there are any disasters or dangers in the future for my race.<br1>
Every time I make my predictions, I need new *bone pieces*.<br1>
The olderthe bones are, the stronger the power of death that lies within them, soI can see the future more clearly.<br1>
I would ask you to collect the bonepieces needed for my spell.<br1>
