This book hasn't aged a day.<br1>
It waslong ago and just after lunch.<br1>
We were playing outside when<font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Tobias</font>who is now in Gludio Town used this book to squash a bee.<br1>
We were bothso terrified that the bee wasn't dead that we left it there.<br1>
I meant topick it up in a day or so, but somehow we both forgot.<br1>
But now it ishere, as if some cosmic fate is trying to tell us something.<br1>
Listen.<br1>
