Huh? I've seen this book?! .<br1>
Where did you findthis? I thought I lost it.<br1>
Thank you so much.<br1>
I remember spendingcountless hours with my nose in this book, studying religion anddaydreaming when I was young.<br1>
Now.<br1>
.<br1>
I'm too busy for such things.<br1>
Anyway, this book is sentimental.<br1>
I appreciate you bringing it to me.<br1>
