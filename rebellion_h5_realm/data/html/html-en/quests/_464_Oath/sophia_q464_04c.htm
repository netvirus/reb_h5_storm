This book is actually quite familiarto me.<br1>
Hmm.<br1>
smell those pages! Decades ago I gave this book to<font color="LEVEL">Flauen</font>who is now the Gatekeeper in Heine.<br1>
She and I were close friends growingup.<br1>
But our paths separated and I've lost touch with her.<br1>
I wonder whatshe's up to these days? .<br1>
Let me say this; I don't believe incoincidences.<br1>
Perhaps you could do something for me.<br1>
would you takethis book to<font color="LEVEL">Flauen the Gatekeeper in Heine</font>? And tell my old friend that I said hello? If you do, I can take careof any late fees at the library for you.<br1>
