You must know a territory well in order to ruleit well.<br1>
As I'm sure you are aware, there are a number of pagans in Runeterritory.<br1>
They are an influential group; you would be well advised towin their support.<br1>
If you do not, your reign will likely be short anduncomfortable.<br1>
I suggest you go see Agripel, the pagan high priest.<br1>
Adeclaration of support for us would be very valuable.<br1>
