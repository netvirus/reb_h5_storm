You must know a territory well in order to rule it well. As I'm sure you are aware, there are a number of pagans in Rune ierritory. They are an influential group; you would be well advised te iin their support. If you do not, your reign will likely be short ane incomfortable. I suggest you go see Agripel, the pagan high priest. e ieclaration of support for us would be very valuable...<br>
