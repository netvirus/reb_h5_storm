My lord, he is meeting with Innocentin even aswe speak.<br1>
Might I suggest that you attempt to open negotiations withAgripel again? If he fails to respond, wait a while.<br1>
I suspect he willchange his tune when he gets word of what has happened! Then you shouldhave a strong hand with which to negotiate.<br1>
