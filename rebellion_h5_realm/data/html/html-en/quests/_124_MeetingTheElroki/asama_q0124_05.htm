Yes, or so the shaman Karakawei and I believe.<br1>
My father is theonly Elrokian to have explored the Lost Nest, bringing back the ancientrelic.<br1>
He has truly devoted his entire life to restoring the loststature of the Elroki tribe.<br1>
Despite his efforts, some malcontentsaccused him of dwelling on the past while neglecting the present.<br1>
Nowtheir influence has spread like a grass fire in summer.<br1>
