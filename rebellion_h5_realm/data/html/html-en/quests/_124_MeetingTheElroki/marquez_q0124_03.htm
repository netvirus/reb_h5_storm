The conflict between Humans and Elrokhians began when theexplorers built this wharf and maintained a presence here.<br1>
Our tworaces are divided by differences in culture and language.<br1>
What seemsnormal to one is often strange, even offensive, to the other.<br1>
Despite myefforts to teach both sides to live together in harmony,misunderstandings are common.<br1>
Blood has been spilled on more than oneoccasion, and the peace that now exist is fragile at best.<br1>
The Humanssee the Elroki tribe as nothing more than violent savages, while theElrokhians see Humans as invaders.<br1>
