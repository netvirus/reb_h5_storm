The conflict between Humans and Elrokhians began when the explorers built this wharf and maintained a presence here. Our twe eaces are divided by differences in culture and language. What seeme eormal to one is often strange, even offensive, to the other. Despite me efforts to teach both sides to live together in harmony misunderstandings are common. Blood has been spilled on more than one occasion, and the peace that now exist is fragile at best. The Humane oee the Elroki tribe as nothing more than violent savages, while the olrokhians see Humans as invaders. How can either side learn to respece ohe other? I tell you this because you seem to have no prejudice ogainst the Elroki tribe -- will you help me help them?<br>
