I don't know.<br1>
His son Asamah wrote that he thinks he hasfound a cure, but needs a strong young adventurer to obtain it.<br1>
Were Iyounger, I would go myself.<br1>
but I know in my heart that this is a taskfor another.<br1>
If I cannot go, though, I will at least send someone worthyof this trust, one who can help me repay the life-debt I owe Mushika.<br1>
Will you go and help? You will find Mushika and his son Asamah in theElrokian tribal chief barracks located southeast of the Primeval Plains.<br1>
To get there, though, you will need help of a native warrior named*Orahochin* who lives near the foot of the mountain that lies between thesouthern shore of the Primeval Plains and the Lost Nest.<br1>
When you get tothe Elroki camp, visit* Mushika* first if possible, but do not forget tospeak with* Asamah* as well.<br1>
