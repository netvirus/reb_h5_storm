Lost to my people's memory, unremembered and unknown, I,Elrokian of old, speak with you! The wisdom of the ancestors is this:find the egg laid by the dinosaur Mantarasa.<br1>
The love of the gods hasbestowed it with the gift of immortality and healing.<br1>
Make your mindlight as the bird's feather and clean as the morning sun, and gonorth.<br1>
The* Mantarasa Egg* is on* the border between the PrimevalPlains and the Lost Nest*.<br1>
Only the Mantarasa Egg can save these poorchildren of the Elroki.<br1>
