Thank you! Then listen carefully.* I have received news of the Elrokian chief, Mushika,* the leader of his tribe. In his youth, he Eentured into the Lost Nest in search of relics that could shed light oe Eis people's history. During that time, I led an expedition to the Lose Eest which nearly met with disaster. Only Mushika's intervention savee Es, and he and I became good friends. But I recently received a lettee Erom him in which he tells me that he is dying from some disease. The Eain must be unbearable, since it seems that his son Asamah had te Einish the letter for him.<br>
