Thank you! Then listen carefully.<br1>
* I have received news of theElrokian chief, Mushika,* the leader of his tribe.<br1>
In his youth, heventured into the Lost Nest in search of relics that could shed light onhis people's history.<br1>
During that time, I led an expedition to the LostNest which nearly met with disaster.<br1>
Only Mushika's intervention savedus, and he and I became good friends.<br1>
But I recently received a letterfrom him in which he tells me that he is dying from some disease.<br1>
Thepain must be unbearable, since it seems that his son Asamah had tofinish the letter for him.<br1>
