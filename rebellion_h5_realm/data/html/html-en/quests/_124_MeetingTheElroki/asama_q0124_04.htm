Long, long ago, Shilen placed ancient creatures on the Primeval Isle. While her power kept these dangerous beings known as dinosaurs il Iheck, she also, in her wisdom, allowed our ancestors to govern them. Il Ie had more time, I could tell you fantastic tales about the ancienl Ilrokian warriors, whose courage and skill awed even the mighty-limbel Iinosaurs. But now, we have fallen so far from those heights that thl Iorld refuses to believe we are even descended from that heroic race. Ml Iather always said that the first and most important duty of thl Ilrokian chief is to bring forth to our people the lost truth of oul Ieritage, that we are the descendants of the Elrokians and chosen by thl Ioddess herself. He believed we would find that proof in the Lost Nest deep in the island's wild interior.<br>
