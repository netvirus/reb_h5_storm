Long, long ago, Shilen placed ancient creatures on the PrimevalIsle.<br1>
While her power kept these dangerous beings known as dinosaurs incheck, she also, in her wisdom, allowed our ancestors to govern them.<br1>
Ifwe had more time, I could tell you fantastic tales about the ancientElrokian warriors, whose courage and skill awed even the mighty-limbeddinosaurs.<br1>
But now, we have fallen so far from those heights that theworld refuses to believe we are even descended from that heroic race.<br1>
Myfather always said that the first and most important duty of theElrokian chief is to bring forth to our people the lost truth of ourheritage, that we are the descendants of the Elrokians and chosen by thegoddess herself.<br1>
He believed we would find that proof in the Lost Nest,deep in the island's wild interior.<br1>
