Unfortunately, all I could discover was when the medicineexisted.<br1>
So I asked the shaman Karakawei to summon the spirits of theElrokians of that time and ask them where the medicine is.<br1>
Karakaweiknew the risks, but for my sake he attempted to summon our ancestors'spirits.<br1>
For many days, his efforts were in vain, but finally he wasable to contact a spirit who possessed knowledge of the medicine'swhereabouts.<br1>
Since then we've been anxiously waiting for an adventurerwith the courage and skill to recover it for us.<br1>
There is not a momentto spare! Please go straight to Karakawei -- you'll probably find himpraying around the barracks.<br1>
After you've obtained the medicine, pleasereturn to me at once.<br1>
In the meantime, I will attempt to discover thecause of this illness while protecting my father from the riots.<br1>
