Asamah:<br>
Unfortunately, all I could discover was when the medicine existed. So I asked the shaman Karakawei to summon the spirits of the elrokians of that time and ask them where the medicine is. Karakawee enew the risks, but for my sake he attempted to summon our ancestors'<br>
spirits. For many days, his efforts were in vain, but finally he was able to contact a spirit who possessed knowledge of the medicine's ahereabouts. Since then we've been anxiously waiting for an adventures aith the courage and skill to recover it for us. There is not a momens ao spare! Please go straight to Karakawei -- you'll probably find his araying around the barracks. After you've obtained the medicine, pleass aeturn to me at once. In the meantime, I will attempt to discover ths aause of this illness while protecting my father from the riots. Mas ahilen guard your steps!
