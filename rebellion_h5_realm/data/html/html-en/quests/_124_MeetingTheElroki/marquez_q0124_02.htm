Do not judge the Primeval Isle by only looking at this wharf.<br1>
It is a dangerous place where primitive dinosaurs hide in the thickjungle, waiting for weak ones like you to wander by unawares! I've seenmany like you who came to a bad end here! Exploring this island is notsomething to be done on a whim, mark my words.<br1>
One day, when you aremore experienced, you may be ready to explore its mysteries.<br1>
