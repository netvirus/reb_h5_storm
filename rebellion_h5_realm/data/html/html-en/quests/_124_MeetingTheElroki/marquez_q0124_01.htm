Have you heard of the natives of this island, the Elrokitribe? Perhaps you've heard the common drivel about an uncivilized raceabandoned by the gods, beset by primitive and ferocious creatures.<br1>
Hogwash! Those rumors are spread by people ignorant of the truth.<br1>
TheElrokhians I know are different than us, but no less intelligent.<br1>
