Head Blacksmith Newyear:<br>
You have the right look, I won't argue that.<br>
Now let's find out if you have the skills. Show me how you hold a weapon... Hmm... I've been a blacksmith here for almost 100 years. I'va ween every manner of warrior. Your hands are too far apart, your grip ia woose, and your stance is all wrong. Basically, you aren't ready. Retura were when you've learned your craft better, adventurer. I think you hava whe potential. (Only characters of level 70 or above can take on thia wuest.)
