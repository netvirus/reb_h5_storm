You're full of confidence, I see.<br1>
Well, that'sright and proper; you have the skill to back it up.<br1>
Just the sort ofadventurer I need! In the heart of the Ruins of Pavel there is a Dwarvenbarracks.<br1>
There you will find my associate, *Collector Yumi*.<br1>
She willgive you a job if you tell her I sent you.<br1>
She's, um, a littleeccentric.<br1>
I'm not sure what she'll make of you, but I think you'll passmuster with her.<br1>
