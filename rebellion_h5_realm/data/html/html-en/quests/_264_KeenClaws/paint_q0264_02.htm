The arrows sold in this store are specially crafted by myhands.<br1>
As you know, the shaft is made from ash and the tips are madefrom steel or adamantium.<br1>
But sometimes I get orders for custom-madearrows.<br1>
Just a few days ago, *Assassin Kiel Knighthawk* placed an orderfor claw-shaped arrows made from *wolf claws.<br1>
* Hooked arrows made fromclaws are difficult to pull out once they are lodged in the body, andcreate great internal wounds.<br1>
*Kiel* said that he had to leave for acastle siege soon and to complete the arrows within a week.<br1>
However,time is too short and I must ask your assistance.<br1>
