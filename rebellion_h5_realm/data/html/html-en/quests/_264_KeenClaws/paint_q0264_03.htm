Thank you.<br1>
Your task is fairly simple.<br1>
Collect *fiftywolf claws* and bring them to me.<br1>
You can acquire the claws by huntingthe *ashen wolves* or *goblins* outside of the village.<br1>
The lowestgoblins have crude talismans made by stringing wolf claws.<br1>
As a rewardfor helping me, I will give you one of the defense items from my store.<br1>
I swear on the eye of *Shilen* which observes everything, that I willfaithfully fulfill the terms of our contract.<br1>
Wonderful! I thank you inadvance.<br1>
There is not much time, so please hurry.<br1>
