Thank you.<br1>
I see you have brought me fifty wolf claws.<br1>
Now I can start on the special arrows that *Kiel* has ordered.<br1>
I hope Ican finish them in time, before he leaves for *Pabel*.<br1>
According to ourcontract, I will give you this.<br1>
It may not be flashy, but it is lightand very strong, and will surely be useful one day.<br1>
Now, shall we go ourseparate ways? May the shelter of the abyss envelope you until we meetagain.<br1>
