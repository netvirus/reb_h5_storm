The arrows sold in this store are specially crafted by myhands.<br1>
As you know, the shaft is made from ash and the tips are madefrom steel or adamantium.<br1>
But sometimes I get orders for custom-madearrows.<br1>
For example, the *Assassin Kiel Nighthawk* has ordered aclaw-shaped arrowhead made of wolf claws.<br1>
He is away at the siege battlein *Giran* right now, but I am sure he will order arrowheads again whenhe returns.<br1>
I'd like you to help me gather the wolf claws when that timecomes.<br1>
