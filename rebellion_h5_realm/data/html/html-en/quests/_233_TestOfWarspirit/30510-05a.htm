Braki of the Duda-Mara tribe, fought against the 3000 armytroops of Elmore with only 200 soldiers, some 500 years ago.<br1>
He didn'tyield the camp site of Horsehoof Valley and resisted for 100 days! Brakitook advantage of the steep landscape and overcame the inferiority innumbers! Moreover, there were only 3 Sorcerers in the camp but he madethe most out of them and managed to weaken the leader and causedisruption among the enemies.<br1>
But the very day the back-up troopsarrived, Braki died of hunger, thirst, and fever! It is said that hegrieved bitterly about the fact that he couldn't die in thebattlefields! He was an Orc who was not only clever in the head, butalso burning with combativeness in his heart! According to my research,Braki's remains are in the hands of a Human evil magician called Orimthe Shadow.<br1>
