I bet that the grave of the Orc warrior that you arelooking for was already excavated and destroyed.<br1>
But they say that oncein a while, the ancient relics are found in the ant tunnel so if you arelucky enough you might find the bones that you are looking for.<br1>
If myguesses aren't wrong, it must be the soldier ants who carry such thingsas bones and remains.<br1>
I think they'll have cut it into 5 pieces more orless.<br1>
