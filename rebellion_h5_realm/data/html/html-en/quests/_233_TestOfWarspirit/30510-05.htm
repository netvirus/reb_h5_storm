To pass the test, you must first find the bones of theancestors who passed away while fighting in a war! Then through a trialthou can win over the power of the spirits to your side! This place, thekingdom of Aden, is a place where numerous Orc warriors fought and bled!However, now it is a territory where Humans reign, and our glorioushistory is gradually being forgotten! Isn't it reasonable for us tocelebrate the victory we achieved in this land, and collect the remainsand place them on the Immortal Plateau! I, seer Somak investigated thebiography of our tribe, which was handed down from mouth to mouth, andfound out about 4 warriors.<br1>
