You are indeed one of the Orcs.<br1>
So straightforward.<br1>
That is right.<br1>
The remains of Braki who you Oaks worship asyour hero, is in my hands.<br1>
I bet that you will take it from me anyway,even though I resist to give it to you.<br1>
I am well aware of the Oak'sgreat power.<br1>
To tell the truth, I don't want to fight you.<br1>
This is notshowing off, so don't take me wrong, but if we fight, I'm telling you,it is not likely that you will survive, either.<br1>
Therefore, let's preventfrom getting involved in a fight which is damaging for both of us.<br1>
Asyou know, the remains of Braki is powerful fetish filled with strongmagic.<br1>
If you can find me a thing that has equal magical power, I shallgladly give you your hero's remains.<br1>
