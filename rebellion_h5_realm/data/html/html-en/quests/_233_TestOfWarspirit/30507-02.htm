After the death of beleth, Kiruna remained in the Human'sworld and became the Commanding General of the kingdom's west army.<br1>
Somehuman poets said that Kiruna fell in love with Kelhas, the EinhasadPaladin, but that's absolute nonsense! Why would an Orc Amazon fall inlove with a weak Human! Kiruna died after suffering from a mysteriousfever.<br1>
The Humans buried her with the other Human Warriors in thecemetery.<br1>
It is obvious that a great hero like her should have a grandfuneral in the Cave of Ordeal! However Kiruna herself asked to be buriedwith the other Human soldiers.<br1>
I don't know where that place is exactly.<br1>
But I found out that there are records left about Kiruna in the Einhasadtemple of this village.<br1>
Go to the temple and find out about Kiruna'sremains! I also heard that a female Human called Vyvyan knows somethingabout it.<br1>
I shall give you this totem.<br1>
It is a precious thing whichcontains our ancestor's spirits.<br1>
I think it will help you in finding theheroine's remains.<br1>
Now it is time for you to leave.<br1>
Meet PriestessVyvyan of the village temple.<br1>
