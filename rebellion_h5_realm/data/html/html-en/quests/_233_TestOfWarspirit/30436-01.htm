A letter from Priestess Vyvyan? The grave of PaladinKelhas and Commander Kiruna? Well.<br1>
Surely there were many graves ofthe Elmoreden era here.<br1>
But sandwind was vicious, and what's evenmore, the giant ants excavated the place.<br1>
I bet that all the gravesand the relics in it have disappeared by now.<br1>
Although chances arescarce.<br1>
I would try the ants tunnel if I were you.<br1>
According to theadventurers who investigate the Wastelands, they say that the ancientrelics are found in the ant tunnel now and then.<br1>
Perhaps the remainsthat you are looking for might have been excavated by the ants as well.<br1>
If my guesses aren't wrong, it must be the soldier ants who carry suchthings as bones and remains.<br1>
They normally cut things into pieces, suchas a human corpse.<br1>
Well.<br1>
Perhaps 5 pieces? I'll give you thisillustrated book for reference.<br1>
It will help you when you are exploringthe ant tunnel.<br1>
