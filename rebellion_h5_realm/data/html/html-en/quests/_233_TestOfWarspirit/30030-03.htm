Kiruna and Gelhaas were 2 Warriors who fought bravelyagainst the army of the devil, Beleth.<br1>
Their army won every battle, butthen one day, Gelhaas was killed by the evil spirits of Beleth.<br1>
ImagineKiruna's sorrow when she heard the news that her lover was killed.<br1>
A fewdays after the incident took place, it is said that she went to thebattlefield with her lips tightly sealed and won a great victory overthe army of Beleth.<br1>
But unfortunately, in the final battle Kiruna waswounded deeply.<br1>
She was removed to the shrine for remedy, but in the endshe died and was buried beside Gelhaas.<br1>
Some say that she refused to betreated herself.<br1>
Sometimes, the feelings which you call as a sign ofweak-mindedness, can be the source of powerfulness.<br1>
