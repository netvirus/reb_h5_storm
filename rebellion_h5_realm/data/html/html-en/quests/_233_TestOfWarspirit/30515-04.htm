That was magnificent, young shaman! You have swept themedusas clear out and won back the remains of great hero! But I am sosorry that our forefather's remains are in such wretched condition! Ihave no face to see our ancestor's spirit! We are to blame forabandoning our forefather's spirit! I, Seer Manakia shall readjust*Hermodt's Remains*, to a well-preserved shape! Thou, young man of Orc,even when you pass the Test and become a higher level shaman, neverforget! The spirits of our great heroes! The glory of our forefatherswho fought for the tribe!<br1>
