<font color="FF8000">Seer Racoy:</font><br>
What a pity! Our great ancestor's body has been ripped intopieces by some mere ants! I cannot bring anymore shame to the remains ofthe dead! Give me the bones of Kiruna.<br1>
I , Seer Racoy, shall shroud thedead body into a decent shape according to our funeral traditions.<br1>
now, young shaman, take these bones with solemnity.<br1>
Have courtesywhile carrying it.<br1>
Always remember, no matter what road you shall takein the future.<br1>
