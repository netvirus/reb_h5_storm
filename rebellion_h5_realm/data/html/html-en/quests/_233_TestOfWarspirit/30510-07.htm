Tejakar Oroka! You have found the remains of all 4 heroes!I shall place these bones in the blessed pot.<br1>
Meanwhile, you prepare forthe next stage of the trial.<br1>
To win over the power hidden in the remainsof heroes, you must go through the War Spirit's Trial.<br1>
To carry out thisholy and solemn trial, you must see the forefather spirit Martankus inthe Cave of Ordeal.<br1>
But before seeing him, you should prepare anappropriate present for him.<br1>
I think he will be most pleased to receivethe heads of the betrayers, so go to the south of Aden and kill theTamlin Orcs there.<br1>
