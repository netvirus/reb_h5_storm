The lizardman shamans understood the power hidden inTornar's body.<br1>
So they ran off with the remains.<br1>
Then afterwards, withthe bones, they made several fetishes.<br1>
Those fetishes are still handeddown among the Leto lizardmen until this day! The Leto lizardmen formeda strong force in the southern part of Oren.<br1>
