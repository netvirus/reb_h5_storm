<font color="36DC25">!Orim of the Shadow:</font><br>
First, I need the eye of a creature called a porta.<br1>
They call it the eye but in fact it is a small and solid thing like ajewel.<br1>
And scales of an excuro.<br1>
Those scales of the excuro are as hardas steel but once you kill it, it is easy to peel them off.<br1>
And finally,I need a mordeo talon.<br1>
It is a silver-white, hook shaped claw.<br1>
I wantyou to find ten of each item.<br1>
All the creatures that I mentioned can befound in the Cruma Tower of northern Dion.<br1>
I have written down ourcontract in this document.<br1>
I know that it may seem absurd to you, but itis meant to prevent any shameful events that may take place later on.<br1>
Take it, just in case.<br1>
I will be waiting for your safe return.<br1>
