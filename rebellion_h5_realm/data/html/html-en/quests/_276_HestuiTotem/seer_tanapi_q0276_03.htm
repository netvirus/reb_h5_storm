If you kill a kasha bear, you must cut open its abdomenand take out the* kasha parasite*.<br1>
The evil spirit kasha contaminatesthe gray bears through the parasites.<br1>
But the true enemy to defeat isthe *kasha totem spirit*.<br1>
They say that the evil kasha spirit takes theform of the gray bear.<br1>
Based on my studies, *if there are enoughparasites, they will call forth the kasha totem spirit.<br1>
* I don't knowhow many are needed though.<br1>
If you kill the kasha totem spirit, the*crystal of the kasha totem spirit* will appear.<br1>
Bring it to me.<br1>
It issomething I desperately need for my studies.<br1>
If you bring it to me, Iwill reward you in the name of the Hestui.<br1>
Good luck.<br1>
