Young Orc, have you seen an animal called the *kashabear*? It is a poor animal polluted by *kasha*, the evil spirit of deathand decomposition.<br1>
Animals polluted by evil spirits die slowly becauseof the curse.<br1>
However, that is not the only problem.<br1>
The curse isterrible because it can be spread to other animals.<br1>
The gray bears arethe greatest guardian totems of the Hestui tribe.<br1>
Our tribe has beenconsecrating the gray bears since ancient times.<br1>
However, as gray bearsrecently became contaminated by the evil spirit kasha, the status of ourtribe has been trampled to the ground, and not one day passes when wecan sleep in peace.<br1>
We are working on purifying kasha bears, but I don'tthink you can take charge of this task yet.<br1>
