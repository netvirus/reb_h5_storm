Young Orc, have you seen an animal called the *kashabear*? It is a poor animal polluted by *kasha*, the evil spirit of deathand decomposition.<br1>
The animals contaminated by evil spirits die slowlybecause of the curse.<br1>
However, that is not the only problem.<br1>
The curseis terrible because it can be spread to other animals nearby.<br1>
I am theChief of the Hestui.<br1>
We Hestuis have consecrated the gray bears andserved them since ancient times.<br1>
However, as gray bears recently becamecontaminated by the evil spirit kasha, the status of our tribe has beentrampled to the ground, and not one day passes when we can sleep inpeace.<br1>
There is only one way to purify the gray bears polluted by theevil spirit kasha.<br1>
That is to kill them.<br1>
It is a difficult quest, but itis also worth undertaking.<br1>
