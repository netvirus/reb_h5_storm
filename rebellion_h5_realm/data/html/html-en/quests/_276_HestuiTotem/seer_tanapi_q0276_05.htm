You finally brought the crystal of the kasha totem spirit!Thank you.<br1>
So I was right when I said the parasites were the key tocalling forth the kasha totem spirit.<br1>
Now I must study this crystal.<br1>
Iwill make sure that we Hestuis do not forget your help.<br1>
Here -- this ismy small token of gratitude.<br1>
Please accept it.<br1>
It is a totem of ourtribe.<br1>
One day, when I discover kasha, the true source of evil, I willtrust your courage and ask you another favor.<br1>
Till then, my young Orc,may the protection of Paagrio be with you always.<br1>
