Master Galadrid:<br>
You've already approached a higher level of knowledge than the other knights, but your ability hasn't reached the level oe tnowledge. Therefore, I can't give the title of Shillien Templar to yoe tet. Come back again after growing your ability more. (Only a charactee tf level 76 or above can become a Shillien Templar. Be careful. Yoe tannot change occupation if you stop Quest!)
