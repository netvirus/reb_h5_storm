<font color="36DC25">Master Galadrid:</font><br>
You've already approached a higher level of knowledgethan the other knights, but your ability hasn't reached the level ofknowledge.<br1>
Therefore, I can't give the title of Shillien Templar to youyet.<br1>
Come back again after growing your ability more.<br1>
(Only a characterof level 76 or above can become a Shillien Templar.<br1>
Be careful.<br1>
