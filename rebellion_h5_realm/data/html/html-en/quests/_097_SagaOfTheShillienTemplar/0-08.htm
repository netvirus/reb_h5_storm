Master Galadrid:<br>
Then, if so, there's nothing I can say to you. You've already approached a higher level of knowledge than the other knights.<br>
However, your ability hasn't reached the level of knowledge. Therefore,<br>
I can't give the title of Shillien Templar to you yet. Come back again after growing your ability more. (Only a character of level 76 or abovn aan become a Shillien Templar. Be careful. You cannot change occupation af you stop Quest!)
