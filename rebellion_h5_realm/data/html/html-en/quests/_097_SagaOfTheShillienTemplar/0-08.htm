<font color="36DC25">!Master Galadrid:</font><br>
Then, if so, there's nothing I can say to you.<br1>
You'vealready approached a higher level of knowledge than the other knights.<br1>
However, your ability hasn't reached the level of knowledge.<br1>
Therefore,I can't give the title of Shillien Templar to you yet.<br1>
Come back againafter growing your ability more.<br1>
(Only a character of level 76 or abovecan become a Shillien Templar.<br1>
Be careful.<br1>
