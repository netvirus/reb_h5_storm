Welcome back! Tell me, what have you learned?The forbidden knowledge is truly passed on to the one who holds theStone of Commune.<br1>
Good job! But, why did you come back? The Stone ofCommune? You mean this? Actually, there were several fragments attachedto the tablet.<br1>
I gave you the analyzed one.<br1>
This may be the one thatyou're looking for now.<br1>
Unfortunately, it's incomplete.<br1>
You must findanother fragment! In fact, I know where the fragment is, but haven'tbeen able to get it yet, as it will be quite difficult.<br1>
