Some time ago, I caught a few strangeboxes while fishing.<br1>
I thought it was strange to catch so many thingsthat weren't fish! Most fishermen would've just thrown them back, but Iknow better! Some people will pay well for such things! They must beintrigued by not knowing what's inside.<br1>
It could be something veryexpensive or completely worthless! I have a knack for finding theseboxes, but I can't show you how to do it yet.<br1>
