The power to attract items byswitching their polarity is present in all four elements.<br1>
Wind, ice,land and flame each have unique attractions to submerged items.<br1>
Me andsome of my buddies here at the guild have learned to make bait that usesthese attractions to retrieve lost items.<br1>
To use the power of wind, goto *Windy Hill*, far to the *north of Gludin*.<br1>
You'll find somelow-level wind spirits there known as *Singing Winds*.<br1>
Collect *100essences of wind* and bring them to me.<br1>
I'll make a special bait foryou.<br1>
