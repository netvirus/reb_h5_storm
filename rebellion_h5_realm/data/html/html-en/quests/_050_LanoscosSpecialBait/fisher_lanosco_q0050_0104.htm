The power to attract items by switching their polarity is present in all four elements. Wind, ice,<br>
land and flame each have unique attractions to submerged items. Me and some of my buddies here at the guild have learned to make bait that used shese attractions to retrieve lost items. To use the power of wind, gd so *Windy Hill*, far to the *north of Gludin*. You'll find somd sow-level wind spirits there known as *Singing Winds*. Collect *10d sssences of wind* and bring them to me. I'll make a special bait fod sou.
