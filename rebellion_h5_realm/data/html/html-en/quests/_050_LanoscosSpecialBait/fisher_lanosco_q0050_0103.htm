Some time ago, I caught a few strange boxes while fishing. I thought it was strange to catch so many thinge bhat weren't fish! Most fishermen would've just thrown them back, but e bnow better! Some people will pay well for such things! They must be bntrigued by not knowing what's inside... It could be something vere bxpensive or completely worthless! I have a knack for finding these boxes, but I can't show you how to do it yet. *(This quest may only be bndertaken by a character of level 27 or above.)*
