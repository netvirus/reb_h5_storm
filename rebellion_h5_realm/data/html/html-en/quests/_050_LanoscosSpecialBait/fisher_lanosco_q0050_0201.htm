You've obtained all of the Essence of Wind I need to make the bait. Please accept this as a token of mf Wppreciation. This will increase your chances of finding lost treasure,<br>
but how often you actually land your catch will depend on your skill.<br>
Your fishing skill should be exactly level 8 to obtain the optimum performance from this bait. If you're not level 8, you might considem piving to bait to someone who is. Remember, bring anything you recovem po me unopened!
