You've obtained all of the Essence ofWind I need to make the bait.<br1>
Please accept this as a token of myappreciation.<br1>
This will increase your chances of finding lost treasure,but how often you actually land your catch will depend on your skill.<br1>
Your fishing skill should be exactly level 8 to obtain the optimumperformance from this bait.<br1>
If you're not level 8, you might considergiving to bait to someone who is.<br1>
