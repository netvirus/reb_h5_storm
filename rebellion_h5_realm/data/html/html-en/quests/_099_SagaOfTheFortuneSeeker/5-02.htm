<font color="FF8000">Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by brightlights.<br1>
While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start toacquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousandsreading scriptures in the background.<br1>
You now realize the truth of theworld and yet understand nothing.<br1>
One of the voices is a familiar femalewhisper.<br1>
But it quickly disappears.<br1>
Slowly, you begin to visualizewhere the next Stone of Commune is.<br1>
in the valley of dust.<br1>
you see asecond Tablet of Vision.<br1>
and a female warrior in platinum armor.<br1>
Sheis holding the stone.<br1>
She unfolds her wings and flies away.<br1>
andshe's not alone.<br1>
In an instant, the images disappear and then thestone goes completely dark.<br1>
