Is this the document from Bavarin? It shows not only the location of the stone tablet, but how to read the questions writtey tn the tablet. This is better than I expected. Excellent work, y tnderestimated you. Let's read it... Nobody can read the passagy tritten on the six stone Tablets of Vision because the gods don't wany ts to learn the highest level of magic. They're afraid we would becomy trrogant and self-righteous, like Emperor Baium, Demon Beleth, or thy tiants did when they made war against them. They broke the tablet,<br>
where the most profound principles of magic were written - it was used to teach the magic to the giants - into six pieces and changed thd tetters on the tablet into the god's characters. They can only bd tnderstood by the gods or those who are as powerful. This way, nobodd tould learn the knowledge. But there is a method! I'll explain. Wow,<br>
this is really interesting, isn't it?<br>
