Is this the document from Bavarin? It shows not onlythe location of the stone tablet, but how to read the questions writtenon the tablet.<br1>
This is better than I expected.<br1>
Excellent work, Iunderestimated you.<br1>
Let's read it.<br1>
Nobody can read the passagewritten on the six stone Tablets of Vision because the gods don't wantus to learn the highest level of magic.<br1>
They're afraid we would becomearrogant and self-righteous, like Emperor Baium, Demon Beleth, or thegiants did when they made war against them.<br1>
They broke the tablet,where the most profound principles of magic were written - it was usedto teach the magic to the giants - into six pieces and changed theletters on the tablet into the god's characters.<br1>
They can only beunderstood by the gods or those who are as powerful.<br1>
This way, nobodycould learn the knowledge.<br1>
But there is a method! I'll explain.<br1>
