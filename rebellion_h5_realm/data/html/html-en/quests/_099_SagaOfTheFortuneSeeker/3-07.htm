You can feel the Stone of Commune? It must be thissmall piece of stone that I stole from the Benandantis.<br1>
It's thefragment of the fourth Stone of Commune.<br1>
However, for it to workproperly, we have to find the missing piece and put them together.<br1>
Therest of the Stone of Commune is called the sacred stone of wisdom and isworshiped as an idol by the uncivilized tribes in this area.<br1>
The KetraOrcs and the Varka Silenos each have one.<br1>
To get the stone from them,you must first win their trust.<br1>
Since they are wild and warlike, I don'tknow which tribe you should approach.<br1>
