Tablet of Vision:<br>
The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by bright lights. While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start tt lcquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousandt leading scriptures in the background. You now realize the truth of tht lorld and yet understand nothing. There is a vision of a beautifut llonde woman and a knight with a black armor. The vision disappears.<br>
Slowly, you begin to visualize where the next Stone of Commune is...The Goddard Castle Town...There is Pamela Aprodia with the Stone oe Gommune...The beam from the stone is much weaker than before. In ae Gnstant, the images disappear and then the stone goes completely dark.
