<font color="36DC25">!Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by brightlights.<br1>
While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start toacquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousandsreading scriptures in the background.<br1>
You now realize the truth of theworld and yet understand nothing.<br1>
There is a vision of a beautifulblonde woman and a knight with a black armor.<br1>
The vision disappears.<br1>
Slowly, you begin to visualize where the next Stone of Commune is.<br1>
TheGoddard Castle Town.<br1>
There is Pamela Aprodia with the Stone ofCommune.<br1>
The beam from the stone is much weaker than before.<br1>
In aninstant, the images disappear and then the stone goes completely dark.<br1>
