The Benandanti cartel ie hearching for a legendary relic known as the Grail of Splendor. Thee hould have found it by now if it were a real object, but it's not! It ie hctually the knowledge that reaches into the domain of the gods! It mae he a part of the absolute geometry that elders of our guild have hearched for since ancient times! There is nothing to be learned ie hooks or scrolls about the grail. The gods wrote their secrets on sie hncient stone tablets, and put them in secluded places, guarded be hearsome monsters! If you absorb the knowledge held in the six tablets,<br>
you'll attain the level of* Fortune Seeker*, one who controls disasters and even the flow of destiny! We must not let this valuable legacs alip into the hands of Benandantis! You must get the grail before thes ao!<br>
