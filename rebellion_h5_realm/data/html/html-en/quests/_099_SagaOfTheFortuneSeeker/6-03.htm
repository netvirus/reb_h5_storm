<font color="FF8000">Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by brightlights.<br1>
While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start toacquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousandsreading scriptures in the background.<br1>
You now realize the truth of theworld and yet understand nothing.<br1>
One of the voices is a familiar femalewhisper.<br1>
But it quickly disappears.<br1>
Slowly, you sense the stone.<br1>
Yousee the third Tablet of Vision.<br1>
and an angel with two pairs ofwings.<br1>
She is holding the stone in her hand.<br1>
In an instant, theimages disappear and then the stone goes completely dark.<br1>
