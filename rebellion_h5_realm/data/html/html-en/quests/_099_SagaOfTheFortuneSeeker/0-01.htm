Do you know who I am? I'm an inspector from theBronze Key Guild, but that's just a superficial job title! What I'mabout to tell you is known by only a few people in the whole Dwarvenkingdom! Listen carefully! I won't repeat it.<br1>
The Bronze Key Guild wasoriginally formed to resist the von Hellmann family that tried to takeover the Elmore Kingdom and the Benandanti cartel that followed them.<br1>
Itwas an elite group, consisting of only Dwarves with the very bestskills.<br1>
Our guild has watched you for a long time.<br1>
We saw you pass thecruel test of Master Toma and get your Scavenger license, and when youmade 7 journeyman's rings and passed the Trial of the Guildsman.<br1>
Sometime ago, we concluded that a Dwarf with your willpower and acumendeserves to be a member of our guild.<br1>
Now I have an offer for you.<br1>
