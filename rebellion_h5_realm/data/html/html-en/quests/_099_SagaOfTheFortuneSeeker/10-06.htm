As you hold the Stone of Commune and concentrate onit, the tablet starts to be surrounded by bright light.<br1>
You hear severalhundred people simultaneously reading scriptures, and new knowledgestarts to enter your mind.<br1>
On one hand, you feel like you understandeverything.<br1>
On the other hand, you feel that you don't understandanything.<br1>
You hear someone's low-pitched laughter.<br1>
And you hear aman's voice.<br1>
"You now have one more successor that you like.<br1>
Ablonde woman replies.<br1>
"No, he's like a baby who just started walking.<br1>
But he will no longer need his mother's protection.<br1>
All imagesdisappear, and you start to recognize the surrounding environment.<br1>
Youare starting to understand the knowledge you have gained from the tabletlittle by little.<br1>
The pilgrimage of the tablet seems to have ended.<br1>
