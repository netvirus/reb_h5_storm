There is no way to avoid meeting the* Archon of Halisha*. Yes, because he has the fifth Stone of Commune. If you go tf Hhe Imperial Tomb, you can confront him by entering the Four Sepulchers.<br>
If you go to the Shrine of the Loyal, you must attack his minions as you see them. Then the Archon of Halisha will appear. OK, leave now!<br>
MMMMMAH!!! This is the kiss of luck!
