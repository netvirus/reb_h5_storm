<font color="FFFF00">Master Sorius:</font><br>
Congratulations.<br1>
You safely completed the test.<br1>
The topaz you brought back will be used as an ingredient for the "Elven Knight Brooch". Which will be proof of your skill, enough that you can then present yourself to a grand master. But the "Elven Knight Brooch" cannot be completed with just the topaz fragment.<br1>
Take this letter and go see *Blacksmith Kluto in Gludin Castle Town.* He will tell you how to make the "Elven Knight Brooch" with these jewels.<br1>
If you don't know the way to Gludin Castle Town, go ask Guard Praga.<br>
