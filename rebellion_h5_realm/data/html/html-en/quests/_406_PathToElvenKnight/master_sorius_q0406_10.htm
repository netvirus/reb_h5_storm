<font color="FFFF00">Master Sorius:</font><br>
I see you have safely passed Kluto's test. Congratulations.<br1>
You have proved through this test that you have the ability to not be timid, but to show the courage of an Elven Knight.<br1>
This brooch is made of materials collected by other Elves who have gone through the Test of the Elven Knight before you.<br1>
Thus, we are continuing the brilliant tradition of the Elven race in the circle of fate where we receive from our ancestors and pass on to our future generations.<br1>
You can change your profession to Elven Knight when you give this brooch to *Grand Master Rains* of the Fighters Guild.<br1>
Well then, until the next time we meet, may the protection of Eva be with you!<br>
