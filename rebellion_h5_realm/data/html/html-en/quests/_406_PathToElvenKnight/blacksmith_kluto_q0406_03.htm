Why have you returned so early? Were you afraid?<br1>
They are only ol mahum rookies ... You are quite a timid fellow.<br1>
If I may give you a piece of advice, don't go deep into the camp.<br1>
If the ol mahum come upon you in a group, with your skills you'd never be able to deal with them.<br1>
Do you understand what I'm saying? Well, be off now!<br>
