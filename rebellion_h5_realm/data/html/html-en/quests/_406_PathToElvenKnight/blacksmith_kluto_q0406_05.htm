Amazing! To be frank, I wasn't expecting much out of you.<br1>
Indeed, Master Sorius knows a good candidate. To tell the truth, bringing back the emeralds was also part of the test. Since Sorius saved my life long ago, I have been assisting him in testing young Elven Fighters. When we have some time, I will tell you how Sorius saved me from the Orcs. Give me the topaz pieces and emerald pieces. These jewels will be used as materials to make the brooches for the next youngsters who qualify to become Elven Knights. Your brooch has already been made from the jewels collected by those that took the test before you.<br1>
Now take this box. In it is the completed Elven Knight brooch.<br1>
Take this to *Master Sorius* and he will conduct the official presentation. You have rightfully earned it.<br>
