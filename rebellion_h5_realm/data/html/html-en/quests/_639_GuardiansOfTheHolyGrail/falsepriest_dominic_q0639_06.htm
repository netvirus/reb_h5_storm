	Priest Domini$1<br>
	<br> Here's the quest:<br>
Go to the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Monastery of Silence</font> and vanquish the monks.<br>
	I will give you a reward if you bring me the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Scripture of Monk</font> as proof that you have<br>
	defeated them. I hope, of course, that they surrender to you, but if<br>
	they do not, you may kill them in good conscience; we will pray for<br>
	their souls.<br>
	<br> Oh, here's something that may help you:<br>
we have a man on the<br>
	inside. Our brave<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Gremory</font> has managed to infiltrate the<br>
	monastery, a task many had thought impossible. Please help him to<br>
	escape if possible; the poor man has done more that enough, and he may<br>
	be of help to you.<br>
