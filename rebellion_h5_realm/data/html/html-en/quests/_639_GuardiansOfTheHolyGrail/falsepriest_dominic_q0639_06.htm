<font color="36DC25"><html><body>	Priest Dominic:</font><br>
<br> Here's the quest: Go to the	<font color="LEVEL">Monastery of Silence</font> and vanquish the monks.<br1>
I will give you a reward if you bring me the	<font color="LEVEL">Scripture of Monk</font> as proof that you have	defeated them.<br1>
I hope, of course, that they surrender to you, but if	they do not, you may kill them in good conscience; we will pray for	their souls.<br1>
<br> Oh, here's something that may help you: we have a man on the	inside.<br1>
Our brave	<font color="LEVEL">Gremory</font> has managed to infiltrate the	monastery, a task many had thought impossible.<br1>
Please help him to	escape if possible; the poor man has done more that enough, and he may	be of help to you.<br1>
