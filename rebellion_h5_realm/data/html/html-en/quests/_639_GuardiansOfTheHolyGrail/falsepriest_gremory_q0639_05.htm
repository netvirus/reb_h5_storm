	<br> Then we understand each other. Go to the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Room of Splendor</font> and<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">pour water into the Holy Grail. Then pour<br>
		that water back into a jar and bring it to me</font>. Thus can we verify the<br>
	genuineness of the Holy Grail. Be careful, though; the Grail may be<br>
	guarded.<br>
	<br> One more thing:<br>
the Room of Splendor is locked. You will need<br>
	a<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">key to enter there</font>. Some monks have such<br>
	keys to perform their duties, so I suggest that you overcome one of<br>
	them and take his key.<br>
