	Priest Domini$1<br>
	<br> Have you heard tell of a place called the Monastery of<br>
	Silence? Well, they are suspicious of strangers and quick to attack<br>
	intruders. Why? Well, there's a reason...<br>
	<br> But hold, I think it would be better to tell you this later<br>
	on, when you have grown stronger and more skillful.<br>
	<br> (Only characters level 73 and above are permitted to take on<br>
	the quest.)<br>
