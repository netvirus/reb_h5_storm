<br> What? Damn it all! I have needed an underling for so long.<br1>
<br> Well, never mind that now.<br1>
Let's talk business.<br1>
In my	searches within the monastery, I have found a	<font color="LEVEL">broken bridge</font>.<br1>
Across the bridge, there is a	chamber called the	<font color="LEVEL">Room of Splendor</font>.<br1>
<br> I don't know what the name means, but.<br1>
they say the	<font color="LEVEL">Holy Grail</font> lies within.<br1>
That's the place to	go.<br1>
