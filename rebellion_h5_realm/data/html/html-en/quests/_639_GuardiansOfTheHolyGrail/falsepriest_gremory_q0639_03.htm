	<br> What? Damn it all! I have needed an underling for so long...<br>
	<br> Well, never mind that now. Let's talk business. In my<br>
	searches within the monastery, I have found a<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">broken bridge</font>. Across the bridge, there is a<br>
	chamber called the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Room of Splendor</font>.<br>
	<br> I don't know what the name means, but... they say the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Holy Grail</font> lies within. That's the place to<br>
	go.<br>
