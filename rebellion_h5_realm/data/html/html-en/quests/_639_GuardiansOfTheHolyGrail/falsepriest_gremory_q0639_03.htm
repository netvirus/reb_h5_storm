Priest Gremor$1<br>
<br>
What? Damn it all! I have needed an underling for so long... Well, never mind that now. Let's talk business. In my searches within the monastery, I have found a<br>
<font color="LEVEL">broken bridge</font>. Across the bridge, there is a chamber called the<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Room of Splendor</font>. I don't know what the name means, but... they say the<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Holy Grail</font> lies within. That's the place to go. <a action="bypass -h Quest _639_GuardiansOfTheHolyGrail falsepriest_gremory_q0639_04.htm">"A broken bridge? How do I cross it?"</a><br>
