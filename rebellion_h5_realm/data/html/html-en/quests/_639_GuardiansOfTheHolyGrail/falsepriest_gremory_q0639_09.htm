<br> Ah, that's true, that's true.<br1>
Such a forgetfulness is rare in	a spy of my caliber, I assure you! Well, I am a man of my word, so here	you go.<br1>
I assume that takes care of our deal, yes?	<br> What's more, I'll make another deal with you: If you bring me	<font color="LEVEL">4000 or 400 Monk's Scriptures, I will		exchange then for a S-grade Enchant Weapon Scroll or a S-grade Enchant		Armor Scroll, respectively</font>.<br1>
Come back after you slay those bothersome	monks.<br1>
