	<br> Ah, that's true, that's true. Such a forgetfulness is rare in<br>
	a spy of my caliber, I assure you! Well, I am a man of my word, so here<br>
	you go. I assume that takes care of our deal, yes?<br>
	<br> What's more, I'll make another deal with you:<br>
If you bring me<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">4000 or 400 Monk's Scriptures, I will<br>
		exchange then for a S-grade Enchant Weapon Scroll or a S-grade Enchant<br>
		Armor Scroll, respectively</font>. Come back after you slay those bothersome<br>
	monks.<br>
