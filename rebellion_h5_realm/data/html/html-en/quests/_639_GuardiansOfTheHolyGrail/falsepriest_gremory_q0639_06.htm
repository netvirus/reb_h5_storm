Go to the *Room of Splendor* and *pour a measure ofwater into the Holy Grail.<br1>
Then pour the water back into a jar and bringit to me.<br1>
* We can test the water to determine if the Grail is the realthing or not.<br1>
Be careful when you do this; the room may be guarded.<br1>
Oh,another thing.<br1>
The Room of Splendor is locked, and you'll need a *key toenter it.<br1>
* Some of the monks carry a key to that room; I suggest thatyou overcome of one of them and take his key.<br1>
