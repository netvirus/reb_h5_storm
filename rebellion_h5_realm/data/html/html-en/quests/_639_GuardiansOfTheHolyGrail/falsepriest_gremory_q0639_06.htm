Go to the *Room of Splendor* and *pour a measure of water into the Holy Grail. Then pour the water back into a jar and brinf wt to me.* We can test the water to determine if the Grail is the reaf whing or not. Be careful when you do this; the room may be guarded. Oh,<br>
another thing. The Room of Splendor is locked, and you'll need a *key to enter it.* Some of the monks carry a key to that room; I suggest thao eou overcome of one of them and take his key.<br>
