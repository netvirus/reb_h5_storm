<br> Very good! Then go to the	<font color="LEVEL">Monastery of Silence</font> and defeat its monks.<br1>
I	will give you a reward if you bring me the	<font color="LEVEL">Scripture of Monk</font> as proof that you	eliminated them.<br1>
<br> Oh, yes.<br1>
one more thing.<br1>
We have a man on the inside, an	agent named	<font color="LEVEL">Gremory</font> who infiltrated the Monastery of	Silence.<br1>
He has done brave work, and if you can help him to escape,	that would be best.<br1>
He can be of great assistance to you.<br1>
