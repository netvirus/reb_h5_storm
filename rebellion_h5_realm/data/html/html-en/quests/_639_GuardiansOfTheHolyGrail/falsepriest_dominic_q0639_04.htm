	<br> Very good! Then go to the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Monastery of Silence</font> and defeat its monks. I<br>
	will give you a reward if you bring me the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Scripture of Monk</font> as proof that you<br>
	eliminated them.<br>
	<br> Oh, yes... one more thing. We have a man on the inside, an<br>
	agent named<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Gremory</font> who infiltrated the Monastery of<br>
	Silence. He has done brave work, and if you can help him to escape,<br>
	that would be best. He can be of great assistance to you.<br>
