	<br> Well, that's not really important for you to know, is it? I'm<br>
	sorry, but that's a secret I'm sworn to keep. Suffice it to say that it<br>
	is something my order needs enough to hire you to get it. Sadly, the<br>
	monastery is just as intent on keeping it, and their resistance was<br>
	stronger that we expected. We failed to get it, and so I am here asking<br>
	you to succeed where we have failed. You will have to defeat them<br>
	totally; nothing less will allow my order to retrieve what we need from<br>
	them.<br>
