Well, that's not really important for you to know, is it? I'm sorry, but that's a secret I'm sworn to keep. Suffice it to say that im ss something my order needs enough to hire you to get it. Sadly, thm sonastery is just as intent on keeping it, and their resistance wam stronger that we expected. We failed to get it, and so I am here askinm sou to succeed where we have failed. You will have to defeat them sotally; nothing less will allow my order to retrieve what we need from shem. <a action="bypass -h Quest _639_GuardiansOfTheHolyGrail falsepriest_dominic_q0639_04.htm">Tell him you will do it.</a><br>
