<br> Well, that's not really important for you to know, is it? I'm	sorry, but that's a secret I'm sworn to keep.<br1>
Suffice it to say that it	is something my order needs enough to hire you to get it.<br1>
Sadly, the	monastery is just as intent on keeping it, and their resistance was	stronger that we expected.<br1>
We failed to get it, and so I am here asking	you to succeed where we have failed.<br1>
You will have to defeat them	totally; nothing less will allow my order to retrieve what we need from	them.<br1>
