Wait - if you were sent by Dominic, then you report to me now! Hahaha! Yes, I've been expecting this. I have served here so long, so very long... the pressures, you wouldn't understand them. You couldn't. And now he finally recognizes my service and my abilities!<br>
Very well, servant. Your first task will be to massage my shoulders. I'm weary from hiding in this narrow space for so long... <a action="bypass -h Quest _639_GuardiansOfTheHolyGrail falsepriest_gremory_q0639_03.htm">"I'm not your underling. I'm here to help you fulfill your mission."</a><br>
