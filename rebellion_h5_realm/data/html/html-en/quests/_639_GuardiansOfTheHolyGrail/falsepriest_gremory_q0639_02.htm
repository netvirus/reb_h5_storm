<br> I infiltrated this order to find the	<font color="LEVEL">Grail of Splendor</font> they keep hidden here in	the Monastery of Silence.<br1>
Now that's a mission for a man! I wouldn't	blame you for envying me.<br1>
<br> Wait - if you were sent by Dominic, then you report to me	now! Hahaha! Yes, I've been expecting this.<br1>
I have served here so long,	so very long.<br1>
the pressures, you wouldn't understand them.<br1>

And now he finally recognizes my service and my abilities!	<br> Very well, servant.<br1>
Your first task will be to massage my	shoulders.<br1>
I'm weary from hiding in this narrow space for so long.<br1>
