	Priest Gremor$1<br>
	<br> I infiltrated this order to find the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Grail of Splendor</font> they keep hidden here in<br>
	the Monastery of Silence. Now that's a mission for a man! I wouldn't<br>
	blame you for envying me.<br>
	<br> Wait - if you were sent by Dominic, then you report to me<br>
	now! Hahaha! Yes, I've been expecting this. I have served here so long,<br>
	so very long... the pressures, you wouldn't understand them. You<br>
	couldn't. And now he finally recognizes my service and my abilities!<br>
	<br> Very well, servant. Your first task will be to massage my<br>
	shoulders. I'm weary from hiding in this narrow space for so long...<br>
