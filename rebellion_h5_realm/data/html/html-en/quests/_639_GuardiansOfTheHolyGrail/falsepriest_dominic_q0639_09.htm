<br> Oh, very well, I can't make you do it.<br1>
But do be careful,	now; I wouldn't want to see you side with those pestilential monks.<br1>
Who	knows what might happen to you if you did? You might just.<br1>
die, of	remorse and shame.<br1>
Heh.<br1>
<br> If you change your mind, you know where to find me.<br1>
