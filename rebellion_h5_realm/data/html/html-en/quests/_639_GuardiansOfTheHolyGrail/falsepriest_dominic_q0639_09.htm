	<br> Oh, very well, I can't make you do it. But do be careful,<br>
	now; I wouldn't want to see you side with those pestilential monks. Who<br>
	knows what might happen to you if you did? You might just... die, of<br>
	remorse and shame. Heh.<br>
	<br> If you change your mind, you know where to find me.<br>
