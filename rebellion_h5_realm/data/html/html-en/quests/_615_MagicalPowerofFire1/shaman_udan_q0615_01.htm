Do you feel the power of Asefa engulfing thebattleground, comrade? You must go to the Ketra Orc Outpost and stealthe Red Totem, the source of his power.<br1>
You mustn't confront it'sguardians directly! If they discover you, you'll never get the totem.<br1>
Once you do this, I'll give you the *Divine Stone of Wisdom*, a sacredrelic of our tribe! The Red Totem is locked inside a box, so don'tforget to take the Key of Thief with you.<br1>
