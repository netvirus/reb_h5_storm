My family .<br1>
We built a house near the waterfall and lived happily, tending our fields.<br1>
Then suddenly, one day, an Elven militia corps showed up and threatened us, but we didn't pay much attention because we though it was just the normal harassment.<br1>
But the day I wentup to repair the roof for the rainy season, they swarmed into the house and killed my entire family .<br1>
I was a powerless coward, and I held my breath on the roof and just watched.<br1>
As my family was killed one by one in front of my eyes, I pressed myself close to the roof so that I wouldnot be seen, and did nothing to save them until they were all dead .<br1>
What sins did I commit for my family to be murdered! I will take revenge on those Elves by doing exactly what they did! I will make the munderst and how it feels to be able to do nothing while your loved ones die in front of your eyes! Ahh .<br1>
My family...<br1>
Could you do me afavor? It's nothing difficult.<br1>
