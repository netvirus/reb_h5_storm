The Dark Forest is peaceful and orderly, but Gludio is notlike that.<br1>
The wounds of war still run red in that place.<br1>
A Sorcerer inthe past went mad, and did things that should not have been done.<br1>
Hemade live Humans the subjects of his experiments.<br1>
After the experiments,they were no longer Humans.<br1>
The scientist turned them into skeletons,you see.<br1>
*Kill the skeleton scouts in the Ruins of Agony in Gludio andfind the Heart of Lunacy, left by that Sorcerer whose lunacy created theevil.<br1>
* Here is a perfume made from crushed herbs, it will defend yourmind from the curse of that madness.<br1>
