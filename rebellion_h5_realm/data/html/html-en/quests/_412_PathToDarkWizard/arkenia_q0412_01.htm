The Dark Forest is peaceful and orderly, but Gludio is not like that.<br1>
The wounds of war still run red in that place.<br1>
A Sorcerer in the past went mad, and did things that should not have been done.<br1>
He made live Humans the subjects of his experiments.<br1>
After the experiments,they were no longer Humans.<br1>
The scientist turned them into skeletons,you see.<br1>
*Kill the skeleton scouts in the Ruins of Agony in Gludio and find the Heart of Lunacy, left by that Sorcerer whose lunacy created the evil.<br1>
* Here is a perfume made from crushed herbs, it will defend your mind from the curse of that madness.<br>
