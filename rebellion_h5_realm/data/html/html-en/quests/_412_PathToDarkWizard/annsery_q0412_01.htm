The finest Wizards of the Dark Elven race used to study black magic here a long time ago.<br1>
But this place has since been abandoned and is now in ruins.<br1>
Can't you feel the spirit of evil inside? The accumulated dark magic is so strong, even a Fighter like myself can feel its power.<br1>
I am training to become a sentry.<br1>
The training course involves exploring the School of Dark Arts here.<br1>
However, whenever I go into dark and closed spaces, I cannot breathe.<br1>
Just the thought of going into that place steals my breath.<br1>
I beg you.<br1>
Please help me complete my training.<br1>
