This must be handled very carefully.<br1>
If you are careless, it will burst.<br1>
This heart is an important ingredient in the making of medicine.<br1>
This much will make alot of medicine.<br1>
If you dry one of these hearts, it will become a Seed of Lunacy.<br1>
Since you found all the hearts, I will give you a *Seed ofLunacy* as a reward.<br1>
If you carry this with you, you will not be tormented by evil creatures.
