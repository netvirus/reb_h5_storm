I didn't think it would be easy to find all the remains of my family.<br1>
I know the marsh is quite large.<br1>
They say that the Marsh Zombies love dead bodies, so I'm sure they have scattered the corpses of my family.<br1>
I do not care how long it takes.<br1>
Please find their remains.<br1>
Please, I beg you.<br>
