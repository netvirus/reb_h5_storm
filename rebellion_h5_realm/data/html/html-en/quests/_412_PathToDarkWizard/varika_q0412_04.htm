I see you already have the Jewel of Darkness.<br1>
That means you are qualified to become a Dark Wizard.<br1>
Take the jewel and go to a GrandMaster of the Dark Elf Guild in Gludio.<br1>
The closest is the village ofGludin.<br1>
Follow the road and continue on south.<br1>
Go to the Gludin Village here and meet *Grand Master Xenos*.<br1>
He will change your profession to Dark Wizard.<br>
