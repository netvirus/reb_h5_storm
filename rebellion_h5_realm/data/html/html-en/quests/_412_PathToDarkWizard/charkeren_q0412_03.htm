Those wretched murderers threw the corpses of my family inthe *marsh*, but I can't bear to go there to search.<br1>
If I could devour those murderers like a wild beast, it still wouldn't satisfy my hunger for revenge! Please find the bodies of my parents and younger sister.<br1>
I beg you.<br1>
The Marsh Zombies have probably torn up the corpses.<br1>
*Kill theMarsh Zombies and bring back the three remains, please.<br1>
* This key was given to me by my parents as a gift.<br1>
It is supposed to bring good luck.<br1>
Carry this with you.<br>
