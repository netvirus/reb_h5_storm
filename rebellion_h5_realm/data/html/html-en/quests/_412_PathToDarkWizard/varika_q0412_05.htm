Dark Wizards can control the power of nature and performpowerful magic.<br1>
But you should be aware of the origin of power thatenables magic.<br1>
Long ago, our mother Shilen was insulted by Einhasad andbetrayed by the Elves when they began to serve Eva.<br1>
Since then, theorigin of our power is darkness, like our mother Shilen.<br1>
Dark powerconsists of four factors -- *anger, despair, horror and lunacy.<br1>
* You canqualify to become a Dark Wizard only if you collect the four seeds thatsymbolize these things.<br1>
Here, take this.<br1>
This is the *Seed of Despair.<br1>
*Take this and find the remaining seeds.<br1>
