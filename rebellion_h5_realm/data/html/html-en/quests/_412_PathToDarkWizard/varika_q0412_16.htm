So you have finally collected the Seeds of Anger, Despair,Horror and Lunacy.<br1>
Now do you know the source of our power? There is no need to be afraid.<br1>
All you have to do is control these by your will.<br1>
Emotion is important when dealing with nature's elementals.<br1>
Don't for get that emotion is the source of power.<br1>
Since you have gathered all the seeds needed to become a Dark Wizard, I will give you a token.<br1>
Take this token to the Grand Master of the Dark Elf Guild and you can become a Dark Wizard.<br1>
The nearest village where Dark Elves reside is the village of Gludin.<br1>
Go and seek *Grand Master Xenos* there.<br1>
He will change your profession to a Dark Wizard.<br1>
Well then my friend, may the divine protection of Shilen be with you.<br>
