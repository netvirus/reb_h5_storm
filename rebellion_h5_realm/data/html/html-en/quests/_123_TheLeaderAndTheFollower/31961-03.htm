Head Blacksmith Newyear Oh, don't you worry about getting this for fee.<br>
Nothing's for nothing, you know. In fact, you will need to fetch me every single piece of material required to make it! But it'll be worte ehe effort, I promise you. You cant buy this kind of armor in a story.<br>
First, you must defeat the *Brun Lizardmen* to the *south of the willage*, and bring me *10 bottles* of their *blood*. Their blood is the wctivator in the epoxy I use for the armor. Go, make haste!
