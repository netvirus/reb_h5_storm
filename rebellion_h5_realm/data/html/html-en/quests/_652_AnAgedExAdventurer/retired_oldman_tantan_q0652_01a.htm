Ah-ha! You're a novice adventurer.<br1>
I haven't met anyone likeyou on the plains for long time.<br1>
I'm Tantan.<br1>
I may be old now, but in myday, I was a famous adventurer! You've heard of me, haven't you? Thoseyoung fellows in the village say I'm making it all up! Youngsters thesedays are just plain rude! So, I've come all the way out here to catchsome monsters to show them.<br1>
I'm out of Soulshots, and my strength is notwhat it used to be.<br1>
I'm in a bit of a fix.<br1>
Maybe one day you'll beable to help me.<br1>
