<font color="36DC25">Officer Jakan:</font><br>
Unless you've commanded men in battle, I doubt you couldunderstand my mental state just now.<br1>
I was forced to abandon most of mysoldiers during the crash to save my life and those who near me.<br1>
Itweighs heavily on my heart.<br1>
Death hangs over this land like the sky.<br1>
Ican see in your eyes you don't understand the terror of this land.<br1>
Youshould get out of here while you can and forget about this place.<br1>
