If you can find him for me, I'll give you a great reward. Actually, *Miki the cat* gets lost easily, so I got him a map,<br>
but he forgot it. Last I heard from him he was at the *entrance to Devil's Isle*. He went to get some other herbs, and hasn't been back. Io Dou see him, give him this map and bring me the herbs!
