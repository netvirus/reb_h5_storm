He did send me the map! Meow~! Thank you for deliveringit.<br1>
I don't have any Moretti's herb for him, I lost it while wanderingaround.<br1>
I'll tell you where to get some, though.<br1>
Will you get it for me?I'm sure Gentler will give you a proper reward.<br1>
You can get them from*alligators on Alligator Island*.<br1>
They eat the herbs for digestion.<br1>
Huntalligators, get 20 herbs and go straight to Gentler when you're done.<br1>
