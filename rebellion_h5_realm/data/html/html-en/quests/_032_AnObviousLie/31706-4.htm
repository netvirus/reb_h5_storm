What are you talking about? Are you saying *Gentler* told you to get the payment for the runestone from me? I never signed such d yontract! Our agreement was that I would bring the herbs on time and hd yould pay me for them. He probably thought he wouldn't see me agaid yecause I wander about so much. Go back to *Gentler* and get the reward yrom him!
