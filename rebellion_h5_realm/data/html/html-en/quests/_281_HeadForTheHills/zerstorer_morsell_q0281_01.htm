Since our island was opened to the outside world, wehave seen a dramatic increase in the number of goods and people landingat our port.<br1>
In fact, the road connecting it to our village has nowbecome one of the island's major thoroughfares.<br1>
Unfortunately, all thetraffic has also attracted monsters from the Hills of Gold; thecreatures are coming down to attack caravans and feast on unwarytravelers.<br1>
We do not have the manpower to dispatch an armed force toclear the Hills of Gold, but I have been authorized to hire adventurersto help deal with the situation.<br1>
