<br> Do you know what powers the Airships? It's ancient Giant	technology.<br1>
But you need	<font color="LEVEL">Star Stones</font> to power, maintain and repair a	Airship.<br1>
They can only be found in the skies of Gracia.<br1>
It's not easy	to collect these stones, especially since they tend to attract some	rather nasty monsters.<br1>
But don't you think they're worth the risk,	given their rarity and value?	<br> I think you've got all the makings of a fine Star Stone	collector, actually.<br1>
What do you say? Will you do it?	<br>	<a action="bypass -h Quest _10274_CollectingInTheAir 32557-03.<br1>
htm">Say		yes.<br1>
