	<br> Do you know what powers the Airships? It's ancient Giant<br>
	technology. But you need<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Star Stones</font> to power, maintain and repair a<br>
	Airship. They can only be found in the skies of Gracia. It's not easy<br>
	to collect these stones, especially since they tend to attract some<br>
	rather nasty monsters. But don't you think they're worth the risk,<br>
	given their rarity and value?<br>
	<br> I think you've got all the makings of a fine Star Stone<br>
	collector, actually. What do you say? Will you do it?<br>
