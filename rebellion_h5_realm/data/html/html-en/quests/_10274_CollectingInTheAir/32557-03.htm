	Engineer Leko$1<br>
	<br> It would be easier if I went with you, but unfortunately I'm<br>
	far too busy. I've prepared this<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Star Stone Collection Scroll</font> to help<br>
	beginners like you. Use it near a target and you'll do fine. It's not<br>
	cheap, though, so I hope you'll learn the collection skill while using<br>
	it.<br>
	<br> Your task is to bring me 8 of the following Extracted Star<br>
	Stones- either<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">8 Extracted Coarse Red Star Stones, 8<br>
		Extracted Coarse Blue Star Stones, or 8 Extracted Coarse Green Star<br>
		Stones</font> using the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Star Stone Collection Scrolls</font>.<br>
	<br> These star stones can be found in the skies around the<br>
	Keucereus Alliance Base and on the paths to the Seeds and the Aerial<br>
	Cleft. Good luck!<br>
