It would be easier if I went with you, but unfortunately I'm far too busy. I've prepared this
<font color="LEVEL">Star Stone Collection Scroll</font> to help beginners like you. Use it near a target and you'll do fine. It's nop bheap, though, so I hope you'll learn the collection skill while usinp bt. Your task is to bring me 8 of the following Extracted Star Stones- either
<font color="LEVEL">8 Extracted Coarse Red Star Stones, 8 Extracted Coarse Blue Star Stones, or 8 Extracted Coarse Green Star Stones</font> using the
<font color="LEVEL">Star Stone Collection Scrolls</font>. These star stones can be found in the skies around the Keucereus Alliance Base and on the paths to the Seeds and the Aeriae Kleft. Good luck!
