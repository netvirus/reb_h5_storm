<font color="36DC25">Prefect Brukurse:</font><br>
This Immortal Plateau has been the holiest land ofthe Orcs since ancient times! The place where our progenitor -- made bythe great Paagrio of flame -- took his first steps, is none other thanthe Immortal Plateau.<br1>
However, there is a group of fools that will notunderstand that this land belongs to us.<br1>
These wolfmen call themselves*maraku* and challenge us for our land.<br1>
The Paagrio Lord Kakai sent anenvoy to the wolfmen and politely asked them to leave this land! Butthey replied to his civil request by returning the envoy's head! Howdare they repay our good will with blood! Blood for blood! As thingshave turned out this way, I of course cannot let a single werewolf live.<br1>
The wolfmen brought this upon themselves! The lord has ordered us topunish these rash fools without pity.<br1>
