This Immortal Plateau has been the holiest of landsfor the Orcs since ancient times! The place where our progenitor -- madeby the great Paagrio of flame -- took his first steps, is none otherthan the Immortal Plateau.<br1>
However, there is a group of fools thatrefuses to understand that this land belongs to us.<br1>
These wolfmen callthemselves *maraku* and challenge us for our land.<br1>
The Paagrio LordKakai sent an envoy to the wolfmen and asked them to leave this land!But they replied to his civil request by returning the envoy's head! Wewill mercilessly punish those who repay our good will with blood! I lookat your eyes and I can tell that your blood is boiling with angeralready! However, if you wish to fight for the dignity of your race, youmust first be acknowledged as an Orc Fighter.<br1>
