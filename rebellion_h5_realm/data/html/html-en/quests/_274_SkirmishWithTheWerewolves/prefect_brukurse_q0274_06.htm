Tejakar Oroka! Well done indeed, my young Orc! Thecrude item in your hand is a totem worshipped by the wolfmen! That is agreat war trophy to commemorate this battle.<br1>
But if you are notinterested in trophies, you can sell it to the merchants.<br1>
I heard somebrothers will pay a fortune to get those trophies, maybe to show offtheir valor! The severed heads of the werewolves that you have broughtback will be skewered on spears and placed outside the village.<br1>
We willshow the world the consequences of daring to challenge our race! But themaraku wolfmen will not retreat so easily! This is not the end of thewar against them.<br1>
