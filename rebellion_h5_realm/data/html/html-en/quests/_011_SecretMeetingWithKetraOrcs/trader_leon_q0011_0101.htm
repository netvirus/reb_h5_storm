All right.<br1>
Guard Cadmon sent you here, didn't he? I'm gladyou made it here.<br1>
A number of young men have tried to come here, butthey all ran away even before they reached the Orc Barracks.<br1>
I'vesustained a great loss.<br1>
As you know, the Ketra Orcs are the most daringand ferocious tribe.<br1>
They never lag behind in terms of body structure orstrength.<br1>
So those who are weak run away at the sight of those orcs,causing me a great deal of trouble.<br1>
But since Cadmon sent you here andyou seem to possess great skills, I guess I don't have to worry aboutthat.<br1>
The task is simple.<br1>
Take this box of supplies to the Ketra Orcoutpost and deliver them to *Messenger Wahkan*.<br1>
It won't be difficult tofind Wahkan since he's staying in the base center.<br1>
Although it may be alittle difficult to enter the base.<br1>
