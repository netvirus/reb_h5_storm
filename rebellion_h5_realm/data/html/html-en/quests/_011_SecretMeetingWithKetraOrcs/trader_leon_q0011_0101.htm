All right. Guard Cadmon sent you here, didn't he?<br1>
I'm glad you made it here. A number of young men have tried to come here, but they all ran away even before they reached the Orc Barracks.<br1>
I've sustained a great loss. As you know, the Ketra Orcs are the most daring and ferocious tribe.<br1>
They never lag behind in terms of body structure or strength.<br1>
So those who are weak run away at the sight of those orcs, causing me a great deal of trouble.<br1>
But since Cadmon sent you here and you seem to possess great skills, I guess I don't have to worry about that.<br1>
The task is simple. Take this box of supplies to the Ketra Orc outpost and deliver them to *Messenger Wahkan*.<br1>
It won't be difficult to find Wahkan since he's staying in the base center.<br1>
Although it may be a little difficult to enter the base...<br>
