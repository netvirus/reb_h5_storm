Everyone knows that the best meat can only befound from the animals on this land.<br1>
I’ve done all I can to keep themsafe, but these Sel Mahum<font color=LEVEL>Farm Ravagers and Farm Bandits</font>are starting to be too much for me.<br1>
In fact, I would be overwhelmed ifthey all attacked at once.<br1>
There wouldn’t be anything I could do toprotect my life’s work.<br1>
When everything a man knows is threatened.<br1>
