Mighty kind of you. Tell you what... I’ll pay you for killing those Sel Mahum<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Farm Ravagers or Farm Bandits</font> on my farm. I wish I could take your word for it, but I’m gonna need to see some proof before I pay you. Collect<br>
<font color="LEVEL">300</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Sel Mahum Manes</font> and bring them back as proof. A word of warning though... some Sel Mahum can’t grow Manes, so it might take you some time before you find one that does. Best of luck, stranger.
