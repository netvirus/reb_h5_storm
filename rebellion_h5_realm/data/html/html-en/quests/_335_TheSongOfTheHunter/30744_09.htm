So, you wish to take the 2-circle huntinglicense test? Well I suppose you're up to giving it a try.<br1>
As before, inthe 2-circle test you must bring back at least three items written onthe list.<br1>
Of course, these items will be harder to obtain than those ofthe 1-circle test.<br1>
Maybe you should look at the list first.<br1>
