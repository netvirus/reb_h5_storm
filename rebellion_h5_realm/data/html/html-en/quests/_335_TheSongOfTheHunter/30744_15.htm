You wish to leave the guild? Certainly youknow that is impossible.<br1>
Once you join this brotherhood you are in forlife.<br1>
Didn't you know that?.<br1>
You should reconsider your decision.<br1>
.<br1>
The fear in your eyes makes it impossible for me to keep a straightface! I'm joking, you idiot! Of course you can leave if that is what youreally want.<br1>
You must have a good reason.<br1>
