We get dozens of hunting requests every day.<br1>
You should see *Guild Member Tor*, he will know what requests have comein.<br1>
If there is a job that you like, you can accept it.<br1>
Hunters are alsohired by individuals, not just through the guild.<br1>
Recently *Cybellin*asked me to introduce him to a trustworthy hunter.<br1>
