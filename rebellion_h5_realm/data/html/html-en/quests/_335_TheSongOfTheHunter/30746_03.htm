Excellent! Take this *Blood Crystal* and dagger.<br1>
Use thedagger to kill the evil *leto lizardmen* and *harit lizardmen* and thecrystal to absorb their blood.<br1>
This will raise the purity of the crystalabove its current level of 1.<br1>
Although this may seem quite simple, theprocess is not without risks.<br1>
In addition to the danger posed by thelizardmen, there is a chance each time that the crystal will shatter,that is, the crystal will either increase in purity or be destroyed.<br1>
Ifyou successfully raise the purity of the crystal and bring it to me, youshall receive a reward.<br1>
The higher the level of purity, the greater yourreward will be.<br1>
There are different theories as to why the crystalreacts like this to the blood of the lizardmen, possibly it is becausethese evil lizards are descended from dragons! You will find thatcertain grades of blood are very effective and others have no effect atall.<br1>
This can only be determined by trial and error.<br1>
I have writtendown this task for you.<br1>
