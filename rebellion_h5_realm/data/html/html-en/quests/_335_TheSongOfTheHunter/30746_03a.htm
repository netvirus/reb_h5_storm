After you kill the *leto lizardmen* and *harit lizardmen*with that dagger, you must use the Blood Crystal to absorb their blood.<br1>
When you raise the purity of the crystal and return it to me, I shallgive you a reward.<br1>
The higher the level of purity, the greater yourreward will be.<br1>
There is an element of risk, however, as each time it ispossible that the crystal will be destroyed.<br1>
You will find that certaingrades of blood are useful and some grades have no effect at all on theBlood Crystal.<br1>
This can only be determined by trial and error.<br1>
