You must kill the three evil outlaw Hakabrothers and bring back their heads.<br1>
They are named *Haka, Jakja andMarka*.<br1>
They are prefects of the Breka orc tribe.<br1>
They wantonly attackmerchants' carriages, massacre citizens and set fire to their homes.<br1>
There has been a bounty placed by on their heads by the Lord of Giran,therefore they have been laying low.<br1>
But with the *Breka Orc Warriors*destroyed, they are bound to appear seeking revenge.<br1>
