Did I hurt your feelings? Do you actuallyintend to try for the hunting license? If so, you must listen carefullyto my words.<br1>
There are two types of hunters.<br1>
Most hunters are1-circle, but very skillful ones can obtain the 2-circle license bypassing another test.<br1>
Of course you must take the *1-circle licensetest* first.<br1>
To pass this test, you must bring back at least three ofthe items on this list.<br1>
