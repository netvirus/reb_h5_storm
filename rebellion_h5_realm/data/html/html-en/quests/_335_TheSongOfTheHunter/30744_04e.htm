You must gather *20 light-blue runestones*.<br1>
These runestones are obtained by destroying *manashen gargoyles orenchanted stone golems* in the area near the Ivory Tower.<br1>
To protecttheir precious tower from interlopers, the mages apparently haveinplanted runestones in the creatures of that area and are controllingthem.<br1>
This is all I will say on this matter.<br1>
If you are a true hunter,you must gather the information and find the items yourself.<br1>
