Do you know the story of the seventeen heroes who challengedthe Land Dragon Antharas? It's fascinating! Such a heroic sacrifice! Itcould be an epic poem! In fact, it's one of my all-time favoritestories! It's what motivated me to become a bohemian poet! It's alwaysbeen my dream to write a great epic poem tying all the pieces of thisstory together.<br1>
Unfortunately, I only know a few fragments of it that Iheard from my grandfather.<br1>
I'm trying to collect everything I can aboutthis story.<br1>
I'm looking for someone who can help me.<br1>
