The Echo Crystal is a fragile object and iseasily broken.<br1>
This one is worn out after so many years, and needs to berestored.<br1>
It's delicate work requiring specialized tools.<br1>
I'll need thelong and sturdy claws of Malruk succubi from the Dragon Valley.<br1>
Bring meten sharp claws.<br1>
