My granddaughter Kassandra suffers from a grave illness.<br1>
Shewas always weak, but her nightmares are robbing her of what littlestrength she has left.<br1>
She was born with a special gift to foresee thefuture in her dreams.<br1>
Ogmar thinks you might be able to help, so I askedyou to come.<br1>
He knows all the details, talk to him.<br1>
