Have you heard the song about King Raul and the 5 clan memberswho helped him to unify the kingdom? Everyone in Aden knows that one!I'm afraid many of the details have been lost to history.<br1>
It was abeautiful song, sung by the bards in the time of King Raul.<br1>
Now it'sbeen forgotten.<br1>
I've heard that a Dwarven artisan in Heine has capturedthe song in an Echo Crystal.<br1>
He's known as a Melody Maestro.<br1>
Find himand bring me the crystal.<br1>
It will be a great help.<br1>
