Of the seventeen of us, the Elf WitchBaraham was best at telling stories and keeping records.<br1>
She keptjournals even during our difficult travels.<br1>
She can tell you where tofind what Talien is looking for.<br1>
One problem remains, she has turnedinto an evil creature and can't tell the stories anymore.<br1>
She's the onlyone who knows what really happened, and it's heart-breaking.<br1>
There ishope yet.<br1>
She still has the records.<br1>
Find her in a cave in the Bee Hivearea and take them from her.<br1>
That's all I know.<br1>
