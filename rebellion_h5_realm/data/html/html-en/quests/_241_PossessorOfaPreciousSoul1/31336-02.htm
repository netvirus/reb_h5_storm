Excellent! I need a very rare herb called CrimsonMoss that can only be gathered once a year.<br1>
I can tell you an easy wayto get it, however.<br1>
Go to the Swamp of Screams east of here and kill theSplinter Stakatos.<br1>
Cut them open and you'll find the herb! I must havefive units of it.<br1>
