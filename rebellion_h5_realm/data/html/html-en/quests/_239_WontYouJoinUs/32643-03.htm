To the north of us lies the Helvetica DevelopmentBase.<br1>
Surrounding this you'll find *Waste Landfill Machines*.<br1>
Besidesbeing detrimental to the environment, these machines also have somethingto do with the Mucrokians.<br1>
However, at this point, we are unsure aboutthe correlation between the two.<br1>
All we know is that these machinesstand in the way or our purpose.<br1>
We can't possibly hope to restore thiswonderous land until they have been destroyed.<br1>
Please do your part anddestroy *10 Waste Landfill Machines*.<br1>
Bring back 10 pieces from thesecontraptions as proof of the deed.<br1>
