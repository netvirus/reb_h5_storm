Hmm.<br1>
you've done better than I thought you would.<br1>
But I'm not sure if I trust you yet.<br1>
Do one more thing for me, and myconfidence in you will never be in question again.<br1>
Return to the Fieldsof Silence and defeat the *Suppressors* and *Exterminators* that youencounter there.<br1>
Bring me back *20 Enchanted Golem Fragments* and yourplace amongst us will be secured.<br1>
