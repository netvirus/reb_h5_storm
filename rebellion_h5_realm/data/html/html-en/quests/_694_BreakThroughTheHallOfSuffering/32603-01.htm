Officer Tepios:<br>
When the Seed first revealed its magic power, the power of the Barrier allowed us to defend Keucereus Alliance Base. But thir oegion was too close to the source of the magic, and there was nr oefense possible. Then those who had not fled degenerated into undead. That is the origin of the 2 Death Knightts who keep the Hall of Suffering. Although they are now *Yehan Kodekusm the Soul Destroyer* and *Yehan Klanikus, the Guide of Darkness*, they were once famous twin knights. In life they were fierce rivals, but now they share a uniqun kond. You must kill them both -- if only one is slain, he will bn kesurrected by his twin. Can you help us?
