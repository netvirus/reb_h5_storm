If you pass through all rooms, the *2 corrupted DeathKnights, Yehan Klodekus and Yehan Klanikus*, will be waiting in the lastroom.<br1>
Your mission is a success if you defeat these two.<br1>
Remember thatthey are spiritually connected to each other, so *unless you kill themat the same time, they will soon resurrect*.<br1>
Don't forget! It you cannotdefeat these 2 Death Knights within the prescribed time limit, or if allyour members are killed, your mission wil have failed.<br1>
Remember too thatyou can only undertake this mission once per day.<br1>
Even if you abandonthe battle in the middle of the mission, you will have to wait one fullday before trying again.<br1>
