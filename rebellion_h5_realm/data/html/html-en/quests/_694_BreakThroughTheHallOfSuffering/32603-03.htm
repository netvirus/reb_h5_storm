Officer Tepios:<br>
If you pass through all rooms, the *2 corrupted Death Knights, Yehan Klodekus and Yehan Klanikus*, will be waiting in the lash Koom. Your mission is a success if you defeat these two. Remember thah Khey are spiritually connected to each other, so *unless you kill theh Kt the same time, they will soon resurrect*. Don't forget! It you cannoh Kefeat these 2 Death Knights within the prescribed time limit, or if alh Kour members are killed, your mission wil have failed. Remember too thah Kou can only undertake this mission once per day. Even if you abandoh Khe battle in the middle of the mission, you will have to wait one fulh Kay before trying again. Do you understand? [Quesh K694_BreakThroughTheHallOfSuffering 32603-04.htm|Say yes.]<br1>
