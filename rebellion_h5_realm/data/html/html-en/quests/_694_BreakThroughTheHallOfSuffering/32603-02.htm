I will tell you about the area you will enter and whatyou must do there.<br1>
The Hall of Suffering consists of 5 consecutiverooms.<br1>
Each room has a *Tumor of Death* guarded by various monsters.<br1>
Youmust *deactivate* this Tumor.<br1>
Once you have done so, it will become a*Destroyed Tumor*.<br1>
Of course, the monsters will try to stop you.<br1>
Oncethe Tumors in all 5 rooms are deactivated, you may proceed.<br1>
But I leaveit up to you wherher to face the monsters or the Tumors first.<br1>
Remember,even if you destroy the Tumor, the nearbly monsters won't simplydisappear.<br1>
