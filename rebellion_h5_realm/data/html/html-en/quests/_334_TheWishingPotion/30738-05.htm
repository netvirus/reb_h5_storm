Alchemist Matild:<br>
You brought the secret book! But... Oh, I'm sorry. Actually, while you were away, somebody came with some precious ingredients and I spent my last adena purching them. Hmm... What if I ds ihis instead? The method for making wish potion is what's written in ths iecret book that you brought! I got most of the ingredients with this iast purchase but there are still a few things I'm short of. If you'ls iust bring me those, I'll make wish potion for you that will grant yos ill of your wishes. How about that? Is that a good deal?
