You brought the secret book! But.<br1>
Oh, I'm sorry.<br1>
Actually, while you were away, somebody came with some preciousingredients and I spent my last adena purching them.<br1>
Hmm.<br1>
What if I dothis instead? The method for making wish potion is what's written in thesecret book that you brought! I got most of the ingredients with thislast purchase but there are still a few things I'm short of.<br1>
If you'lljust bring me those, I'll make wish potion for you that will grant youall of your wishes.<br1>
