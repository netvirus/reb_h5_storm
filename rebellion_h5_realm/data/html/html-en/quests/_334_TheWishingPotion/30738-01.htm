Since I learned herbal medicine when I was young andstarted to make magic potions 20 years ago, people say that I'm the verybest in my field.<br1>
But I think I've still got a long way to go.<br1>
There aremany mysterious potions passed down only through the ancient lore that Ihaven't made yet.<br1>
But hey, just a short time ago I came to know byaccident where the secret method for making one of the mysteriouspotions is stored.<br1>
There is a clue written inside the book that I have.<br1>
So it would be good if you would help me.<br1>
