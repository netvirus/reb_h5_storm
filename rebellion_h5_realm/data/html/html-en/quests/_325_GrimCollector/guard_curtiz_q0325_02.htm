If you are thinking of going to the ruins, I can give youan errand that you will find rewarding.<br1>
Just recently, I spoke with*Samed*, who lives near the edge of the village .<br1>
He asked me to refera few skilled friends to him, when guards or mercenary soldier troopswere dispatched near the ruins.<br1>
I myself have helped him out a fewtimes.<br1>
The job is a little unpleasant, but .<br1>
the pay is good.<br1>
