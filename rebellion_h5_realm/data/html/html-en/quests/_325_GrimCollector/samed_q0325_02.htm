Hmm? So you came to me for a job.<br1>
Well, are you thinking ofgoing to the ruins? If you find me a few things from there, I willgenerously reward you afterwards.<br1>
Though I am not sure whether you willcome back alive from that place which crawls with zombies and skeletons.<br1>
You must find me *corpse pieces*.<br1>
Of course there are many corpses inthe graveyard, but if you are caught disturbing the graves and pullingout coffins, you will be considered a witch and be burnt at the stake.<br1>
So there is no choice but to take the living corpses of the undead.<br1>
Whydo I need corpse pieces? Don't try to know the reason.<br1>
Haven't you heardthat curiosity killed the cat? All you have to do is find what I needand take the money.<br1>
