Collect corpse pieces from the *Ruins of Despair* or the *Ruinsof Agony.<br1>
* If you don't know how to find the ruins, ask Guard Curtis orGuard Babenco.<br1>
From the *zombies*, bring their *head, heart, and liver*.<br1>
From the *skeletons*, bring the *skull, spine, rib, arm bone, and thighbone*.<br1>
I also need bone pieces, but actually I need a *completeskeleton* of Human form more.<br1>
Unfortunately, when you fight with theundead, their body shatters so it will be impossible to find a completeskeleton.<br1>
But the person that took this job before you found onesomehow.<br1>
Ah, and don't bring back anything from the spartoi.<br1>
Spartoi are'his' minions.<br1>
It is better not to make him angry.<br1>
