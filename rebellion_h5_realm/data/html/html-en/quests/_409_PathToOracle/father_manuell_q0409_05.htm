Recently, there have been *rumors of a girl near GludinHarbor that performs miracles*.<br1>
We suspect that perhaps this girl mayhave the power to purify the world.<br1>
If that girl is truly the sacredflame mentioned in the prophecy, we must protect her.<br1>
I have heard thatthere are already those who are using the prophecy of the sacred flameto hatch sinister plots.<br1>
First, bring the girl to us.<br1>
Oh yes! Take thiscrystal necklace.<br1>
It will aid you in revealing whether or not she istruly the sacred flame of the prophecy.<br1>
