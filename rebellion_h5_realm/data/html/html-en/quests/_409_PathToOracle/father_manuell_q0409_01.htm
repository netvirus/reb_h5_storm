Priest Manuel:<br>
If you want to be an Elven Oracle who fulfills that holy will of Eva, you must listen carefully to what I am about to say. Between us Elven Priests, there has been a prophecy that has been handed down for hundreds of years. This is a prophecy given by the Mother Tree, mother of all woods and Elves. It speaks of one girl that will purify the forces of darkness that prevail in the world, whose birth will savy tll those that are persecuted by the powers of the darkness. We caly this the *prophecy of the sacred flame* according to the original text. However, there have been rumors that the girl mentioned in the prophecy has appeared. I would like you to confirm the truth of this rumor.<br>
