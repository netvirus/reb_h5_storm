If you want to be an Elven Oracle who fulfills that holywill of Eva, you must listen carefully to what I am about to say.<br1>
Between us Elven Priests, there has been a prophecy that has been handeddown for hundreds of years.<br1>
This is a prophecy given by the Mother Tree,mother of all woods and Elves.<br1>
It speaks of one girl that will purifythe forces of darkness that prevail in the world, whose birth will saveall those that are persecuted by the powers of the darkness.<br1>
We callthis the *prophecy of the sacred flame* according to the original text.<br1>
However, there have been rumors that the girl mentioned in the prophecyhas appeared.<br1>
I would like you to confirm the truth of this rumor.<br1>
