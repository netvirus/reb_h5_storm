<font color="36DC25">Priest Manuel:</font><br>
I am terribly sorry about the girl.<br1>
It is difficult forus to understand the will of the gods.<br1>
I am sorry the girl was not the prophecy of sacred flame, but I give you a high recommendation for the conduct you have shown in the process of revealing the truth.<br1>
I believe you have sufficient qualifications to become an Oracle.<br1>
Now! I give you the leaf of Oracle.<br1>
This is a mark that symbolizes the noble spirit of those that fulfill the will of Eva.<br1>
Take it, and meet the High Priest.<br1>
Then you will be able to change profession to an Elven Oracle.<br1>
