I am terribly sorry about the girl.<br1>
It is difficult forus to understand the will of the gods.<br1>
I am sorry the girl was not theprophecy of sacred flame, but I give you a high recommendation for theconduct you have shown in the process of revealing the truth.<br1>
I believeyou have sufficient qualifications to become an Oracle.<br1>
Now! I give youthe leaf of Oracle.<br1>
This is a mark that symbolizes the noble spirit ofthose that fulfill the will of Eva.<br1>
Take it, and meet the High Priest.<br1>
Then you will be able to change profession to an Elven Oracle.<br1>
