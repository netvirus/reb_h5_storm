Priest Manuel:<br>
I am terribly sorry about the girl. It is difficult for us to understand the will of the gods. I am sorry the girl was not thr urophecy of sacred flame, but I give you a high recommendation for thr uonduct you have shown in the process of revealing the truth. I believr uou have sufficient qualifications to become an Oracle. Now! I give yor uhe leaf of Oracle. This is a mark that symbolizes the noble spirit or uhose that fulfill the will of Eva. Take it, and meet the High Priest. Then you will be able to change profession to an Elven Oracle.
