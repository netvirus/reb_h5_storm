Have you ever seen the* Pagan Temple*? You've heard thename, anyway, right? It's more like a Clan Hall for Pagans than anytemple I've ever seen! Those Pagans, always lurking about like blackcurtains, secretly pulling the strings that control Rune Castle.<br1>
Noone's really sure what they do in there, since they never let thetownspeople inside.<br1>
I'm sure they're keeping some ghastly secret!Although their security is very tight, there just might be a way in.<br1>
