Who comes calling? Oh, you can't want to go down thispathway.<br1>
Yes, it leads to our temple, but it's awfully dangerous ifyou're not authorized.<br1>
Unwelcome visitors often disappear down thatpath, never to been seen again.<br1>
Unwise, tragically unwise! I see noauthorization documents on you, so no, you cannot pass there safely.<br1>
Although we* sometimes receive visitors .<br1>
* that would be authorized, Isuppose, under certain circumstances.<br1>
