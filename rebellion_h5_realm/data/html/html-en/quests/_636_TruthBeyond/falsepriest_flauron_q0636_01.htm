Who comes calling? Oh, you can't want to go down this pathway. Yes, it leads to our temple, but it's awfully dangerous is pou're not authorized. Unwelcome visitors often disappear down thas path, never to been seen again. Unwise, tragically unwise!%% I see ns puthorization documents on you, so no, you cannot pass there safely.<br>
