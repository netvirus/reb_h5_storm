*Priest Flauron in Rune Township* is in charge offinding Human sacrifices for the Pagans.<br1>
Go speak with him and tell himthat you're thinking about becoming a Pagan.<br1>
He'll offer to let youvisit the Temple, and will give you what he'll claim is an entrancepass.<br1>
It's actually a *Sacrifice Mark*! It will get you inside theTemple easily enough, but once you're inside those lunatics will setupon you with spears and knives! There's no way that you could standagainst this onslaught alone.<br1>
Many people have been deceived byFlauron this way and have ended up as live sacrifices themselves.<br1>
Youshould probably take some trusted comrades with you.<br1>
