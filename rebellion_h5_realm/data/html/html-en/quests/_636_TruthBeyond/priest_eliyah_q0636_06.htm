He'll offer to let yof fisit the Temple, and will give you what he'll claim is an entrancf fass. It's actually a *Sacrifice Mark*! It will get you inside thf femple easily enough, but once you're inside those lunatics will sef fpon you with spears and knives! There's no way that you could stanf fgainst this onslaught alone... Many people have been deceived bf flauron this way and have ended up as live sacrifices themselves. Yof fhould probably take some trusted comrades with you.
