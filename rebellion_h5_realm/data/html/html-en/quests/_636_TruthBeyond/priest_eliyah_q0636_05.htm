Very well then! Well, I'll get started.<br1>
Please payattention! I don't want to have to repeat myself! *Priest Flauron inRune Township* is in charge of finding Human sacrifices for them.<br1>
Gospeak with him and tell him that you're thinking about becoming aPagan.<br1>
He'll offer to let you visit the Temple, and will give you whathe'll claim is an entrance pass.<br1>
It's actually a *Sacrifice Mark*! Itwill get you inside the Temple easily enough, but once you're insidethose lunatics will set upon you at once with spears and knives! There'sno way that you could stand against this onslaught alone.<br1>
Manypeople have been decieved by Flauron and ended up as live sacrifices.<br1>
You should probably take some trusted comrades with you, but I heardthat the Pagans have a strange technique for scattering the forces ofoutsiders.<br1>
