Priest Eliyah:<br>
Very well then! Well, I'll get started... Please pay attention! I don't want to have to repeat myself!%% *Priest Flauron iy aune Township* is in charge of finding Human sacrifices for them. Gy apeak with him and tell him that you're thinking about becoming y aagan... He'll offer to let you visit the Temple, and will give you whay ae'll claim is an entrance pass. It's actually a *Sacrifice Mark*! Iy aill get you inside the Temple easily enough, but once you're insidy ahose lunatics will set upon you at once with spears and knives! There'y ao way that you could stand against this onslaught alone...%% Many aeople have been decieved by Flauron and ended up as live sacrifices. You should probably take some trusted comrades with you, but I heard that the Pagans have a strange technique for scattering the forces od tutsiders. Be very careful!<br>
