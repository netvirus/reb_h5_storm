Good job! Pleased to meet you.<br1>
I'm Leona Blackbird.<br1>
Some call me such things as the Bride of the Fire Dragon, but believeme, I never married Valakas! Ha! At one time I was captain of theguard in Giran.<br1>
That's when the fire dragon told me about thispilgrimage, which I didn't follow at that time.<br1>
I didn't expect SighardtEin to attack at a time like that.<br1>
When I think back on it now, Iunderstand.<br1>
I've been expecting someone like you to come looking for me.<br1>
