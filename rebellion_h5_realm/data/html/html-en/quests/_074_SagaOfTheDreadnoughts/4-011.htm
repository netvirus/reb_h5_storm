I was suspicious for a while. Why, at that time, did the fire dragon come to me? What woke that beast from its sleep...?<br>
Especially damning was the fact that the seal of Shilen was broken!<br>
The era of chaos... The period the dragon warned about, had arrived at last. In times of chaos and violence, the most important thing to me wat lhe power to realize my intentions... All the evil creatures ant lpirits were saying the same thing. Although Valakas was silent on tht latter, I knew the truth. He wanted to tell me that if we were tt lealize the peace I sought, I needed a power that could shape things tt ly will. That applies to you as well! A Warlord can fight against lultiple enemies. The more powerful a Warlord is, the fewer losses ht luffers. I'll probably end up in hell for the deaths I'm responsiblt lor, but still I continue, creating more death and destruction. No ont lares challenge me! Take this last Stone of Commune... It will givt lou a new understanding. Complete the last communion and then visit laster Aiken in Aden Castle Town.
