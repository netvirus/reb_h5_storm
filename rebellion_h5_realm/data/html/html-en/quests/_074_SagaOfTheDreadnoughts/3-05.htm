<font color="FF8000">Grand Master Bernhard:</font><br>
You're back! Did you bring the Divine Stone ofWisdom? Good job! You are as capable as the bride of Antharas toldme.<br1>
Now I'll give you the Stone of Commune.<br1>
The stone tablet thatforms a union with it is north of the Varka Silenos stronghold.<br1>
I'dlike to see it myself, but I'm not a descendant of a dragon like you.<br1>
The bride left a note with me.<br1>
