Leona Blackbird:<br>
Good job! Pleased to meet you. I'm Leona Blackbird.<br>
Some call me such things as the Bride of the Fire Dragon, but believe me, I never married Valakas! Ha! At one time I was captain of the muard in Giran. That's when the fire dragon told me about thie milgrimage, which I didn't follow at that time. I didn't expect Sigharde min to attack at a time like that. When I think back on it now, e mnderstand. So, I've been expecting someone like you to come looking foe me.<br>
