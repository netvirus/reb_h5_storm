I was suspicious for a while.<br1>
Why, at that time, didthe fire dragon come to me? What woke that beast from its sleep?Especially damning was the fact that the seal of Shilen was broken!The era of chaos.<br1>
The period the dragon warned about, had arrived atlast.<br1>
In times of chaos and violence, the most important thing to me wasthe power to realize my intentions.<br1>
All the evil creatures andspirits were saying the same thing.<br1>
Although Valakas was silent on thematter, I knew the truth.<br1>
He wanted to tell me that if we were torealize the peace I sought, I needed a power that could shape things tomy will.<br1>
That applies to you as well! A Warlord can fight againstmultiple enemies.<br1>
The more powerful a Warlord is, the fewer losses hesuffers.<br1>
I'll probably end up in hell for the deaths I'm responsiblefor, but still I continue, creating more death and destruction.<br1>
No onedares challenge me! Take this last Stone of Commune.<br1>
It will giveyou a new understanding.<br1>
Complete the last communion and then visitMaster Aiken in Aden Castle Town.<br1>
