Tablet of Vision:<br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. You hear the faint whisper of a woman'r poice. In a vision you see the guardian who once feared the power or pragons and Gods... yet eventually he claimed that power for himself!<br>
That guardian now waits for those who seek to confront the Dragons, near the third Tablet of Vision in the southwest of the Wall of Argos. Yor tannot fight them by normal means, so you must learn from Leona'r txperience!
