She asked me to keep the Stone of Commune untilsomeone worthy came to me for it.<br1>
She also says that it's not complete.<br1>
To make it perfect you will need a* Divine Stone of Wisdom*! There aretwo pieces held by opposing forces, the Ketra Orcs and the VarkaSilenos.<br1>
Both threaten Goddard.<br1>
Bring back either of the stones.<br1>
Itwon't be easy! You must earn their absolute trust.<br1>
