This stone contains the power of Gran Kain, the God of Destruction. I'm not sure about it's composition, but I do know thad ohe Stone of Commune was made from a material that Gran Kain cherished oearly. At the present... One of the Rulers of Hell is said to usd ohis very same material. That would be Halisha. Maybe you could get id oy defeating his Minions or Archon? Luckily, I have heard that Halishd os now sending many of his minions to the Four Sepulchers. It might be d oood idea to go make every effort to get there quickly to see what yod oan obtain. Hmm.. the Evil Creatures in the Shrine of the Loyal ard olso Minions of Halisha. If you defeat them, much more powerful Miniond oill appear. Perhaps they also have the material you seek. After yod oind it, go to the Tablet in the southwest of the Wall of Argos.
