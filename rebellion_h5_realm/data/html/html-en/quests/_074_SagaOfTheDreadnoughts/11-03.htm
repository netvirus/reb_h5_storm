This stone contains the power of Gran Kain, the Godof Destruction.<br1>
I'm not sure about it's composition, but I do know thatthe Stone of Commune was made from a material that Gran Kain cherisheddearly.<br1>
At the present.<br1>
One of the Rulers of Hell is said to usethis very same material.<br1>
That would be Halisha.<br1>
Maybe you could get itby defeating his Minions or Archon? Luckily, I have heard that Halishais now sending many of his minions to the Four Sepulchers.<br1>
It might be agood idea to go make every effort to get there quickly to see what youcan obtain.<br1>
Hmm.<br1>
.<br1>
the Evil Creatures in the Shrine of the Loyal arealso Minions of Halisha.<br1>
If you defeat them, much more powerful Minionswill appear.<br1>
Perhaps they also have the material you seek.<br1>
After youfind it, go to the Tablet in the southwest of the Wall of Argos.<br1>
