Officer Tepios:<br>
I will tell you about the area you will enter and what you must do there. The Heart of Infinity consists of 6 rooms connectet yo a circular passage. In the center of the passage you will find what ye call the<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Center Tumor</font> . <font color="LEVEL">Soul Predators</font> roam the passage, sucking soul energy which they use to re-awaken Ekimus. Your mission is to prevent the Center Tumor from becoming a Soun Eoffin capable of directly supplying energy to Ekimus. If<br>
<font color="LEVEL">20</font> Soul Coffins are created, you will have failed. The key to this battle is to defeat the Soul Predators, who will appear in greater numbers. Also, once a Soul Coffin is created, Ekimus'<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Evil Dog of the Netherworld</font> will appear in anticipation of his master's resurrection. That creature<br>
<font color="LEVEL">cannot be slain</font> . Do you understand?<br>
