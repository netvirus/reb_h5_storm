Up until very recently, we had managed to stabilize andcontrol each area by occupying the<font color="LEVEL">Seed of Infinity</font>.<br1>
But now the power of Ekimus is again growing strong, and the undeadhave again awakened and re-occupied both areas.<br1>
We think Ekimus will beagain reach full strength very soon.<br1>
The<font color="LEVEL">Predators of Soul</font>are directly supplying him with energy.<br1>
Unless they are stopped, theentire Seed will fall into the possession of the undead.<br1>
We needvolunteers to help<font color="LEVEL">defend the Heart of Infinity</font>.<br1>
