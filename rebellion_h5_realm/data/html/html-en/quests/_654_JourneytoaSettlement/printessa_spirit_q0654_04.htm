Well.<br1>
I need a *parchment to write the spell on*.<br1>
Goto the *Wall of Argos* and slaughter the *Canyon Antelope* or the*Canyon Antelope Slave* and bring me the *Skin of the Antelope*! It'llmake a lovely parchment! Ah! By the way, *once you pass through theforce field, only the Command Channel Leader in command of all theparties needs the scroll*.<br1>
Therefore, only one skin is needed.<br1>
