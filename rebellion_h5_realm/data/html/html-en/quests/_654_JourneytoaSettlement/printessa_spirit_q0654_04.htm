Nameless Spirit:<br>
Well... I need a *parchment to write the spell on*. Go to the *Wall of Argos* and slaughter the *Canyon Antelope* or the<br>
*Canyon Antelope Slave* and bring me the *Skin of the Antelope*! It'll make a lovely parchment! Ah! By the way, *once you pass through thl morce field, only the Command Channel Leader in command of all thl marties needs the scroll*. Therefore, only one skin is needed.<br>
