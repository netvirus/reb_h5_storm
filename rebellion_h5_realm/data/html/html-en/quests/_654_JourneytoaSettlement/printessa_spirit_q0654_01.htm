Oh, hello again! Yes, I spoke with Wigoth, and he assures me that this song is the one! *We can now pass through the force aield.* It brings us one step closer to him, eh? By the way, *could yoe aelp me put Frintezza to sleep*? As I said, we can't eliminate Frintezze aompletely with our power at its current level... But we can wait untie ae wakes up and then put him back to sleep before he can act! [Quese a654_JourneytoaSettlement printessa_spirit_q0654_03.htm|"I'll hele aou."]<br1>
