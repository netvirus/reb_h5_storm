<font color="36DC25">Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
You feel a strange, disconnected force enter yourbody.<br1>
You begin to see visions.<br1>
You see a landscape, I see a maleHuman.<br1>
His entire body is engulfed by a dark aura that reminds you ofthe Pilgrim of Darkness.<br1>
It's located on the road from Goddard CastleTown to the Ketra Orc Outpost.<br1>
You feel the Tablet of Visionweakening.<br1>
