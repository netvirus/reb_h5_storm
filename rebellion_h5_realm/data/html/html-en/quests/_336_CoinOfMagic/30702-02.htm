This coin is an object that a longtime ago, mystics instilled magic into it so that the coin would shinein each mystic's unique color.<br1>
These coins were crafted by the highestskilled dwarven artisans at the time.<br1>
High level magic power wasbestowed upon these coins to turn them into great works of art.<br1>
According to legend, mystics used these coins as their own marks.<br1>
Aperson who helped a mystic would be given a coin as a mark of gratitudeand to the one who became an enemy to a mystic, a coin was given as themark of a curse.<br1>
Actually I heard that one of my ancestors did a favorfor a mystic and received this coin.<br1>
Later on, there was a time whenmystics were misunderstood by people as demons and many of them werekilled.<br1>
The coins confiscated at that time were considered objects withthe mystics' curses upon them and many of them were thrown out near theplaces where they were executed.<br1>
Nowadays, these coins have become merecollectible items of ignorant people such as Sorint.<br1>
