Do you think I am acquainted with suchan ignorant person? Birds of a feather flock together.<br1>
Anyway, one of myancestors received this coin from someone named Kaldis.<br1>
I heard thatKaldis was hiding out in the Forest of Mirrors during the time whenmystics were being persecuted.<br1>
However, he ended up being killed bylizardmen who inhabited the forest.<br1>
If you go to this area and lookfor them perhaps you may stumble onto coins that are similar to thisone.<br1>
