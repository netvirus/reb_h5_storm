<font color="36DC25">Guard Stan:</font><br>
I had my own reason to apply for the guard position.<br1>
WhileI stand here on my guard duty, I have the chance to meet with peoplefrom all over the world, and this gives me the opportunity to collectrare coins.<br1>
Heh heh heh.<br1>
By the way, what would you like to trade with?These are all the coins I have.<br1>
Also if you would like to trade withme, you will need *Blood Werewolf, Blood Drevanul, Gold knight, GoldDrake, Silver Golem or Silver Fairy*.<br1>
Make your choice from what I have.<br1>
