Lately, I have been feeling weak anddepressed.<br1>
I have found an object I really would like to possess nomatter what.<br1>
But there is this fool who is insisting that it is a familyheirloom without knowing its true value.<br1>
Just because of a stupid manlike that I cannot get a hold of this treasure.<br1>
I feel veryfrustrated! If I ask someone who is more tactful than myself, perhaps,the person will obtain the item and bring it back to me.<br1>
