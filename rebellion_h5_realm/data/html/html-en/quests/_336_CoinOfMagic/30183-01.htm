<font color="FF8000">Warehouse Keeper Hagger:</font><br>
To tell you about myself, I can say that I wasone of the initial members of the coin collecting club.<br1>
Other folks madefun of me for gathering various things, but I was simply collectingcoins.<br1>
However.<br1>
Due to a number of different reasons, I'm still atlevel 3.<br1>
OK, OK.<br1>
Take a look at the coin list that I boast of.<br1>
Ifthere's something you'd like to exchange, please bring me *SilverUnicorn, Gold Wyvern or Blood Medusa coins*.<br1>
