You are a young man that I can count on! Myfirst impressions about you was correct! Now then, I will go ahead andexplain the details.<br1>
You know Bernard, the president of the HuntersGuild in this town? He is showing off a coin that he claims to be a Coinof Luck.<br1>
Actually the coin is called *"kaldis gold dragon"*among us coincollectors.<br1>
It is a very rare coin! Isn't it a shame that such a rareobject is owned by a fool who does not understand its true value! So, Imade an offer to Bernard.<br1>
I would pay him a high price for giving it tome.<br1>
But he stubbornly refused to hand over the coin to me.<br1>
I wouldappreciate it if you could persuade him with some convincing words andbring back the coin to me.<br1>
