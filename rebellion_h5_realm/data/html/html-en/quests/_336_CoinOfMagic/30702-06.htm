<font color="36DC25">Bernard, Hunter Union President:</font><br>
To be honest with you.<br1>
after youcame to visit me, I was intrigued by what you said and did someresearch.<br1>
By getting help from my union members, I found out the areaswhere the coins are discovered often.<br1>
Let me see.<br1>
What I have foundout so far is that.<br1>
*Lakin* and *vanor silenos* in the southern partof Aden, and * timak orcs* of northern Oren are in possession of thesecoins.<br1>
Also, *Bandits' Stronghold in Oren, the Cemetery of Kings in Adenand Dragon Valley * are the places where the coins are often discovered.<br1>
