I make various tools and artistic items while doingmy blacksmith work but I haven't seen anything as beautiful as thiscoin.<br1>
This seems to have the power of magic in addition to the humantouch.<br1>
But what do you want to exchange? You've nothing but this coin.<br1>
And to exchange it with me*, you'll still need gold drakes, goldknights, blood drevanuls, blood werewolves, silver golems and silverfairies.<br1>
