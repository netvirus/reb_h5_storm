One of my ancestors received this coinfrom someone named Kaldis.<br1>
I heard that Kaldis was hiding out in theForest of Mirrors during the time when mystics were being persecuted.<br1>
However, he ended up being killed by lizardmen who inhabited theforest.<br1>
If you go to this area and look for them perhaps you maystumble onto coins that are similar to this one.<br1>
