Hello there! An important person has comeback! Since Grade 1 members have the privilege of dealing with many rarecoins, many members are desiring to become Grade 1.<br1>
However, the numberof Grade 1 members is limited.<br1>
To put it simply, I'm saying that Grade 1membership is not given to just anybody who asks for it.<br1>
Therefore, youshould be extra careful in your words and deeds.<br1>
