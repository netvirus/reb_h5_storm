I have been collecting coins like this for a whilebut I'm not sure whether it was the right thing to get into.<br1>
I heardthat quite a few people and their families became destitute aftergetting sucked into this collecting business.<br1>
However, the more you lookat coins the more you get absorbed by them.<br1>
People say that whenever Iexchange coins, it seems like my personality changes.<br1>
Anyway, what didyou say you wanted to trade with? These are all the coins I have.<br1>
Imainly trade with the *Gold Wyvern, Silver Unicorn and Blood Medusa*.<br1>
