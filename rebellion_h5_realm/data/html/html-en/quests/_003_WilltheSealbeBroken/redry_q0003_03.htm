Tetrarch Talloth:<br>
The materials that I require for my magic are the *onyx beast's eye*, *taint stone* and *succubus' blood*.<br1>
You can find all three materials at the abandoned *School of Dark Arts*.<br1>
If you do not know the way, ask Sentry Kayleen.<br1>
You can obtain the first component by killing the *onyx beast* and taking the jewel that is embedded in its eye.<br1>
The second material can be gathered by hunting *stink zombies* or *tainted zombies*, the undead that wander the School of Dark Arts.<br1>
The final material can be obtained only by killing the *succubus*, who resides in the deepest lairs of the School of Dark Arts.<br1>
It may be safer for you to train a bit more before you leave, because zombies and the succubus may be difficult for you to hunt.<br1>
There is no need to hurry.<br1>
Gather the materials diligently, and bring them to me when you have gathered all three.<br1>
May the protection of Shilen be with you.
