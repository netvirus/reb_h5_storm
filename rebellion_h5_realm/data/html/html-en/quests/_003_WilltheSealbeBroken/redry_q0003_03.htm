The materials that I require for my magic are the*onyx beast's eye*, *taint stone* and *succubus' blood*.<br1>
You can findall three materials at the abandoned *School of Dark Arts*.<br1>
If you donot know the way, ask Sentry Kayleen.<br1>
You can obtain the first componentby killing the *onyx beast* and taking the jewel that is embedded in itseye.<br1>
The second material can be gathered by hunting *stink zombies* or*tainted zombies*, the undead that wander the School of Dark Arts.<br1>
Thefinal material can be obtained only by killing the *succubus*, whoresides in the deepest lairs of the School of Dark Arts.<br1>
It may be saferfor you to train a bit more before you leave, because zombies and thesuccubus may be difficult for you to hunt.<br1>
There is no need to hurry.<br1>
Gather the materials diligently, and bring them to me when you havegathered all three.<br1>
May the protection of Shilen be with you.<br1>
