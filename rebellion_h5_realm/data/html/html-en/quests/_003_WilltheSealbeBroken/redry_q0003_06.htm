Tetrarch Talloth:<br>
You've found all three materials.<br1>
Well done! Now I can start my research to undo the 'spiritual chains.'<br1>
We need further observation to see if the research will yield any results, but I believe that the seals placed on our patriarch will one day be broken.<br1>
I will give you this as a token of my appreciation.<br1>
Think of it as a just payment for working for our race.<br1>
I am not alone in the research to break the seal.<br1>
*Sorceress Kayla* is continuing her research in the region known as *Giran*, to free the mental chains that bind the mind of  our patriarch If you ever pass through that region, I suggest that you go and seek her.<br1>
She may also need your help someday.<br1>
May the shelter of the abyss be with you, 'til the day our Dark Elf race rules the destiny of the land.
