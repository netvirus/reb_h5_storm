You've found all three materials.<br1>
Well done! Now Ican start my research to undo the 'spiritual chains.<br1>
' We need furtherobservation to see if the research will yield any results, but I believethat the seals placed on our patriarch will one day be broken.<br1>
I willgive you this as a token of my appreciation.<br1>
Think of it as a justpayment for working for our race.<br1>
I am not alone in the research tobreak the seal.<br1>
*Sorceress Kayla* is continuing her research in theregion known as *Giran*, to free the mental chains that bind the mind ofour patriarch If you ever pass through that region, I suggest that yougo and seek her.<br1>
She may also need your help someday.<br1>
May the shelter ofthe abyss be with you, 'til the day our Dark Elf race rules the destinyof the land.<br1>
