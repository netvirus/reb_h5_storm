Tetrarch Talloth:<br>
Tsk tsk. I will tell you one more time.<br1>
I need the *onyx beast's eye*, *taint stone* and *succubus' blood*.<br1>
You can obtain the first component by killing the onyx beast and taking the jewel that is embedded in its eye.<br1>
The second material can be gathered by hunting<br1>
stink zombies or tainted zombies, the undead that wander the School of Dark Arts.<br1>
The final material can be obtained only by killing the succubus, who resides in the deepest lairs of the School of Dark Arts.<br>
When you have gathered all three materials, bring them to me.
