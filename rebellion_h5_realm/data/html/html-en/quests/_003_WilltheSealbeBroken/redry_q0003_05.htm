Tsk tsk.<br1>
I will tell you one more time.<br1>
I need the*onyx beast's eye*, *taint stone* and *succubus' blood*.<br1>
You can obtainthe first component by killing the onyx beast and taking the jewel thatis embedded in its eye.<br1>
The second material can be gathered by huntingstink zombies or tainted zombies, the undead that wander the School ofDark Arts.<br1>
The final material can be obtained only by killing thesuccubus, who resides in the deepest lairs of the School of Dark Arts.<br1>
When you have gathered all three materials, bring them to me.<br1>
