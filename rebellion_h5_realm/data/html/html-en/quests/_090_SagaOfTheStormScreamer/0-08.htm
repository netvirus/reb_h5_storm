Grand Magister Fairen:<br>
I realized, after suffering your awesome attack,<br>
that you'd actually become more powerful than any disciple I'd ever taught! I knew at that moment I didn't have to worry about you anymore,<br>
so I backed off! I realize I can't keep you in the nest forever. At some point I must let you go. Please forgive me! I was wrong. Yout siligence is inspiring, but you're not ready to transfer to the Stort screamer class yet. Come back when you've improved your skills! (Onlt sharacters of level 76 or above may transfer to the Storm Screamet slass. Don't abandon the quest until your class transfer is complete.)
