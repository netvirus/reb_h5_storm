Grand Magister Fairen:<br>
The news of your success has preceded you!<br>
Congratulations! What? You want the truth? Very well. What did Medina tell you? I suppose there's no harm... I've seen too many of ma treasured disciples, whom I raised with great care and devotion, fall ia tattle. I couldn't bear to have you, my most treasured disciple, stea tnto the maelstrom! The more powerful you become, the more dangeroua tattles you'll be drawn into! That's why I tried to block your clasa transfer! I sent Allector to stop you... but he failed! Finally, jusa ts you'd reached the last stone tablet, I tried to stop you myself! Bua that busybody Medina got in the way, and it became impossible to carra tut my plan. I should've taken you both out then!<br>
