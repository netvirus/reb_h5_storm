The news of your success has preceded you!Congratulations! What? You want the truth? Very well.<br1>
What did Medinatell you? I suppose there's no harm.<br1>
I've seen too many of mytreasured disciples, whom I raised with great care and devotion, fall inbattle.<br1>
I couldn't bear to have you, my most treasured disciple, stepinto the maelstrom! The more powerful you become, the more dangerousbattles you'll be drawn into! That's why I tried to block your classtransfer! I sent Allector to stop you.<br1>
but he failed! Finally, justas you'd reached the last stone tablet, I tried to stop you myself! Butthat busybody Medina got in the way, and it became impossible to carryout my plan.<br1>
