Grand Magister Fairen:<br>
I realized, after suffering your awesome attack,<br>
that you'd actually become more powerful than any disciple I'd ever taught! I knew at that moment I didn't have to worry about you anymore,<br>
so I backed off! I realize I can't keep you in the nest forever. At some point I must let you go. Please forgive me! I was wrong. Yout siligence is inspiring. Congratulations! You're now a Storm Screamer!
