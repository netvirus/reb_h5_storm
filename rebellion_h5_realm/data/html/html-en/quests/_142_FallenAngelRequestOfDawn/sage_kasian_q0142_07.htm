<br> Justice begins by valuing individuals and their beliefs,	something the Temple will never condone in its quest to bring	everything under its heel.<br1>
<br> I stand against that kind of corrupt power-mongering in the	name of religion.<br1>
<br>Nothing you do to me will shake that belief!	<br>	<a		action="bypass -h Quest _142_FallenAngelRequestOfDawn sage_kasian_q0142_09.<br1>

I believe that I can bring peace and		order through my strong leadership.<br1>
