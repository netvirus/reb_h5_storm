<br> Ah, you are the one sent by Shadow Fox.<br1>
<br> Rumors have spread like wildfire about this matter.<br1>
From what	we have learned, this is a fallen angel who rebelled against Einhasad,	fleeing to this place after she was defeated.<br1>
<br> Not surprisingly, this fallen angel is spreading heresy about	Einhasad and our Temple.<br1>
<br> In obedience to Einhasad's wishes, we must punish this	dangerous creature before more innocents are led astray by her	blasphemy.<br1>
