<font color="36DC25"><html><body>	High Priest Raymond:</font><br>
<br> According to the coded message, Elder Casian, who supports	the	<font color="LEVEL">Revolutionaries of Dusk</font> against both our	association and the Lords of Dawn, is attempting to render assistance	to the wounded fallen angel.<br1>
That means he must know where the creature	can be found.<br1>
<br>	<br> Go find	<font color="LEVEL">Elder Casian</font>, rumored to be somewhere in the	wilderness.<br1>
Determine the location of the fallen angel, and rid us of	this troublesome, blasphemous creature.<br1>
<br> Bring me the	<font color="LEVEL">blood of the fallen angel</font> as proof of his	destruction.<br1>
<br> Guard yourself carefully in both mind and body -- although	wounded, this angel will nevertheless be a formidable adversary.<br1>
