<br> Go find	<font color="LEVEL">Elder Casian</font>, rumored to be somewhere in the	wilderness.<br1>
Determine the location of the fallen angel,	<br> and rid us of this troublesome, blasphemous creature.<br1>
<br> Bring me the	<font color="LEVEL">blood of the fallen angel</font> as proof of his	destruction.<br1>
<br> Guard yourself carefully in both mind and body -- although	wounded, this angel will nevertheless be a formidable adversary.<br1>
