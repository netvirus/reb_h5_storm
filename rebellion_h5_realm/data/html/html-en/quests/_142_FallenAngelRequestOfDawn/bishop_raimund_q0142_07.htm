<br> Well done! Well done indeed!	<br> You have served Einhasad well by forever silencing the	blasphemous tongue of this sad, fallen creature.<br1>
<br> That fallen angel -- no, devil is a better word -- might have	led many astray if he had not been stopped.<br1>
<br> You have done a great service for both our order and the	people of this land.<br1>
