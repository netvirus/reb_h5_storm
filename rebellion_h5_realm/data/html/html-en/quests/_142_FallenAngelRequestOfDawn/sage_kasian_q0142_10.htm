<br> A preacher carrying the	<font color="LEVEL">Sealed Prophecy - Path of the God</font> was	attacked in this wilderness by ants.<br1>
He is missing, and without him we	do not know how to determine the location of the angel.<br1>
<br> Perhaps you can recover some pieces of the prophecy from the	ants in the Ant Nest.<br1>
<br> Provided, of course, that the vicious, machine-like ants	leave you alone.<br1>
