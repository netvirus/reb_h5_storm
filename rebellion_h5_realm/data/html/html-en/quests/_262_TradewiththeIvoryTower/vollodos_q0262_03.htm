You must travel far from the village to find thefungus.<br1>
They grow in the deep southern region of the Dark Forest, andalso near the School of Dark Arts.<br1>
You can get the *spore sac* bykilling the fungus, but sometimes the spore sac explodes when the fungusis killed, so you will probably have to hunt many fungi.<br1>
Gather *ten*spore sacs and bring them back to me.<br1>
Your payment will be more thanfair, so do not worry.<br1>
