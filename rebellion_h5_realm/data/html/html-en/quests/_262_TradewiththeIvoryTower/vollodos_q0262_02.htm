I travel to *Oren's Ivory Tower* once or twice a year.<br1>
What kind of place is the Ivory Tower of Oren, you ask? It is theheadquarters of Mystics, as well as an educational institute, and aplace where Mystics gather.<br1>
You can get useful magic potions andmaterials from the Traders or Mystics of the Ivory Tower.<br1>
A few of theIvory Tower Mystics have asked me to bring them magic materials that canonly be found in our Dark Forest.<br1>
They pay handsomely for the materialsthat I bring them, and it occurred to me that this might be thebeginning of a good business.<br1>
So I plan to go into it a bit deeper.<br1>
During my last visit I noticed that there were many Mystics looking for*mushroom spores*.<br1>
These spores can only be obtained from the *greenfungus* or the *blood fungus* that appear in our Dark Forest.<br1>
The fungiare strange, mushroom-shaped life forms that have formed from thefermented spores carried over from the Sea of Spores.<br1>
It is dangerousfor a mere businessman like myself to face the fungi alone.<br1>
Which bringsme to my point.<br1>
Do you think you could go and get me some? I will payyou well for them.<br1>
