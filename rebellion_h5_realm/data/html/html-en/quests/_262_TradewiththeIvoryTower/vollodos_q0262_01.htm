I travel to *Oren's Ivory Tower* once or twice a year.<br1>
What kind of place is the Ivory Tower of Oren, you ask? It is theheadquarters of Mystics, as well as an educational institute, and aplace where Mystics gather.<br1>
You can get useful magic potions andmaterials from the Traders or Mystics of the Ivory Tower.<br1>
But during myrecent visit, some of them asked me to bring them magic materials thatcan only be found in our Dark Forest.<br1>
They said that they would payhandsomely for the items they need.<br1>
So I've recently started to sellgoods such as the wings of an imp or an arachne's web there.<br1>
I'm lookingto see if I can gather some more precious items for sale.<br1>
I will ask foryour help when the time comes.<br1>
I'm going to need more hands if I want togather large amounts of any item.<br1>
