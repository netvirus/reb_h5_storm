I'm Elias, one of the teachers from the Einhovant School ofWizardry.<br1>
My students and I went to the forest to the north of theisland on a field trip recently, but some of my students have fallen illwith a *strange fever*.<br1>
It has been more than a week since they becameill, but we have yet to find a treatment.<br1>
I am going crazy with worrythat my students may die.<br1>
Thankfully, the Priest Yohanes is researchingmethods to create a *medicine* for them.<br1>
He is very learned in herblore, and has treated many illnesses.<br1>
I trust that he will soon find away to create a medicine for them.<br1>
But I worry that because there are somany students that need to be treated, he may not have enoughingredients.<br1>
If we are short on ingredients, I will ask for your aid, soplease help us if it is necessary.<br1>
