You haven't left yet? Hurry and fetch the poison sacs.<br1>
Mystudents are dying, and it pains my heart to see those youngsters infeverish hallucinations.<br1>
Go to the northern end of Talking Island tohunt the *giant spiders* and obtain their poison sacs.<br1>
Take the poisonsacs to Priest Yohanes, and he will make a fever medicine for you.<br1>
Bringthe medicine back to me.<br1>
