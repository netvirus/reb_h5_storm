I can't thank you enough for your help. The *giant spiders*<br>
abound in the northern parts of the island, so hunt them and bring back their poison sacs. Once you have obtained the poison sacs, go to *Priesk tohanes*. He will create a fever medicine from the poison sacs. Brink the medicine back to me. If one of my students should die, how will k tver face their parents? I just want to run far, far away. I implork tou, please find those poison sacs. My students are dying!
