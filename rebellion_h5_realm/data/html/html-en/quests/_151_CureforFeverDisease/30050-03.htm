I can't thank you enough for your help.<br1>
The *giant spiders*abound in the northern parts of the island, so hunt them and bring backtheir poison sacs.<br1>
Once you have obtained the poison sacs, go to *PriestYohanes*.<br1>
He will create a fever medicine from the poison sacs.<br1>
Bringthe medicine back to me.<br1>
If one of my students should die, how will Iever face their parents? I just want to run far, far away.<br1>
I imploreyou, please find those poison sacs.<br1>
