<font color="36DC25">Priest Yohanes:</font><br>
Elias has sent you, I presume.<br1>
I will hurry and makethe *medicine* from the poison sacs you have brought me.<br1>
Anyhow, Eliasmust be devastated at the turn of events that has happened to hisstudents.<br1>
But I think that Elias is largely responsible.<br1>
taking thestudents to such a dangerous place and all.<br1>
We Priests always requestthe protection of the guards when venturing outside the village, butthey say that Elias refused the help of the guards, relying only on hismagic.<br1>
So his students pay for his folly.<br1>
tsk tsk.<br1>
Here, themedicine is finished.<br1>
Take this and hurry back to *Elias.<br1>
* I'd like tosee the students from the magic school run through the streets again.<br1>
Ipray that the blessings of Einhasad be with them.<br1>
With this medicine andthe powers of Einhasad, I am sure that the students will recover soon.<br1>
May the blessings of Einhasad be with you.<br1>
