Priest Yohanes:<br>
Elias has sent you, I presume. I will hurry and make the *medicine* from the poison sacs you have brought me. Anyhow, Eliae tust be devastated at the turn of events that has happened to hie ttudents. But I think that Elias is largely responsible... taking the ttudents to such a dangerous place and all. We Priests always requese the protection of the guards when venturing outside the village, bue they say that Elias refused the help of the guards, relying only on hie tagic. So his students pay for his folly... tsk tsk... Here, the tedicine is finished. Take this and hurry back to *Elias.* I'd like te tee the students from the magic school run through the streets again. e tray that the blessings of Einhasad be with them. With this medicine ane the powers of Einhasad, I am sure that the students will recover soon.<br>
May the blessings of Einhasad be with you.
