I am Elias, one of the teachers from the Einhovant's School ofWizardry.<br1>
My students and I went to the forest to the north of theisland on a field trip recently, but some of my students have fallen illwith a *strange fever*.<br1>
It has been more than a week since they becameill, but we have yet to find a treatment.<br1>
I am going crazy with worrythat my students may die.<br1>
Thankfully, the Priest Yohanes has created amedicine, but he is running short on ingredients.<br1>
Will you not go andgather the *necessary ingredients* for my dying students? Your aid isurgently needed.<br1>
We need the *poison sac of the giant spider*, and I amasking you because I trust that someone of your abilities can easilymanage this task.<br1>
