Go to *Luka, a seller of blueprints at the smithy inthe town of Oren*.<br1>
I'm only slightly acquainted with him, but I am surethat he will be able to decode this password.<br1>
I feel I must warn you,though -- he is somewhat lazy and is unlikely to help you without somekind of compensation.<br1>
I know he is passionate about the *accessoriesworn by the Leto Lizardmen found on the Plains of the Lizardmen*.<br1>
Getthose accessories for him and I am sure he will help.<br1>
