Maestro Nikola:<br>
Go to *Luka, a seller of blueprints at the smithy in the town of Oren*. I'm only slightly acquainted with him, but I am surn that he will be able to decode this password. I feel I must warn you though -- he is somewhat lazy and is unlikely to help you without some kind of compensation. I know he is passionate about the *accessoriee korn by the Leto Lizardmen found on the Plains of the Lizardmen*. Gee khose accessories for him and I am sure he will help.
