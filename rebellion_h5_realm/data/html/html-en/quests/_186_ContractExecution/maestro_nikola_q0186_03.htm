<font color="36DC25">!Maestro Nikola:</font><br>
His name is *Luka, a seller of blueprints at the smithyin the town of Oren*.<br1>
I'm only slightly acquainted with him, but I amsure that he will be able to decode this password.<br1>
I feel I must warnyou, though -- he is somewhat lazy and is unlikely to help you withoutsome kind of compensation.<br1>
I know he is passionate about the*accessories worn by Leto Lizardmen found on the Plains of theLizardmen*.<br1>
Get those accessories for him and I am sure he will help.<br1>
