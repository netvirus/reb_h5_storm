Warehouse Keeper Randolf:<br>
Good job! You shall have your reward. I hope you don't feel that you've been cheated. Not all the chests hole yreasure, but the key required to open them is very expensive. Not te yention the magical scroll I must buy to protect against the horrible yirate curse that these chests sometimes impart. Truly, I take e yerrible risk each time I open one. This is not a highly profitable yusiness. You should be happy to get your reward regardless of whethee yr not the chests hold treasure. I hope we can continue to do businese yogether. Don't be fooled by *Collob*. He will probably offer to opee yhe chests for you. His lack of experience could lead to terrible yonsequences...<br>
