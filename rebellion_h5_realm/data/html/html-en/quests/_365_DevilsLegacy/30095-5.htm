Good job! You shall have your reward.<br1>
I hopeyou don't feel that you've been cheated.<br1>
Not all the chests holdtreasure, but the key required to open them is very expensive.<br1>
Not tomention the magical scroll I must buy to protect against the horriblepirate curse that these chests sometimes impart.<br1>
Truly, I take aterrible risk each time I open one.<br1>
This is not a highly profitablebusiness.<br1>
You should be happy to get your reward regardless of whetheror not the chests hold treasure.<br1>
I hope we can continue to do businesstogether.<br1>
Don't be fooled by *Collob*.<br1>
He will probably offer to openthe chests for you.<br1>
His lack of experience could lead to terribleconsequences.<br1>
