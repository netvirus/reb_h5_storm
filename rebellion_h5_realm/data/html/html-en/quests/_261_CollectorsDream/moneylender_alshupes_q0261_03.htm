Currently, my main interest is in the large insects that Isaw while traveling in the Human land of Gludio.<br1>
As you would know ifyou studied history, when the Mystics of the Ivory Tower battled theDark Sorcerer Beleth, also called a devil by the Humans of old, thestrong magical energy which arose from their combat caused southernGludio to become a barren plain and produced abnormalities such as antsthe size of houses and spiders the size of buffalos.<br1>
In the last tenyears, those great spiders have spread even to these Elven Woods.<br1>
Thetame creatures that have become accustomed to the care of the spiritsand fairies of our woods are the perfect prey for those giganticpredators.<br1>
Isn't that interesting? There are three kinds of giantspiders: crimson spiders, hook spiders, and pincer spiders.<br1>
I don't havea preference, but I want to put into my hands a *giant spider trophy*.<br1>
What you must do for me is to hunt the great spiders in the forest, cutoff *eight legs*, and bring them back to me.<br1>
It is a bit dangerous, butI will reward you generously for your efforts.<br1>
Giant spiders are oftenfound *near the Underground Fortress* or in the *Neutral Zone*.<br1>
