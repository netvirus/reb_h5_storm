Lately I've put aside the money lending business and havetaken up the hobby of collecting the skins or claws of rare animals.<br1>
There are many that criticize my hobby, saying that only Humans wouldgather the bodies of dead animals as trophies, but these are the samepeople that turn around and come to see or borrow them for a few days,saying that they need them for magic research -- of course, asking me tokeep it a secret from everyone else.<br1>
So how about it, will you take on ajob for me? It involves searching the fields and hunting rare animalsfor trophies.<br1>
I can't say it's an easy task, but I will compensate yougenerously for your labor.<br1>
