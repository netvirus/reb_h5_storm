Lately I've put aside the money lending business and havetaken up the hobby of collecting the skins or claws of rare animals.<br1>
There are many that criticize my hobby, saying that only Humans wouldgather the bodies of dead animals as trophies, but these are the samepeople that turn around and come to see or borrow them for a few days,saying that they need them for magic research -- of course, asking me tokeep it a secret from everyone else.<br1>
One day, when you become skilledenough to hunt rare animals, stop by and see me.<br1>
I will give you arewarding task to complete.<br1>
Right now, though, I think it would be fartoo difficult for you.<br1>
