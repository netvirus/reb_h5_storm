<font color="36DC25">!Defender Nathan:</font><br>
I heard about you from Mion.<br1>
You're helping hercollect the spider silks, right? I once learned the craft of spinningfrom the Golden Wheel Guild.<br1>
But I gave up being a craftsman, and becamea defender instead .<br1>
Actually, I once got my fortune told at the MaphrTemple.<br1>
They said I wouldn't live long if I became a craftsman .<br1>
Tsk.<br1>
Anyway, my skills don't compare to a master's, but the village girlsonce swooned at my spinning skills! So, if you have any tarantulaspinnerets, bring them to me.<br1>
