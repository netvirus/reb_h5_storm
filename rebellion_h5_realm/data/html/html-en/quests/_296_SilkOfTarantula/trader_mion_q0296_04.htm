Aghhh! What are you doing here? Hey .<br1>
I don't have time.<br1>
Just spin the silk out of them.<br1>
If I don't have twenty dresses bynext week, I will be kicked out of the Silver Scale Guild! I am tellingyou once more.<br1>
You may receive spider silks only by hunting *crimsontarantulas*, *hunter tarantulas* or *plunder tarantulas*.<br1>
Just find themquickly and I will pay you back for sure.<br1>
Also, you may only spin silksby giving *Defender Nathan* the* tarantula spinnerets*! You don't havemuch time! You should be busy hunting spiders now .<br1>
you shouldn'twaste your time like this! Please hurry, hurry .<br1>
I'm about to cry.<br1>
