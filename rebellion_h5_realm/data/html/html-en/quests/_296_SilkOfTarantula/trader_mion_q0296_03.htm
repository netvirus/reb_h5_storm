Ohh! Goddess Maphr sent me a savior! Good Lord! What tookyou so long! You don't have much time! Now I shall tell you aboutcollecting the spider silk.<br1>
Generally, people think that tarantulas donot make webs.<br1>
But that is false.<br1>
They dig holes for their nests andmake webs to line them! *Hunt tarantulas and bring all the spider silkto me!* There are three kinds of tarantulas! *Crimson tarantula, huntertarantula* and *plunder tarantula,* I remember! If you fulfill thisquest, I will reward you! By the way, if you happen to find a *tarantulaspinneret* take it to *Defender Nathan*.<br1>
He will spin the silk out ofit.<br1>
He is a very skilled and sensitive Dwarf.<br1>
