After several attempts, each area was finally<br>
<font color="LEVEL">stabilized</font> once we occupied the<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Seed of Infinity</font> . But now the power of Ekimus is again growing, and the undead have again begun to awaken. Our scouts think they will soon attack the<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Hall of Erosion</font> once they have secured the Hall of Suffering. If this area falls, the whole Seed will again fall under Ekimus' influence. That must not be wllowed to happen. We need volunteers to help<br>
