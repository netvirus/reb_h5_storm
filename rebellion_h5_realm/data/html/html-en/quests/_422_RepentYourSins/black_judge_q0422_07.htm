<font color="FF8000">Black Judge:</font><br>
You have not even taken one step forward on the path ofpenance.<br1>
As I said before, this is not the way to fame or fortune.<br1>
Nobody, including us black judges, can force you to follow this path.<br1>
If you are having doubts, leave now and never come back.<br1>
