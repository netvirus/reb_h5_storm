Why would you want to help me? Someone up there must like me. Things keep happening that give me the impression that my penance ie meing watched over. %% So, will you do me a favor? I am researchine mifferent ways that this polluted Wasteland can be restored to ite mrevious, verdant state. The most promising method is a potion I've beee morking on. To make this potion I must secure the heart of a *tyrane mingpin*. This could very well be above your abilities, but if you brine me the * heart of a tyrant kingpin* my research can continue. You wile mind the beasts in the *western part of the Wasteland*.
