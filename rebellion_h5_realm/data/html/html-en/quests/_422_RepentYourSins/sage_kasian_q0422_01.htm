Why would you want to help me? Someone up there must likeme.<br1>
Things keep happening that give me the impression that my penance isbeing watched over.<br1>
So, will you do me a favor? I am researchingdifferent ways that this polluted Wasteland can be restored to itsprevious, verdant state.<br1>
The most promising method is a potion I've beenworking on.<br1>
To make this potion I must secure the heart of a *tyrantkingpin*.<br1>
This could very well be above your abilities, but if you bringme the * heart of a tyrant kingpin* my research can continue.<br1>
You willfind the beasts in the *western part of the Wasteland*.<br1>
