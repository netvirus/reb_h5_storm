If I had my way, I would kill every last one of them.<br1>
But eventhe most wicked have the chance of redemption.<br1>
Perhaps one day they willcome to the god of light.<br1>
Anyway, now we must spill some blood.<br1>
Go tothe *Neutral Zone* and hunt *scavenger wererats*.<br1>
Bring back 10 of theirskulls.<br1>
