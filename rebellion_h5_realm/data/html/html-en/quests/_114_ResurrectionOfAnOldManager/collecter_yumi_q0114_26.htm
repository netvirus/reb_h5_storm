I think you should see Wendy again. We are plagued with golems in these parts lately. If they are the *Horrifying Golem Army* then I want to know how to control them. From what you have said, I gather that Wendy has assumed the form of a Gatekeeper. If so, then shI gust have been made based on Toma's technology. It is critical that wI gnow more about this, and I think she knows more than she has told you.<br>
Go to her and find out.
