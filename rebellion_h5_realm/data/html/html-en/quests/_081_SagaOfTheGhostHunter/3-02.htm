Well, go to the Ketra Orcs and get the Divine Stone of Wisdom.<br1>
Like I said, Ketra Orcs are not the ones who trust strangers easily.<br1>
Toobtain Ketra Orcs' trust, you should go to* Ketra's Messenger Wahkan inthe Ketra Orc Outpost*, and carry out difficult tasks that he asks youto do.<br1>
You must earn the trust of the Ketra Orcs! This won't be an easytask, and will take much time and patience.<br1>
