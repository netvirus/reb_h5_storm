At one time, I was considered the most likely to succeed inthe Hunters Union! Unfortunately, I made the mistake of challenging thepower that was forbidden by the gods! This power allows whoever controlsit to transcend Human limitations! But look where it got me! My bodywas totally ruined, and when I could no longer challenge the power, Iwas expelled from the union by my jealous rivals! I sank into a massof self-pity and regret! But then, I had an idea! Maybe I can't do itpersonally, but I can certainly train and send someone on my behalf!Using my brain rather than physical force, and overcoming many politicalobstacles, I took control of the union! While in that position, I neverfound the competent person I needed.<br1>
When I resigned, I was promised bythe president of the union that I would be supplied with a competentperson! He seemed credible then, he wasn't so obsessed with his coinsat that point.<br1>
