Oh, wonderful! You survivied! Frankly, even thoughI often say that I want to move away, it's hard to leave the big city! Imust have adena to live in the territory right now! I was saving up alittle every day, but when I returned home one day, I found that mysister had disappeared! She left a note saying that she was going out inthe world to help me! I couldn't do much as her older brother, but I'veheard that her name is on a list of graduates from Talking Island.<br1>
Imust see her, if only to give her a sword! I hate to ask you this sosuddenly, but.<br1>
