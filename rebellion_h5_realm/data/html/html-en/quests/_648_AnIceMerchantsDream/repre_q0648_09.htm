It's dangerous outside, so please be careful! I'm tellingyou, most of the creatures living in the Frozen Labyrinth have a SilverIce Crystal in their bodies.<br1>
Bring me these crystals and you'll bewell-rewarded.<br1>
Black Ice Crystals are quite rare, but if you find oneand bring it back to me, you'll be rewarded even more! Oh, by the way.<br1>
If you ever get any Silver Hemocytes, don't throw them away.<br1>
