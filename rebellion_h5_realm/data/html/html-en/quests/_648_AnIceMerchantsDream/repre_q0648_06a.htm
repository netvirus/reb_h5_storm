You may get a Black Ice Crystal by processing a Silver IceCrystal using the tools on the shelf.<br1>
It won't be easy, as it is a jobusually done only by professional craftsmen.<br1>
If you succeed in creatingthe Black Ice Crystal, I'll pay you very well for it.<br1>
Be careful,however, because failure won't pay you a thing.<br1>
If you were to stayaround for a while we might could work out a deal.<br1>
