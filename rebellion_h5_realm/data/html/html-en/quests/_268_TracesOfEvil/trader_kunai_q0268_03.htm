On behalf of the Duda-Mara tribe, I thank you! There ismuch to do.<br1>
In order to discover the source of this curse, we requirea medium.<br1>
Once the Kasha Spider was our sacred symbol, and even thoughit has been corrupted by this fiend, it will still be suitable for ourpurposes.<br1>
Go to the *northern region of the Immortal Plateau*.<br1>
There youmust slay *Kasha Spiders, Kasha Fang Spiders and Kasha Blade Spiders*and bring me *30 Contaminated Kasha Spider Venom samples*.<br1>
With them, Iwill be able to determine the source of this evil.<br1>
Naturally, you willbe rewarded for your efforts.<br1>
