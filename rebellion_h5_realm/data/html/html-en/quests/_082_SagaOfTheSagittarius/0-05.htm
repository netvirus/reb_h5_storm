Sagittarius's bow, the symbol of ourguild, was stolen.<br1>
During the day, it's on display, but at night, Ikeep it close at hand.<br1>
I was delayed putting it in the safe for just aminute while counting my new coins.<br1>
This must be a conspiracy againstme.<br1>
Your reputation is growing, I would appreciate your help.<br1>
