Well, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to tell youthe story.<br1>
In the past, I made a Shaved Ice dessert for mygranddaughter, and she loved it very much, but the ingredients are quiterare! The rarest and most important of the ingredients are icecrystals.<br1>
The last time I got some, I had to trade Chef Jeremy someother very rare ingredients for them.<br1>
Can you please bring me some ofthose crystals? You should be able to get some from Chef Jeremy in thehot springs area if you help him make some soy sauce.<br1>
