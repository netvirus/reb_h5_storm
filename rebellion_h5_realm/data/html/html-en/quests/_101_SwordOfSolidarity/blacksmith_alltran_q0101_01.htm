Oh! This is Roien's letter! Thank you! It was adwarf like me that forged the Sword of Solidarity that's found in thehistory books, wasn't it? I wonder how a sword that my ancestor made onethousand years ago looked.<br1>
If I could find the broken sword blade, I'msure I could remake the Sword of Solidarity in its original form.<br1>
I'dappreciate it if you could find that broken sword blade for me.<br1>
