A few days ago, I mentioned the sword handle toBlacksmith Altran over a couple of drinks, and he showed avid interestin it.<br1>
He says that if only he had the *blade portion*, he couldresurrect the sword to its original state, and suggested that since itis probably somewhere in the ruins, we should send someone to go andfind it.<br1>
Regretfully, I am occupied with the construction that is goingon for the outer walls of the training hall, which was destroyed duringa storm, and cannot perform the task myself.<br1>
But I think you would beable to help Altran .<br1>
