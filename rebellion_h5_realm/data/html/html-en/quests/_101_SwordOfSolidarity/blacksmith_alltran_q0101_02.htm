According to Roien's research, the blade was brokenin half.<br1>
I think they're somewhere in the Elven Ruins.<br1>
Or maybe *thosedirty orcs who live in the ruins have gotten their paws on them.<br1>
*Those orcs don't know how to handle metal, so they won't be able toreforge the broken pieces into one blade.<br1>
They're probably using them topeel rabbit skins or something like that.<br1>
Go to the *Elven Ruins* andfind *the two broken sword blade pieces.<br1>
* In case you don't know how toget into the ruins, I'll write it down for you in this note.<br1>
Be careful!Orcs aren't the worst of the dangers in those ruins.<br1>
