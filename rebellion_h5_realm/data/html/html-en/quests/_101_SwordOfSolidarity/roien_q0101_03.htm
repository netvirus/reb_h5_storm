A thousand years ago, war arose between the Humansand the Elves, and the Elves were eventually defeated.<br1>
The Elves ofTalking Island said that the present they had received was not a Swordof Solidarity but a sword of betrayal, and broke the blade in halfbefore leaving the island.<br1>
Thereafter, the Elves never returned to thisisland, and the building where they had taught magic was abandoned andbecame the present Elven Ruins.<br1>
I read about the sword in a historybook, and came to believe that it is hidden somewhere on this island.<br1>
Afew weeks ago, one of my pupils discovered an old sword handle duringhis exploration of the ruins.<br1>
Upon close examination of the engravingson the handle, it exactly matched a text recorded in the Elvenhistorical books that speak of the Sword of Solidarity.<br1>
I am certainthat the handle is a part of the Sword of Solidarity.<br1>
It is my opinionthat if the *rest of the blade* can be found, we can recreate the Swordof Solidarity that has only existed in history books until now.<br1>
