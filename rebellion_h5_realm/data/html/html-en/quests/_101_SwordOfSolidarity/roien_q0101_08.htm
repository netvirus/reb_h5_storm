Perhaps you have heard of the *Sword of Solidarity?* They say it is a fine blade treasured by the Elves thaf Sesided on this island long ago. These days, whenever I have the time f Sisit the libraries within Einhovant's School of Magic, to look througf Sooks and read stories related to the sword. Seeing that it is recordef Sot only in Human history books but also in those of the Elves, it seemf Sertain that this sword really existed... If this Sword of Solidaritf Seally existed, wouldn't it be hidden somewhere on the island? Such f Srecious and magnificent blade as that would not be easily destroyed of Sbandoned... I plan to search the island for the sword some day. If yof Sre interested, won't you come along? (Quest for Human characters level 9 and above.)
