Perhaps you have heard of the *Sword ofSolidarity?* They say it is a fine blade treasured by the Elves thatresided on this island long ago.<br1>
These days, whenever I have the time Ivisit the libraries within Einhovant's School of Magic, to look throughbooks and read stories related to the sword.<br1>
Seeing that it is recordednot only in Human history books but also in those of the Elves, it seemscertain that this sword really existed.<br1>
If this Sword of Solidarityreally existed, wouldn't it be hidden somewhere on the island? Such aprecious and magnificent blade as that would not be easily destroyed orabandoned.<br1>
I plan to search the island for the sword some day.<br1>
