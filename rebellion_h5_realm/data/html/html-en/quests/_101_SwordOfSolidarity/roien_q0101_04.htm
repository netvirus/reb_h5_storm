First, go and show this letter to *BlacksmithAltran*.<br1>
In the letter, I have organized information that I'vediscovered regarding the Sword of Solidarity during my research ofancient scrolls at Einhovant's School of Magic.<br1>
Altran says that hisancestors created the blade and asked me to research information aboutthe sword.<br1>
You can meet Altran by going to the village forge.<br1>
Thank you.<br1>
