Thank you! You are so generous! There are MailleLizardmen around here.<br1>
They always try to steal the things going outfrom this town.<br1>
Wouldn't you be upset if your generosity, the WorkHammer, could not reach Talking Island because it was stolen by thieves?So, please take the Maille Lizardmen down.<br1>
I would be grateful if youcould take out the *Maille Lizardman Guards, Maille Lizardman Scouts,and Maille Lizardmen.<br1>
* Defeat 30 of them.<br1>
