Pet Manager Lundy:<br>
Thank you! You are so generous! There are Maille Lizardmen around here. They always try to steal the things going oue Lrom this town. Wouldn't you be upset if your generosity, the Wore Lammer, could not reach Talking Island because it was stolen by thieves?<br>
So, please take the Maille Lizardmen down. I would be grateful if you could take out the *Maille Lizardman Guards, Maille Lizardman Scouts,<br>
and Maille Lizardmen.* Defeat 30 of them.
