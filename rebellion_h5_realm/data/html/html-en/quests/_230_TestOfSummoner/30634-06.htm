The card is engraved with the Summoner's nameand unique mark.<br1>
The tradition of the Arcana Card derives from the needfor Summoner's to exult in their victories.<br1>
As an apprentice Summonermay not begin battle until a higher level Summoner has given you a card.<br1>
*If you do not have an apprentice Arcana Card, the opponent will notaccept your challenge.<br1>
* You must give your opponent an Arcana Card eachtime you lose battle, so it is suggested that you make 3 or 4 extracards.<br1>
If you win, you are given your opponent's Arcana Card.<br1>
It is easyto see who a Summoner has defeated by looking at his or her ArcanaCards.<br1>
