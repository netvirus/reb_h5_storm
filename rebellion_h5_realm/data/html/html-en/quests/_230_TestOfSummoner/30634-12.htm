Good job! You have won 6 Arcana Cards! This isremarkable! You are the first apprentice Summoner to bring back all 6cards so quickly! Quite frankly, I doubted whether you would succeed.<br1>
My worries were for nothing! You have passed the Trial of the Summoner!Congratulations! I shall give you the *'Mark of the Summoner'*.<br1>
Withyour talent you will become an excellent summoner.<br1>
Perhaps one day youwill hold one of the Major Arcana Cards.<br1>
