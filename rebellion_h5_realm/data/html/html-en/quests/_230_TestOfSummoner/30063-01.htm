I know! You are the summons apprentice! Did you find mebecause you needed an arcana? I can make one for you.<br1>
Although itwon't be very good, it's just something I do as a pastime.<br1>
It would betoo embarrassing if I sold it for money.<br1>
So how about an exchange? I'llmake you a beginner's arcana if you'll find me the goods that I need.<br1>
