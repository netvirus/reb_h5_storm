In the old days Summoners created their owncards, but the cards have become so sophisticated that they must becreated by Craftsmen.<br1>
You are not yet an official Summoner and may onlyreceive *apprentice Arcana Cards*.<br1>
Perhaps the day will come when youpossess a 'Major Arcana Card,' a card that is only held by the topSummoners of the land! The card you will be making now is for use in thetrial, so it need not be ostentatious.<br1>
You must seek out a Craftsmanthat knows the method of creating Arcana Cards.<br1>
*Trader Lars of the Townof Dion* will probably make a card for you.<br1>
He works rather slowly, so Isuggest that you order a good supply of them.<br1>
