I have several ideas for potential opponents foryou.<br1>
First of all, you should try *Summoner Almors*.<br1>
His has been sicklately and is recovering on *Talking Island*.<br1>
You should try *SummonerBasillia*.<br1>
I have heard that she is busy researching a new form ofSummoning magic nearby a farm on *the southern shores of Gludio*.<br1>
*Summoner Carmoniell* of the Elves has been in seclusion in a *cottagein southern Dion*.<br1>
I've heard he has had some trouble lately.<br1>
*SummonerCelestiel* usually resides in the Ivory Tower, but has returned to *theElven Woods* on urgent business from the homeland.<br1>
The Dark Elves*Summoner Brynthea* and *Summoner Belthus* are proper opponents for you,but they are hard to find, as they are not likely to stay in one place.<br1>
Last I heard, Brynthea was somewhere in the *northeastern parts ofGiran*, and Belthus was somewhere in the *Cruma marshlands*.<br1>
TheseSummoners are all proud and haughty people, and may scoff at a challengefrom an apprentice Summoner like yourself, but they will likely acceptthe challenge, even if it is merely to display their supremacy.<br1>
