In the past, Summoners created their own cards,but they have become much more sophisticated and now must be created byCraftsmen.<br1>
You are not yet an official Summoner and can only receive*apprentice Arcana Cards.<br1>
* Perhaps one day you will possess one of theMajor Arcana Cards, which are only owned by the top Summoners of theland! The card you will be making now is for use in the trial, so itdoes not need to be ornate.<br1>
You must find a Craftsman that can createsome cards for you.<br1>
*Trader Lars of the Town of Dion* would be a goodplace to start.<br1>
He works slowly so I recommend that you order a goodsupply of them.<br1>
