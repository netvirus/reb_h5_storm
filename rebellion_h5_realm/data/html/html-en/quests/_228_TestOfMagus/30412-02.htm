Yes.<br1>
You are a wise man, indeed.<br1>
Please find me thesethings.<br1>
*20 Harpy Feathers*, *10 Wyrm Wingbone*, and *10 WindsusManes*.<br1>
You can get them all from the magic creatures in *Giran*.<br1>
Doyou understand? The harpy which glides with the wind, the wyrm whichmakes a strong blast while it feathers, and the mane of the windsusblowing in the winds.<br1>
All these materials are related to the wind,things which I need to control it.<br1>
