Excellent! The *Golden Seeds* of the *Singing Flower*! Ihave experience raising flowers from these seeds.<br1>
One must be verycareful in their cultivation, they can grow into brutal flowers if theseeds taste living human blood.<br1>
Under normal circumstances they growinto a beautiful flower called 'Millenium Flower.<br1>
' To grow these youmust be able to produce the exquisite 'Absolute Tone'.<br1>
The problem isthat I cannot produce absolute tone with my skills.<br1>
