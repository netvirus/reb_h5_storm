You must not be tempted by the voice of the *singing flower*.<br1>
They are evil creatures for sure, creatures that ought to disappear fromearth.<br1>
Find them and kill them.<br1>
Find the *Golden Seed* which bears theblood of the innocent.<br1>
If you find 3 of them, take them to *Bard Rukal*.<br1>
