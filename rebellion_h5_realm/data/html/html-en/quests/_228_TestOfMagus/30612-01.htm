I am well aware that *Perina* is suffering because ofthat monstrous flower.<br1>
I have thought over and over about the problemfor the past few days.<br1>
My conclusion is that there is no other waythan to find the creature before it harms anyone.<br1>
There is not only one*singing flower*! There are 3 of them - *The nightmare singing flower*,*The phantom singing flower*, and *The darkness singing flower*.<br1>
We haveto find all 3 of them.<br1>
