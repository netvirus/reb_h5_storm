Good.<br1>
First let me tell you something about myself.<br1>
Mynights are sleepless, haunted by the songs of the spirits.<br1>
This is acondition common to the practitioners of Elemental Magic.<br1>
This inhumansong is not of this earth, and can make the hair stand up on the back ofyour neck, and a cold shiver run down your spine.<br1>
You must find thesource of this music.<br1>
I know someone who can help you.<br1>
I will introduceyou to *Parina*, who is in the temple of *Gludin*.<br1>
She has a profoundknowledge of Elemental Magic.<br1>
She will help you find the source of thisunworldly music if you show her this letter.<br1>
