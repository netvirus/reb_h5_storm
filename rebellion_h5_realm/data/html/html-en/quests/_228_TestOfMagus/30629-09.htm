To make an Absolute Tone we need 4 tones that correspond to4 elements.<br1>
As you know, our world is composed of these 4 elements andthe 4 tones represent the essence of each element.<br1>
That is, we can onlymake the Absolute Tone which controls all other tones by collecting 4notes that correspond to the 4 elements.<br1>
Remember, collecting these 4tones is a difficult, time-consuming task.<br1>
