For some reason, we have recently noticed an increasein numbers of Grey Keltir and black wolves near the village entrance.<br1>
By themselves, they are hardly a threat, but we are concerned that moredangerous predators will be drawn to the area as well.<br1>
That is why wemust hunt the Grey Keltir and black wolves now.<br1>
Unfortunately, my timeis taken up with other important tasks.<br1>
