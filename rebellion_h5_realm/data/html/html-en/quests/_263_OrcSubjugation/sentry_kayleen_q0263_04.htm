Why are your hands so clean when they should be stainedwith the blood of the *balor orcs*? Go quickly into the woods anddispose of the *balor orcs*! Go forth in the name of Shilen and takefear as dark as the abyss and death as cold as the deep lakes to thoseinvaders who have violated our land! You do not want to give up, do you?Do you not hear the *balor orcs* on the battlefield outside of thevillage mocking you? Would you turn and run from their taunts?<br1>
