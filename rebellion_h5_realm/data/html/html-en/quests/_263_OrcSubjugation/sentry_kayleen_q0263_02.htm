I do not know why, but the *balor orcs*, who had beenhiding in the *Misty Mountains*, have started to invade our forest ingroups.<br1>
It is unpardonable that the balor orcs, who used to be ourslaves, have forgotten their place and dare to challenge us! Accordingto the reports of the assassin scouts, the balor orcs are not simplycoming to pillage, but are preparing for a large-scale migration.<br1>
Asudden invasion of the balor orcs .<br1>
Perhaps those cunning *Elves ofLight* are behind this! These woods are our home.<br1>
We have defendedourselves every time the greedy *Humans* or the *Elves of Light* invadedus.<br1>
We cannot allow an inferior race like the balor orcs to threaten ourwoods! All the *Warriors* of our race must come together to punish themin the name of *Shilen*.<br1>
