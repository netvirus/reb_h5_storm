Go to the woods and strike down any balor orcs youmeet! Someone with your skills can easily take care of the *Balor Orcarchers*, but the *fighters* and *leaders* are much stronger thanregular *balor orcs*, so do not let your guard down! *Tetrarch Vellior*made a proclamation just a few days ago.<br1>
The more *balor orcs* that arekilled, the greater reward he will give.<br1>
Slay the *balor orcs* and bringback something to serve as proof of your deed.<br1>
The *archers* carry*feather amulets*, while the *fighters* and *leaders* wear a *necklacecrafted of bone pieces*.<br1>
If you collect these and bring them to me, Iwill give you a reward according to the number of items you present.<br1>
