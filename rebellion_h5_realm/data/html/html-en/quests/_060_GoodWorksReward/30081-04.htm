I analyzed the blood you gave me.<br1>
I was able toidentify the poison, but I'm afraid that I can't give you the antidotefor free.<br1>
It's very rare, so I have to charge you.<br1>
You understand, don'tyou? I'm sure the person you save will be happy to reimburse you.<br1>
Thecharge is approximately *3 million Adena*.<br1>
You don't want to pay? Noskin off my nose.<br1>
Just remember that even if you have a letter ofrecommendation from Daeger, I can't simply give this to you for free.<br1>
