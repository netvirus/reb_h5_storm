Good thinking.<br1>
Go to Mimir's Forest and catch the *Muertos*.<br1>
Ofcourse, the important thing is to bring back the *Muertos Feathers* fromtheir wings.<br1>
Odd, isn't it, that such beautiful feathers grow on thebodies of such dangerous monsters? Still, collectors from the continentare very anxinous to get their hands on these feathers.<br1>
I don't knowexactly how much they're wiling to pay, but I'm sure it will be a steepprice.<br1>
Of course, I will pay you well for the feathers as well, socollect as many as possible.<br1>
