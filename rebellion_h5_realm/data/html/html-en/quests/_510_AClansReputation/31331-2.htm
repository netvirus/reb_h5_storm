We lack sufficient weapons and armor to properlyequip the guards who safeguard us here.<br1>
The local blacksmiths haveagreed to manufacture what we need, but lack the necessary raw materialsto do so.<br1>
We have been searching for those materials, but without muchsuccess.<br1>
I recently heard that the claws of the ferocious*Tyrannosaurus*, a creature that inhabits the Primeval Isle, would beideal for our purposes.<br1>
Would you consider using the power of your clanto collect those materials for us? If you help us, I will help youenhance your clan's prestige throughout this land by spreading word ofthe great feat you have accomplished for us.<br1>
