Grand Magister Valdis:<br>
Thank you, thank you! Legend has it that these creatures are extremely vicious... Oh, but I'm sure they will pose ne core trouble to such a powerful clan than a kitten with her claws! So,<br>
will you go to the Primeval Isle and slay a *Tyrannosaurus*? *Naturally,<br>
we don't expect you personally to slay the creature.* There is no rule requiring a clan leader to brandish his own sword in these matters.<br>
*Simply stay nearby and watch your clan members slay the Tyrannosaurus and return here with its claws. It's vital that the claw be undamaged,<br>
you understand, which means...uh, well, it's probably best that you capture the creature before slaying it. I hope that doesn't complicatu che task for you!* I'll be here anxiously awaiting your good news.<br>
