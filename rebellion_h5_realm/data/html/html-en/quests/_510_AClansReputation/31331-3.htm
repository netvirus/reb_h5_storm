Thank you, thank you! Legend has it that thesecreatures are extremely vicious.<br1>
Oh, but I'm sure they will pose nomore trouble to such a powerful clan than a kitten with her claws! So,will you go to the Primeval Isle and slay a *Tyrannosaurus*? *Naturally,we don't expect you personally to slay the creature.<br1>
* There is no rulerequiring a clan leader to brandish his own sword in these matters.<br1>
*Simply stay nearby and watch your clan members slay the Tyrannosaurusand return here with its claws.<br1>
It's vital that the claw be undamaged,you understand, which means.<br1>
uh, well, it's probably best that youcapture the creature before slaying it.<br1>
I hope that doesn't complicatethe task for you!* I'll be here anxiously awaiting your good news.<br1>
