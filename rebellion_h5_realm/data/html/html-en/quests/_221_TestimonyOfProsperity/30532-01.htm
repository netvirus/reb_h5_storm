<font color="FF8000">Elder Spiron:</font><br>
May you be blessed with wealth and the virtue ofgenerosity! I am Spiron, the Chief Elder of the Golden Wheel Guild.<br1>
Ah!I remember you.<br1>
Did you not rid us of the goblin brigand? Though mymemory has faded somewhat.<br1>
You have grown much since I last saw you.<br1>
So, you have come to collect guild dues on behalf of the First Elder?Let's have a look at the delinquent payments.<br1>
Oh! I see *Trader Charlyof the weapons shop* has not yet made his payment.<br1>
I hear business hasbeen bad since travelers have started to trade among themselves.<br1>
Iguess his financial worries are as bad as they say.<br1>
Go to Charly andcollect his dues, and then return with his payment.<br1>
