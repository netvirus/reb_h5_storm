Phew!.<br1>
Ah, the guild dues of *Master Toma*! So, how was he?Enraged? Yes, I thought he might be.<br1>
He is one strange duck, that forsure.<br1>
He looked down on me when I was a child, and still treats me likeone, even though I am an Elder now.<br1>
Anyway, I am glad it worked out.<br1>
I'm sure that there would have been a greater fuss if I had personallygone myself.<br1>
Thank you.<br1>
Please take this *receipt* and deliver it toFirst Elder Lockirin.<br1>
