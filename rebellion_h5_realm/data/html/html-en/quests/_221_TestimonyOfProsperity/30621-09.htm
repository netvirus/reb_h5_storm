Yes, we have finally obtained Maphr's Tablet Fragment!This is awesome.<br1>
let me take a look.<br1>
Hmm.<br1>
Tsk.<br1>
Is it so.<br1>
.<br1>
! Well thisis too hard for me to understand.<br1>
It is not enough to interpretprecisely just by being able to read the characters.<br1>
Such a pity.<br1>
after all, I guess it is impossible for us to interpret the tabletwithout the help of the Elders.<br1>
Well done! Now deliver this to the*Warehouse Keeper Parman*.<br1>
This is all I have to do.<br1>
I am planning toreturn to Shootguart after doing some more inspection on the tower.<br1>
