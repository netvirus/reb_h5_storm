Arhh.<br1>
I know that I have to make a*donation*.<br1>
However.<br1>
However.<br1>
My sales are not doing well these days.<br1>
What shallI do? Tell me, what shall I do? Can't you pay it instead of me? I guessthat is not possible, right? What should I do.<br1>
Ok, then I'll just haveto borrow some money for the donation.<br1>
It was the money I borrowed andI was planning to use for buying the products to sell in my shop.<br1>
Take it.<br1>
Here you go.<br1>
Phew!.<br1>
What do I live on from now? Oh dear.<br1>
