Well, actually the decoding of the Giant's charactersis only allowed by the Elders of the guild.<br1>
They never teach anyone themethods of decoding the Giant's characters.<br1>
Therefore, nobody shouldrecognize that I noticed the Giant's characters right away.<br1>
As for me, Ilearned the methods in a secret way, as well.<br1>
And it's not perfectanyway.<br1>
I don't know what the Elders have in mind.<br1>
Anyway, as soon asI saw the stone, I could tell right away that *Maphr's Tablet Fragments*were hidden in the box.<br1>
At that moment, I heard roars from the creaturesupstairs and downstairs.<br1>
I had no choice but to run away immediately.<br1>
AsI said earlier, I am not an expert in this area, so if the creaturesattack it is most likely that I will get killed.<br1>
It has already been aweek since, and still I have not been able to enter the tower.<br1>
But I amnot completely empty handed.<br1>
I learned that it is impossible the openthe box by force.<br1>
There must be a *special key* to open the box.<br1>
I alsodid a sound research on the materials and methods to make the key.<br1>
