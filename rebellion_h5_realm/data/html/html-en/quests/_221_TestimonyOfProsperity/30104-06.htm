So, you have found all 4 of the vouchers?Let's take a look at them.<br1>
You have brought the account book of thefirst elder Lockirin.<br1>
Indeed, it is the suitable voucher for 'wealth'!What is this recipe for? The recipe of Emily? Is this what the woman whobore and raised 12 children, gave to you? So this is the secret recipefor the food that is eaten traditionally in her family after givingbirth to a child.<br1>
It is perfect as the proof of fertility! Is the next aseed? Yes, I can smell the scent of a matured seed.<br1>
I guess it must bethe seed which Maphr, the God of earth gave blessings to.<br1>
Good! Sowhat's next? Oh! Isn't this the Elven waffer! I guess it is from the Elfthat lived for more than 1,000 years.<br1>
It used to be a common thing to beseen, but nowadays we hardly ever get the chance to see it.<br1>
It issurprising that you could get it, because the Elven waffer is known fornot being sold nor given to other races.<br1>
By that you have gathered the 4Vouchers of Fertility.<br1>
Congratulations! Now you have passed the firstlevel of test! However.<br1>
It is not over yet.<br1>
From now on, you must takethe *second test*.<br1>
