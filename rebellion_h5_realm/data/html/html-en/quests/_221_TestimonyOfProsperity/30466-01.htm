Ah, The Great Mother? Yes, that is how my mother isknown.<br1>
She greatly deserves the title.<br1>
She raised 12 children on herown.<br1>
My father died before I was born.<br1>
I was the last born child, and aposthumous one at that.<br1>
My mother had no time to grieve my father'sdeath and worked hard to raise us well.<br1>
She had no rest until I wasgrown.<br1>
Now that I have grown and settled down I can finally provide formy her.<br1>
Would you like to meet her? She is probably at home right now.<br1>
She is a bit shy around strangers.<br1>
Lately she has been depressed andmoody.<br1>
I am sure she misses my father.<br1>
I try to comfort her, but it iseasier said than done.<br1>
