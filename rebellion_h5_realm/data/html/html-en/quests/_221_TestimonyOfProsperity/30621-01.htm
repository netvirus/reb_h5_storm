So, you are the one who is sent from the guild! Wewere looking forward to meeting you so much! If you are ready I wouldlike to get on with the subject right way.<br1>
First, I will pass on all theinformation that we obtained so listen carefully.<br1>
A week ago, I wentinto the tower to do the research, all by myself.<br1>
It was indeed adangerous task for me, since such field investigations are not the kindof things that I specialize in.<br1>
During the investigation I found a veryold, *tightly locked box*.<br1>
The materials that the box was made fromseemed impossible to belong to earth.<br1>
As a specialist in this area, Ican assure you.<br1>
