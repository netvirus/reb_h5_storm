I am Arin Curdhammer, a representative of the Black AnvilGuild.<br1>
But wait! Haven't we met before? You look very familiar.<br1>
Hmmm.<br1>
Very strange, I never forget a face.<br1>
Oh, well, I guess I am gettingold.<br1>
.<br1>
Let's get on with the business at hand.<br1>
Let's see, who has notpaid his dues.<br1>
Dear, dear! *Master Toma* is late with his payment! Ohmy.<br1>
this is quite a predicament.<br1>
He is certainly old enough to knowbetter.<br1>
He hasn't been here for ages, probably still off roaming aboutthe countryside.<br1>
He must have forgotten that his guild dues are due.<br1>
Please! Go to Master Toma and bring back his dues payment.<br1>
He won't beeasy to find, as he is always wandering.<br1>
