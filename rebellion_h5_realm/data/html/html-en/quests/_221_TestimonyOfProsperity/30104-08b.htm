Maphr's Tablet is said to be recorded in theGiants' characters.<br1>
But we *Dwarfs are the true owners of the tablet*.<br1>
Because it was the Dwarfs who learnt directly from Maphr and until thisday, we are retaining the tradition in manufacturing, trading, andarchitecture! Other races who are ignorant about math, dynamics,measurement and architecture won't even be able to follow the basics ofabsolute geometry.<br1>
That is why obtaining Maphr's Tablet has been ourgreatest wish and long cherished dream.<br1>
If only we can recover thesecrets of absolute geometry, not only will we be able to rebuild ourkingdom of Dwarves, but also obtain the power to control the entirecontinent.<br1>
The world which functions according to principle and reason,the world where everything runs smoothly like a well-greasedcogwheel.<br1>
That is the picture of our ideal heaven which we will makewith our own 2 hands.<br1>
But unfortunately, they say that Maphr's Tabletisn't in good condition.<br1>
According to the legend, when the war betweenthe Gods and the Giants broke out, Gods who were afraid that the Giantswill get hold of the almighty power, split the stone slate of Maphr intoa dozen pieces and spread it all over the world.<br1>
They say that even theGods were afraid of its consequences so you can imagine its power.<br1>
