Waita minute.<br1>

Bolter.<br1>
Oh! He's right! I must have missed thisnotation when I transferred the figures into my new book.<br1>
What a mistakethat was! Miner Bolter has a good memory indeed! Our guild has collecteddues from all of our members.<br1>
I will create a *receipt* for you todeliver to the First Elder.<br1>
He has been worried about all the unpaiddues.<br1>
I am sure he will be greatly pleased with your success.<br1>
