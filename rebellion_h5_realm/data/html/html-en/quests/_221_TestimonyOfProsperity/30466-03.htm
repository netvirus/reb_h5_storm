Yes, it is only the thought that counts.<br1>
There is onething that my mother loves, now that I think about it.<br1>
It is a *bouquetmade from mandragora petals*.<br1>
I don't know the story behind it, but shealways seems quietly happy whenever I give her that bouquet.<br1>
I willcreate one for you to give her if you will bring me the materials.<br1>
Iwill need *20 mandragora flower petals* and *10 bunches of crimsonmoss*.<br1>
You can get the petals from the *mandragoras* plants that grow onthe western part of the execution grounds.<br1>
The moss can be found nearthe *crimson ants of the Cruma marshlands*.<br1>
