Great! you have made a copy of the keyhole! Well done!Now please have a little more patience.<br1>
I will soon write down the*recipe for the key*.<br1>
Now.<br1>
let me see.<br1>
Shall we get started onmaking a map of the key's structure? Hmmm.<br1>
I see that it is a verycomplicated structure in which many different triple spirals are layeredand connected with another double spiral.<br1>
Fantastic, fantastic.<br1>
I havenever seen such a thing.<br1>
But it's still only a piece of cake for me,Maestro Nicholas! Now! It's done.<br1>
*I assure you 100% that you will beable to open the box if you follow the recipe*.<br1>
Just collect thematerials as it says in the recipe.<br1>
I will give you the details on whatcreatures you'll have to hunt, also.<br1>
You'll be able to find everythingin the Cruma Marshlands,so don't worry.<br1>
