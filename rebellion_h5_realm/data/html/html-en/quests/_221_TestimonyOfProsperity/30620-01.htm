Great Mother? Yes, I have borne and raised 12 children.<br1>
Surprised? People are always telling me that I do not look my age.<br1>
People call me the *'Great Mother'*.<br1>
So embarrassing.<br1>
There's nothinggreat about it.<br1>
I loved my husband and children so much that I bore andraised as many as I could.<br1>
It was terribly hard when I lost my husbandin battle.<br1>
Raising the children alone became so hard that I consideredsending them away to foster homes.<br1>
But we carried on through it all, andmy children have all grown up and married.<br1>
Well, all but my youngest.<br1>
Mywork will be done when my youngest has married and set up house forhimself.<br1>
I will feel relief and sadness at the same time.<br1>
