I heard this when I was in the *Dion CastleTown*.<br1>
In that village there was a woman who gave birth to 12 childrenand raised them all by herself.<br1>
For that reason, she is called *'Thegreat mother'*.<br1>
Isn't it amazing, that a woman could give birth to 12children and raise them all by herself? I bet there would be no greaterexpert than her in *fertility*.<br1>
What do you think? Will you try to goand see her? I don't know her name exactly, though.<br1>
All I know is thatshe is called the 'Great mother'.<br1>
I heard that *one of her sons is aguard* of the village.<br1>
