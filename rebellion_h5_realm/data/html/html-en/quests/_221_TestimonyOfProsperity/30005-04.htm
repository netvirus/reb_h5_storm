An Elf more than 1,000 years old? Yes,that's right! You mean *Lilith*.<br1>
Yes, she didn't just live for more thana thousand years, she has been waiting for her lover for over 1,000years.<br1>
So that means that she must be well over 1,000 years.<br1>
I don'tknow if that means for an Elf, 1,000 years is not a very long time, orif she loved her lover that much.<br1>
You should go and see Lilith foryourself.<br1>
You can find her in the *temple of this town*.<br1>
She lookedquite gloomy these days, how about bringing her this brooch as apresent? It might cheer her up since Elves adore pretty ornaments.<br1>
