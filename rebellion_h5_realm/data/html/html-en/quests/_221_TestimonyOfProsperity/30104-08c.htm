Recently, we obtained some information on anancient relic which is thought to be a part of Maphr's Tablet.<br1>
Considering that the tablet was made during the era of the Giants, it isvery likely that it will be somewhere among the Giants' Ruins.<br1>
*Theinvestigation team that was exploring the relics of the Cruma Tower hasreported that they have discovered a box in which they think that thefragments of Maphr's Tablet are contained.<br1>
* Your task is to go to thesite and collect Maphr's Tablet fragment! It will be a very dangeroustask.<br1>
First go and meet *Maestro Nikola*, who is stationed there.<br1>
Youwill most likely be able to meet him near the *entrance of the CrumaTower*.<br1>
He will fill you in on the details.<br1>
