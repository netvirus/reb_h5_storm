Well, the absolute geometry is a field ofstudy which was made a long time ago, around the era of myths, by Maphr.<br1>
It is the ultimate study which contains everything about the fundamentalelements of what this universe consists of, and the principle power thatmakes nature function.<br1>
That is why they say that *he who can understandthe absolute geometry can get hold of world power*.<br1>
Our ancestorsdevoted themselves in the study of absolute geometry, and establishedthe academic system and technology of mathematics, dynamics,measurement, architecture, astronomy, navigation and economics.<br1>
Throughthis knowledge and technologies derived from absolute geometry, we couldbuild great architecture such as the sky garden of shootguart, and thegreat palace of Harnark as well as develop the concept of monetaryeconomy in place of the barter system, and come up with warrior golemsand such.<br1>
But ever since the downfall of Giants, most of the systems inabsolute geometry has been lost.<br1>
It is a pity indeed.<br1>
