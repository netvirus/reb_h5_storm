I devoted my self to investigating the box since I wastotally fascinated by it.<br1>
But the box was locked so tightly that it wasimpossible to open it in an ordinary way.<br1>
Breaking it wasn't easy, also.<br1>
So I left the box unopened for a while and started to investigate itssurroundings.<br1>
As it is well known, this tower used to be the researchcenter in the age of the Late Giants.<br1>
But then those ordinary lookingstones from the inside of the tower caught my eyes.<br1>
There were only afew letters on it but it surely was some letters by the Giants.<br1>
Ah,before I go on, I have something to reconfirm.<br1>
You must not tell anyonethat I have noticed the letters of the Giants.<br1>
