This is the story that I heard from Wilfredthe Warehouse Keeper of Talking Island.<br1>
It is said that there is an Elfwho has been *waiting for his lover to come back for 1,000 years*.<br1>
Isn'tthat amazing? That he lived for one thousand years.<br1>
It reminded me ofhim when we were talking about *health*.<br1>
Aren't you curious? How hecould live for such a long time? Even though the life span of an Elf ismuch longer than that of any other, I have heard of no Elf that couldlive for 1,000 years before.<br1>
Anyway, go to the *Warehouse Keeper Wilfredof Talking Island * and ask him about the Elf that lived for more than athousand years.<br1>
