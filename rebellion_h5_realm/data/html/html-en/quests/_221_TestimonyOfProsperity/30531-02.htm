<font color="36DC25">First Elder Lockirin:</font><br>
To a Dwarf, nothing in the world is moreimportant than wealth.<br1>
We serve the God Maphr because it is he from whomflows all wealth and abundance.<br1>
Please don't misunderstand me, I mean nodisrespect.<br1>
My race possesses unfathomable wealth.<br1>
Personally I couldwell afford a human estate.<br1>
In spite of our embarrassment of riches, myrace is still unsatisfied.<br1>
If we could just get our hands on all ofthe fragments of Maphr's Tablet, we could buy the entire continent.<br1>
ourwealth would finally eclipse that of the humans! Only Maphr knows if Ishall live to see this come to pass.<br1>
Oh, pardon the idle musings of anold man.<br1>
We have business to discuss.<br1>
Let's talk about that Mark ofWealth that you are looking for.<br1>
I would be happy to oblige, if only youwould run a *simple errand* for me.<br1>
