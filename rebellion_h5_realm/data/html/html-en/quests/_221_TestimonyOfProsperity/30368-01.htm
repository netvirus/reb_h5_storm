What is a Dwarf doing here in a remote island? You came here tosee me? *The Mark of Health*? I heard news that my lover who I had beenwaiting for for a thousand years died a few days ago.<br1>
Can't you see mygrief?.<br1>
I can't believe that you ask me for some silly mark that youneed to pass your test.<br1>
! Are all Dwarves like that? How could you saysuch things to a person in agony.<br1>
You are so selfish.<br1>
