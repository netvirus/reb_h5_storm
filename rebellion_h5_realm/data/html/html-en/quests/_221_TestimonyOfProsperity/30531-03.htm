This won't be very difficult.<br1>
I only ask that youcollect some overdue *guild dues* on my behalf.<br1>
All guild members mustpay dues periodically, but there are some who have not yet paid, eventhough their due dates have long passed.<br1>
The Steel Gate Guild dues haveall been collected, but some of the other guilds have some delinquentmembers.<br1>
*I would like you to visit them and collect their guild dues*.<br1>
I'm sure this will be a swift task for you.<br1>
Here, take this badge andreport to the *5 Elders* here with me.<br1>
They will give you the names ofthe delinquent members.<br1>
Go and collect the dues and return them to theElders.<br1>
Collect *5 receipts* from the other Elders and bring them to me.<br1>
