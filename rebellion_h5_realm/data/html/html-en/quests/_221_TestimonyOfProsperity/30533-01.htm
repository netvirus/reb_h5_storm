<font color="36DC25">!Elder Balanki:</font><br>
Pleased to meet you, very pleased indeed.<br1>
I am BalankiRollingrock.<br1>
I am the lead Elder of the renowned Silver Balance Guild.<br1>
So you are the one that the First Elder has sent to collect overdueguild dues? Let me see.<br1>
Who has yet not paid.<br1>
Hmm.<br1>
*Trader Mion ofthe grocery shop* has not paid yet.<br1>
I hear business is good, so why ishe not paying his dues? And another one! *Maryse Redbonnet!* I guessrevenge is more important to him than guild dues.<br1>
