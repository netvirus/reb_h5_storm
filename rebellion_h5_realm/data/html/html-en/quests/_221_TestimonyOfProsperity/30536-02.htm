Please.<br1>
Go and bring back Master Toma's guild dues.<br1>
I'msure he's forgotten that they are due.<br1>
He is quite the traveler, youknow.<br1>
Some say that he has been spotted in the *abandoned mines eastof the village*, while others say he is at the *far east region of theDwarven kingdom*, and still others say that he was seen fishing near the*northern shores*.<br1>
