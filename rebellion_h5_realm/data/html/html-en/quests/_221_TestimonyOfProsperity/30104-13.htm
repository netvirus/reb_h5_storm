This is indeed Maphr's Tablet! It issurprising that you found a fragment of the original even though it isjust a small part.<br1>
Incredible indeed! I knew you could make it.<br1>
Goodjob! The Elders will also be very happy about it.<br1>
I will give a detailedpresentation to the Elders on your achievements.<br1>
By the way, between youand me, I heard that recently there has been another discovery offragment.<br1>
Including what you have found out, it will dramatically affectthe process in the research on absolute geometry.<br1>
Now we have to sendthis Maphr's Tablet fragment to the village of Dwarves.<br1>
Only the Elderscan decipher the Giants' characters written on the stone slate.<br1>
Peoplelike me can't understand a single word of it.<br1>
That is because theknowledge of deciphering the Giant's characters are only handed downamong the Elders.<br1>
Congratulations! By this you have passed the secondlevel of the test! Now that you have completed your task successfully, Ishall give you the *Mark of Prosperity*.<br1>
From now on, work even harderto promote to the upper level union member.<br1>
