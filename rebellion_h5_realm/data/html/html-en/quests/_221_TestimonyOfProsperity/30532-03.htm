I hear Cha-Li's business is not doing so well.<br1>
I wonderhow he managed to pay his dues? What? He went into debt to make thispayment? My my! I didn't know his financial status was that bad! I'llhelp him this time.<br1>
I cannot ignore the troubles of a fellow guildmember.<br1>
I'll make his payment for him, and return his money.<br1>
Good job,you can be on your way.<br1>
I'll take care of the rest.<br1>
