I'm glad to hear that! Let me tell you a story.<br1>
Thewar has caused much sorrow here in Dion territory.<br1>
But we have one hope.<br1>
It is Mandragora! Mandragora can be cultivated only in our territory,and its root has begun to catch people's attention in Giran.<br1>
Now realtrade has begun.<br1>
Unfortunately, the first merchant convoy was attackedby rebels.<br1>
Unless we can restore faith in our ability to protect themerchants, our economy will fail.<br1>
And if that happens, famine willfollow.<br1>
Will you find 100 Mandragora roots to help boost trade? We willalso need your help to ensure our merchants' safety near the rebels'hideout.<br1>
