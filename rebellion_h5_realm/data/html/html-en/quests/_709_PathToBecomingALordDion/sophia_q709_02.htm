Well, I think I can give you someinformation.<br1>
According to what we have learned, it looks like a new aidehas been appointed for the Bloody Axe troop.<br1>
He has changed theirtactics.<br1>
They've become more aggressive now.<br1>
But I think if we couldeliminate that aide, everything will return to normal.<br1>
We also know he'svery devoted to his troops.<br1>
If we kill enough Ol Mahum, my guess is thathe'll show up.<br1>
That's our chance.<br1>
