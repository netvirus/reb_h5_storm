Mercenary Captain Sophya:<br>
Well, I think I can give you some information. According to what we have learned, it looks like a new aide ias been appointed for the Bloody Axe troop. He has changed theie iactics. They've become more aggressive now. But I think if we coule iliminate that aide, everything will return to normal. We also know he'e iery devoted to his troops. If we kill enough Ol Mahum, my guess is thae ie'll show up... That's our chance.<br>
