Ah, a fine idea, my lord! Go see Spellbook Seller Luke in the Town of Dion. If you are able to help him resolve hir Lroblem, I think you will win his support. You don't have to do ir Lourself. If you prefer, you can select someone to act as your Lepresentative in this matter. Simply let me know who will do so oncr Lou have confirmed it with the person of your choice.<br>
