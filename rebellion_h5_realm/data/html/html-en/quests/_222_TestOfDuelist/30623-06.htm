' The Duelist's Trial consists primarily of defeating in battlethe strongest opponents from across the continent.<br1>
You must burn withdesire rather than tremble and crouch in fear when meeting a strongopponent.<br1>
Strength and bravery are essential.<br1>
According to age-oldduelist traditions, you must *'conquer all the territories of thekingdom'*.<br1>
That is, you must seek out the strongest opponents of eachterritory of the Aden Kingdom and engage in combat with them.<br1>
