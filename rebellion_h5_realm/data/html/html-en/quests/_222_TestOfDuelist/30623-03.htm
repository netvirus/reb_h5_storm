<font color="36DC25">Duelist Kaien:</font><br>
Greetings, young warrior.<br1>
My name is Kaien and I am a'duelist' belonging from the arena at Shutguart.<br1>
My quest is to travelthe continent to discover talented swordsmen and train them as duelists.<br1>
Though the kingdoms of Elmore and Aden are hostile to one another, thatdoes not influence the affairs of a guild.<br1>
My wish is to train as manyduelists as possible and pass on the splendid tradition of swordsmanshipof the Warrior Guild on this continent.<br1>
