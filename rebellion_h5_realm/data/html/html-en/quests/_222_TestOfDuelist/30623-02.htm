Greetings, young traveler.<br1>
I am Duelist Kaien.<br1>
Theoriginal meaning of the word 'duelist' was 'Challenger.<br1>
' It was used todescribe those who exhibited their dazzling talents in the arena atShutguart.<br1>
They bathed in the blood of their rivals and regarded that asan honor.<br1>
Now this title is given to those whose skills with the weaponhave reached their zenith.<br1>
It is an honor desired by all that wield aweapon, but only a select few may attain this title, and only after manyyears of training.<br1>
I see that you do not walk the path of the sword.<br1>
Iam sure you don't understand the thrill of combat in which 2 swordsmeet.<br1>
You will never be a duelist.<br1>
