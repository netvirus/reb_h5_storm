Greetings, young traveler.<br1>
I am Duelist Kaien.<br1>
Theoriginal meaning of the word 'duelist' was 'Challenger.<br1>
' It was used todescribe those who exhibited their dazzling talents in the arena atShutguart.<br1>
They bathed in the blood of their rivals and regarded that asan honor.<br1>
Now this title is given to those whose weapons skills havereached their zenith.<br1>
It is an honor desired by all that wield a weapon,but only a select few may attain this title, and only after many yearsof training.<br1>
If you wish to obtain the *Mark of the Duelist* you mustpass the trial that I, Duelist Kaien, give you.<br1>
Only recently have westarted to alllow Orc Warriors like yourself to attempt this trial.<br1>
Imust confess that in the past, we did not acknowledge any weapon otherthan the sword, and did not hold the battle skills of the Orcs in veryhigh regard.<br1>
