First you must slay the *excuro* and the *krator* fromthe *Cruma Tower*.<br1>
As a proof of your victory, bring back 3 Excuro Skinsand 3 Krator Fragments.<br1>
I trust that I don't need to explain about thedangers of the Cruma Tower? After this you must go to the *Corridor ofDeath* in Giran and fight the *Grandis*.<br1>
Perhaps you have already heardof the savagery of the Grandis? Next find the *Timak Orc Overlord* fromthe *southern region of Oren* and challenge him.<br1>
The Timak Orcs are astrong race, strong enough to hold their own against the guards of theOren Lord.<br1>
Furthermore, your opponent is the Overlord, so it will bebest to view his skills as equal to that of the strongest warrior.<br1>
Finally, you must slay the *lakin* that wanders through all of *Aden*.<br1>
It is a giant, violent animal, so make sure you are prepared.<br1>
It wouldbe good to have a trusted friend watching your back.<br1>
These orderscontain a list of the opponents you must defeat, so consult them ifneeded.<br1>
