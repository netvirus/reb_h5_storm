So you do not know the meaning of defeat.<br1>
Good.<br1>
thenyou are halfway there! Already you have conquered each territory.<br1>
Nowyou must become the champion of each kingdom, that is to say, *'Conquerthe Kingdom'*.<br1>
The previous trial may have been difficult, but thistime it will be twice as challenging.<br1>
The opponent in this trial hasbeen chosen by all the Grandmasters in the kingdom.<br1>
You must achieve *3victories* from 1 opponent.<br1>
That in itself is not an easy task.<br1>
*Ifyou find it difficult to accomplish alone you may ask your fellowmembers to assist you*.<br1>
You will still get the credit for a victoryshould you succeed.<br1>
Of course, your opponent will be much moredifficult.<br1>
