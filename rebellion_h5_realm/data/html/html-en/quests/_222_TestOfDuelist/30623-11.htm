I personally selected your opponents for the trial in*Oren*.<br1>
First you shall fight the *leto lizardman Overlord* that livesin the southern regions of Oren, and your second opponent will be the*enchanted monster eye* that wanders the area surrounding the IvoryTower of Oren.<br1>
Stay alert, as both are formidable enemies! Bring back 10leto lizardman amulets, and 10 pieces of strengthened monster eye meat.<br1>
