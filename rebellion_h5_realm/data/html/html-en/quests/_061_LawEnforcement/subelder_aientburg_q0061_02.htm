I see -- Kekropus simply told you the historyand left it to me to tell you the meaning of your existence.<br1>
Verywell, then.<br1>
First of all, what do you think Inspectors and Judicatorsare? Remember how you became an Inspector.<br1>
The composition of our race'sbodies restricts Kamael males and females to different paths.<br1>
In orderfor you to become an Inspector, you must be a child of the Kamael who isalso born with *Seeds of Chaos* -- a very rare occurrence.<br1>
Alternately,you must have the Seeds of Chaos in your hand.<br1>
