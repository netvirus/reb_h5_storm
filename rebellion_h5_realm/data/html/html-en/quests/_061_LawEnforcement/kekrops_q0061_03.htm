Ah, then we shall begin.<br1>
As you know, the 3 Spiculas-- the 3 Heroes -- were the progenitors of our race, and the reason forour skill in battle.<br1>
During the war against the gods, they foughtvaliantly, even slaying some of the daughters of Einhasad.<br1>
Though theyfell in that war, their power was handed down through magical sword,shield and cannon, eventually becoming the basis for the three currentclasses of Kamael.<br1>
For more than ten thousand years, we have followedthe path that they laid out for us.<br1>
