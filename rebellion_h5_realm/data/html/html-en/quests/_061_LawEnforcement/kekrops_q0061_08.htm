<font color="FF8000">Hierarch Kekropus:</font><br>
As I just said, he was a genius produced by time andchaos.<br1>
He was not a Spicula like myself or the 3 Heroes, but a MetucelaKamael like you.<br1>
No one knows what became of him.<br1>
Certainly a MetucelaKamael's life span is long by the standards of other races, but even hemust be long dead by now.<br1>
