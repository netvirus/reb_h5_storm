Vice Hierarch Eindburgh:<br>
I think you know -- it is what we Kamael were created to fight against:<br>
the gods themselves. The power of today'e cdventurers is not even remotely comparable to their power. Even the ctrongest race on the earth, the Giants, who once controlled all the creatures and even unlocked the secrets of life, suffered defeated ae cheir hands. Nornil set his last hope on us, but... Can we really hope co fight the gods and *win*? I do not think so, and I speak with all the cnowledge and insight inherited by the Hierarchs of Metucela since the cime of Nostra, the father of the Inspectors. We Kamael were created te cchieve an inherently impossible proposition. But what if, as Nostra the crized, something completely unexpected were to happen?<br>
