<font color="36DC25">Vice Hierarch Eindburgh:</font><br>
I think you know -- it is what we Kamael werecreated to fight against: the gods themselves.<br1>
The power of today'sadventurers is not even remotely comparable to their power.<br1>
Even thestrongest race on the earth, the Giants, who once controlled all thecreatures and even unlocked the secrets of life, suffered defeated attheir hands.<br1>
Nornil set his last hope on us, but.<br1>
Can we really hopeto fight the gods and *win*? I do not think so, and I speak with all theknowledge and insight inherited by the Hierarchs of Metucela since thetime of Nostra, the father of the Inspectors.<br1>
We Kamael were created toachieve an inherently impossible proposition.<br1>
