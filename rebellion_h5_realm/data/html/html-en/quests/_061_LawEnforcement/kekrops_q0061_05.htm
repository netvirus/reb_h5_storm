<font color="36DC25">!Hierarch Kekropus:</font><br>
Before the advent of the 3 Heroes, we were createdwith certain unrealized spiritual potential, but no particular physicalor martial abilities.<br1>
Our creators, the Giants, had little need ofprotection from ordinary physical threats -- we were an interestingexperiment they conducted, little more.<br1>
We did, however, possess aspecial ability to use the soul as a medium.<br1>
This is due to the factthat we were created using Mimir's Spring Water and as a result werecloser to souls than other beings, not because the Giants intentionallybestowed that skill on us.<br1>
