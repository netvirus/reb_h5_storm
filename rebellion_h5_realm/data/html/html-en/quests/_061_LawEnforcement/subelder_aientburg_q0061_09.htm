You may wish to refuse, but it may not bepossible.<br1>
A shackle of the creator still remains in you and mayunconsciously limit your advancement.<br1>
But you cannot allow others tomake the decision for you.<br1>
Don't you see? All you have seen, all youhave experienced, show that we are heading for the final conflict anddestruction.<br1>
But take heart! Execute the laws you believe should beexecuted.<br1>
That will become one of the factors of chaos -- a variablethat may yet influence that final battle.<br1>
In your soul, you are alreadya Judicator.<br1>
