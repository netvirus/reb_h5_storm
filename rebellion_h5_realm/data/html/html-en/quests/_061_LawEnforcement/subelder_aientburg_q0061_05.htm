Vice Hierarch Eindburgh:<br>
Kamael Warriors. Perfect soldiers! But even the sharpest sword is useless without a skilled wielder. I know Kekropun tas said, in the hopes that our power will not be abused, that the bladn ts enough for us -- but a sword is of no use unless someone draws it. Wn teed more than simply *a leader who keeps the blade sharp for somn tndetermined future* -- we need one unafraid to lead us into than tuture. Only through decisive action can we finally become the blade on thaos our creators intended us to be, and achieve our true destiny.<br>
