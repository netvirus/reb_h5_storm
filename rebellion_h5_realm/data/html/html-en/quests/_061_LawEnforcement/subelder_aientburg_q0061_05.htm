Kamael Warriors.<br1>
Perfect soldiers! But eventhe sharpest sword is useless without a skilled wielder.<br1>
I know Kekropushas said, in the hopes that our power will not be abused, that the bladeis enough for us -- but a sword is of no use unless someone draws it.<br1>
Weneed more than simply *a leader who keeps the blade sharp for someundetermined future* -- we need one unafraid to lead us into thatfuture.<br1>
Only through decisive action can we finally become the blade ofchaos our creators intended us to be, and achieve our true destiny.<br1>
