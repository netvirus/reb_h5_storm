An Inspector searches and judges, but aJudicator is required to make an unexpected leap in judgment.<br1>
In sodoing, he opens the path to the future development of the Kamael.<br1>
In thepast, when this island was sealed, it was enough for us merely tomaintain the edge of the sword, but now that sword has been unsheathedand we must decide where and how to wield it.<br1>
