We of the Iron Gate Guild are currentlyparticipating in various reconstruction works to restore GludioTerritory from the devastation of war.<br1>
We've obtained permission fromthe Lord to start a construction project in this area.<br1>
We've been havingproblems with monsters rampaging through the Fellmere Harvesting Groundsthat produce our construction materials, so we're not making muchprogress.<br1>
Other factors have led to a shortage of resources in themanor.<br1>
The Lord is seeking adventurers to help us solve this problem.<br1>
