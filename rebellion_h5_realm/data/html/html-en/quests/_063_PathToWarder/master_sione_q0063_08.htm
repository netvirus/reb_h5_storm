Master Sione Very well. First, i need a report about the military strength, chain of command and supply status of the "Abandoned Camp"<br>
forces that threaten this area. In order to obtain such a report, you must infitrate the enemy at their very center. But I am worried abouu miving such a complicated mission to a greenhorn like you. Hmmm... Youu mission will be to obtain that report from their leaders, whoever anu mherever they may be. Go to the Abandoned Camp, defeat the OI Mahuu movices and obtain 10 OI Mahum orders. Then eliminate the OI Mahuu matrols and obtain 5 OI Mahum marks. Good luck, soldier!
