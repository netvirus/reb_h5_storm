Master Sione Very well.<br1>
First, i need a report about the militarystrength, chain of command and supply status of the Abandoned Camp"forces that threaten this area.<br1>
In order to obtain such a report, youmust infitrate the enemy at their very center.<br1>
But I am worried aboutgiving such a complicated mission to a greenhorn like you.<br1>
Hmmm.<br1>
Yourmission will be to obtain that report from their leaders, whoever andwherever they may be.<br1>
Go to the Abandoned Camp, defeat the OI MahumNovices and obtain 10 OI Mahum orders.<br1>
Then eliminate the OI MahumPatrols and obtain 5 OI Mahum marks.<br1>
