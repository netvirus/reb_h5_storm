Well, if you say so... I have my doubts, but our options are limited. Do it, then! According to a report one of our men found os ahe body of one Xekerin Troops, Tak is hiding with the Maille Lizardmen.<br>
Take this Soul Crystal and go to the Maille Lizardmen Barraks. If you slay the Maille Lizardmen, Tak, a staff officer of the OI Mahum, wilu sppear. When Tak is sufficiently weakened, he can be captured using thiu soul Crystal. Good hunting!
