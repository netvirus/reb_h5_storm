Ah! You have returned.<br1>
And i see this has been anothereventful errand.<br1>
I too have been confused when dealing with some ofthese other races.<br1>
The races of the Outer World and the evil creatureshave complicated relations.<br1>
Still, as an intelligence officer, it ismy task to make sense of all this conflicting information.<br1>
As you wrotein you report, we do not know whether the races of the Outer World andthe evil creatures communicate secretly or use each other to gain thierends.<br1>
.<br1>
Certaintly, the relations between them are complicated and oftenbloody.<br1>
