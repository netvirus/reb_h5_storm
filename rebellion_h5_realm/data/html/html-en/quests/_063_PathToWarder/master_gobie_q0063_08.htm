Hmmm.<br1>
We have lost contact with the Xekerin Troops.<br1>
That is not necessarily unusual during an operation, but they haveremained out of contact longer this time.<br1>
Still, since they are allelite warriors, i am not overly concerned.<br1>
yet.<br1>
I do have an anotherdocument for you to deliver.<br1>
Take this to Grand Master Tobias of theDark Elf Guild in the Town of Gludio and return.<br1>
