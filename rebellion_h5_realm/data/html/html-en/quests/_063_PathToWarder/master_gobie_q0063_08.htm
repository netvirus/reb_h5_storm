Master Gobie:<br>
Hmmm... We have lost contact with the Xekerin Troops.<br>
That is not necessarily unusual during an operation, but they have remained out of contact longer this time... Still, since they are ale rlite warriors, i am not overly concerned... yet. I do have an anothee rocument for you to deliver. Take this to Grand Master Tobias of the rark Elf Guild in the Town of Gludio and return.
