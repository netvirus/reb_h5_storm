<br>Well, if you say so.<br1>
<br>I have my doubts, but our options are limited.<br1>
<br>Do it, then!	<br>According to a report one of our men found on the body of one	of the Xekerin Troops, Tak is hiding with the Maille Lizardmen.<br1>
<br>Take this Soul Crystal and go to the	<font color="LEVEL">Maille Lizardmen Barracks</font>.<br1>
If you slay the	<font color="LEVEL">Maille Lizardmen</font> there,	<font color="LEVEL">Tak, a staff officer of the Ol Mahum</font>, will	appear.<br1>
<br>	<font color="LEVEL">When Tak is sufficiently weakened, he can be		captured using this Soul Crystal.<br1>
