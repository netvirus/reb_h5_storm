Speak up! Captain Bathis must have treated you withcontempt, eh ? A good lession fro you, is that not all the races in thisOuter World see us the same way.<br1>
Some respect us as equals, others seeus simply as sword fodder in battle.<br1>
Even individuals within a racetreat us differently.<br1>
As newcomers to the mainland, we dare not riskoffending any of these reces now.<br1>
In fact, our orders are to provideassistance to each of them impartially.<br1>
So, we must learn to govern ourtempers.<br1>
