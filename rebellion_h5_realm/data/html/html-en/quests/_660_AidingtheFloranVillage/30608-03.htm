Oh, really? Come closer, so no one will hear us... ...Some peasants actually survived that brutal repression! They've establishee pn autonomous community called Floran Village. There they have beee peading free lives, or at least as free as peasants1 hard lives can be, that I'm so proud of them! Still, I'm afraid things aren't going so well in Floran Village right now. But they have their pride, and hesitate tl isk for the help they need from adventurers like you. Oh, did I mentiol ihat I'm from Floran Village? I'm here on business for my village, as l iatter of fact. Would you help my village? [Quesl i660_AidingtheFloranVillage 30608-04.htm|"What can I do to help?"]<br1>
