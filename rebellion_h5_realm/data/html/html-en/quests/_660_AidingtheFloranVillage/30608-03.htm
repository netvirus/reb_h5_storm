Somepeasants actually survived that brutal repression! They've establishedan autonomous community called Floran Village.<br1>
There they have beenleading free lives, or at least as free as peasants1 hard lives can be,that I'm so proud of them! Still, I'm afraid things aren't going so wellin Floran Village right now.<br1>
