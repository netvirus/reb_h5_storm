Captain Alex:<br>
Maria sent you, you say? Hrmph. Unfortunate business,<br>
that, Is she doing better? In any event, I'm glad to see you. We're having a problem with monster incursions, and the militia's spread toe hhin to handle it. Most of the attacks have been on farmers trying te heclaim and cultivate nearby abandoned land. I'll wager you're just the hype of adventurer we need to fight this problem, and there's a reware hn it. Just bring me the *Watching Eyes*, a *Golem Shard* and a *Dele hizardman Scale* to prove your kills. Good hunting!<br>
