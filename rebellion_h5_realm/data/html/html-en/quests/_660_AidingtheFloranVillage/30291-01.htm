Maria sent you, you say? Hrmph.<br1>
Unfortunate business,that, Is she doing better? In any event, I'm glad to see you.<br1>
We'rehaving a problem with monster incursions, and the militia's spread toothin to handle it.<br1>
Most of the attacks have been on farmers trying toreclaim and cultivate nearby abandoned land.<br1>
I'll wager you're just thetype of adventurer we need to fight this problem, and there's a rewardin it.<br1>
Just bring me the *Watching Eyes*, a *Golem Shard* and a *DeluLizardman Scale* to prove your kills.<br1>
