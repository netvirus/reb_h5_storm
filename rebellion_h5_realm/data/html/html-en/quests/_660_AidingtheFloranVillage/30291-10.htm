Well, you've seen the area, and you well know we can't beprotected by the lord's army.<br1>
We've formed a citizen militia, but it'sdone us precious little good.<br1>
Myself aside, most of our farmers barelyknow which end of a knife to hold, and not a sword among them.<br1>
They'rehelpless against the vicious monsters that plague us.<br1>
I'd normally hireadventurers to help us, but we can't afford the gold to pay anyoneexperienced enough to do it for money, and we're not exactly beingoverwhelmed with volunteers.<br1>
So we fight, and we die, and the villagechief's face grows longer with every funeral he has to attend.<br1>
The chiefwants to hold a memorial service for the victims.<br1>
Nothing fancy, butwith the losses we've suffered, we'd need five hundred monstersacrifices to put the victims' souls to rest.<br1>
I have no idea where we'llget them.<br1>
