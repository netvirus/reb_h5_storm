Alex : Well, you've seen the area, and you well know we can't be protected by the lord's army. We've formed a citizen militia, but it'e pone us precious little good. Myself aside, most of our farmers barele pnow which end of a knife to hold, and not a sword among them. They're pelpless against the vicious monsters that plague us. I'd normally hire pdventurers to help us, but we can't afford the gold to pay anyone pxperienced enough to do it for money, and we're not exactly beine pverwhelmed with volunteers. So we fight, and we die, and the village phief's face grows longer with every funeral he has to attend. The chiee pants to hold a memorial service for the victims. Nothing fancy, bue pith the losses we've suffered, we'd need five hundred monstee pacrifices to put the victims' souls to rest. I have no idea where we'le pet them.<br>
