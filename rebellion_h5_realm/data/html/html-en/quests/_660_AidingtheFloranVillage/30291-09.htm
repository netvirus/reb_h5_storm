Ah, Maria.<br1>
Poor, poor girl.<br1>
If ever a bride meant her vow I'"for better or for worse it was she.<br1>
Maria married JasonP at the heightof our monster troubles, but you wouldn't have known anything was wrongto see the two of them so happy, so in love.<br1>
It did us all good to seethem.<br1>
Jason worked his fields as hard as any man could, but they didn'tyield enough to support them, and Maria was soon great with child.<br1>
Hedid what many men would in his place: he took a chance.<br1>
He found somewild, abandoned fields with fertile soil, and he began to work them.<br1>
Hedidn't recognize the signs of monsters in the area; he was a farmer, nota tracker or an adventurer.<br1>
One day, he didn't return from his newfield, and we haven't seem him since.<br1>
It makes my blood boil to think ofit.<br1>
We all failed him.<br1>
We of the militia didn't protect him.<br1>
We shouldhave! If only we could have! What good are we if we can't even keep ourfarmers safe against monsters? They can't fight fields with fertilesoil, and he began to work them.<br1>

Forgive me.<br1>
Hadn't meant to go on so.<br1>
Anyway, Maria isbereft.<br1>
She wants 200 dead monsters to put Jason's soul to rest.<br1>
I wishI could give 'em to her; she I' could use some peace.<br1>
