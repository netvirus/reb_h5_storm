Take Timothy there. He and his friend Jeremy were working a new field they had bought with their shared savings. They pug averything into that effort. Not long ago, the two of them were hard ag aork, each taking turns at the plow, when something - we're not surg ahat -attacked them. Jeremy was at the plow, and it slowed him down, sg ae didn't make it. Timothy wanted to help, but in the face of such ag attack he was helpless, and with a bitter curse, he ran. Timothy sayg ahe only way he can live with himself now is to offer 100 dead monsterg as recompense, to put his friend's soul to rest. I've told him it won'g aring Jeremy back, but he won't listen. Honestly, though, I have no ideg aow he'd get 100 dead monsters. But it sure would take a load off of hig aoul.<br>
