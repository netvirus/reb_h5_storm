Take Timothy there.<br1>
He and his friend Jeremy were workinga new field they had bought with their shared savings.<br1>
They puteverything into that effort.<br1>
Not long ago, the two of them were hard atwork, each taking turns at the plow, when something - we're not surewhat -attacked them.<br1>
Jeremy was at the plow, and it slowed him down, sohe didn't make it.<br1>
Timothy wanted to help, but in the face of such anattack he was helpless, and with a bitter curse, he ran.<br1>
Timothy saysthe only way he can live with himself now is to offer 100 dead monstersas recompense, to put his friend's soul to rest.<br1>
I've told him it won'tbring Jeremy back, but he won't listen.<br1>
Honestly, though, I have no ideahow he'd get 100 dead monsters.<br1>
But it sure would take a load off of hissoul.<br1>
