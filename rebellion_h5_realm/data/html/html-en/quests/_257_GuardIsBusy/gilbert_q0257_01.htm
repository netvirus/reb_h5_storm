<font color="36DC25">!Captain Gilbert:</font><br>
A few weeks ago, the lord announced that he willtransfer all of the refugees from the Gracian wars to Talking Island.<br1>
But, as you know, Talking Island still has many regions where it is toodangerous for people to live.<br1>
The southern village of the island andregions surrounding the magic school are safe, but the inland woods andnorthern shores are places that even we guards do not like to ventureinto, not only because of the vicious wild beasts, but also because ofthe orc masses and violent werewolves that live there.<br1>
Before goingahead with his plans to relocate the refugees, the lord has officiallyissued a command to eliminate from Talking Island the dangerous beaststhat pose a threat to the lives of residents.<br1>
They say that the lord'scommand will be officially announced in a few days.<br1>
