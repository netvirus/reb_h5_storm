<font color="36DC25">!Captain Gilbert:</font><br>
A few weeks ago, the lord announced that he willtransfer all of the refugees from the Gracian wars to Talking Island.<br1>
But, as you know, Talking Island still has many regions where it is toodangerous for people to live.<br1>
The southern village of the island andregions surrounding the magic school are safe, but the inland woods andnorthern shores are places that even we guards do not like to ventureinto, not only because of the vicious wild beasts, but also because ofthe orc masses and violent werewolves that live there.<br1>
Before goingahead with his plans to relocate the war refugees, the lord hasofficially issued a command to eliminate from Talking Island thedangerous beasts that pose a threat to the lives of residents.<br1>
Whoeverslays the orcs or werewolves, and brings back proof, will be given areward.<br1>
Already many of the young men have armed themselves and gone outfrom of the village.<br1>
How about if you participate in the hunt? You cangain some actual battle experience, and it's also a good opportunity toreceive prizes given in the name of our lord.<br1>
