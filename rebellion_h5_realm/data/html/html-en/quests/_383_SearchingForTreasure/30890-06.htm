Muska was a hardened pirate as well, who greatlydistrusted people.<br1>
and Fatima was no exception.<br1>
The treasure map foundon Muska's corpse was written in code, and no one could decipher it.<br1>
When Zaken's ship ran aground on Devil's Isle and its captain and all ofhis crew were killed, it seemed the map would never be decoded.<br1>
Fatima,enraged by this turn of events, demanded her new lover go to Devil'sIsle immediately and find the treasure for her at any cost.<br1>
Fatima'sunfortunate lover was a mere tailor by trade and soon went missing,along with Muska's treasure map.<br1>
