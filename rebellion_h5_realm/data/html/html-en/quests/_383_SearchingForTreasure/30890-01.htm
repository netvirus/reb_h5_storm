As a way of escaping my boring daily life, I have a hobbyof collecting pirate memoribilia.<br1>
I'm especially intrested in anythingto do with Zaken, the legendary scourge of high seas.<br1>
It is said that hewas once Zaken's boatswain, and when Zaken's ship was anchored atInnadril Harbor, he made off with a few treasure chests and stashed themsomewhere on Alligator Island.<br1>
But, the exact location of the treasurechests hasn't been discovered yet.<br1>
