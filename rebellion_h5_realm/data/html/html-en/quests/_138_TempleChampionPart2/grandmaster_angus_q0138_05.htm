<br> You have returned with all of this belongings!	<br1> Shilen be praised!<br>	Thanks to your help, we will be able to send the soul of the dead Dark	Elven trainee to rest with Shilen.<br1>
<br>	We are in your debt.<br1>
<br>	I will write you a letter of recommendation so that others of my faith	will not treat you like one of those arrogant priests of the Temple of	Einhasad.<br1>
