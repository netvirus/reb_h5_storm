<br> (Tell him that you met Preacher Sla and gave him the	manifesto, and have returned with a message from him)	<br> Only a strong and unified Temple can bring peace to this	continent, and only concentrated power can protect the people.<br1>
<br> Besides, the angel of Einhasad has obviously come down to	empower us in our holy mission.<br1>
What else would it mean?	<br> But even with this clear evidence, I see they will not accept	the truth.<br1>
I just do not understand them.<br1>
<br> We are now attempting to determine the angel's exact	whereabouts.<br1>
<br> Once we contact the angel, surely even the apostates must	accept our authority.<br1>
