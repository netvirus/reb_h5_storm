<br> Greetings, adventurer who carries out the mission of the	Temple!	<br> Do you wish to meet Preacher Sla?	<br> As you know, the preachers' goals differ somewhat from the	goals of the Temple priests.<br1>
<br> Preachers believe that the Temple's rigid rules and	ceremonies often serve as a barrier to a true understanding of and	relationship with the goddess.<br1>
<br> And given the Temple's close association with the	aristocracy, many preachers are critical that the priests are more	concerned with personal status and wealth than true service.<br1>
