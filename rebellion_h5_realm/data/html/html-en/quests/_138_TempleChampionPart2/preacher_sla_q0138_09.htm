<br> It seems that Einhasad desperately wants to stop	something.<br1>
what exactly, we still don't know.<br1>
<br> Perhaps it has to do with the elimination of the followers of	Shilen and the monsters spawned by the dark goddess.<br1>
<br> That makes sense, considering how harshly Emperor Schuneimann	persecuted Dark Wizards, Shilen's disciples and the followers of Gran	Kain.<br1>
Interestingly, by the way, those persecutions began after his	first miracle.<br1>
Coincidence? I'm inclined to think not.<br1>
<br> My research is still in progress, so there are still many	questions.<br1>
<br> But I was able to find some evidence that may show a	linkage.<br1>
