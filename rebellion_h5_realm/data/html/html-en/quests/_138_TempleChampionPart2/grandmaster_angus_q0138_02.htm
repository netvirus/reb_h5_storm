<br> (Angus looks very sad)	<br>	<br> Hmm.<br1>
<br> You wish to help me?	<br> Well then.<br1>
One of the Dark Elven trainees was accidentally	killed during an actual fighting drill in Death Pass.<br1>
<br> I am preparing a ritual that will permit his soul to return	to Shilen in peace.<br1>
<br> I do this in accord with the customs of his people.<br1>
<br> To perform the ritual, however, we will need his belongings,	which were lost in Death Pass.<br1>
<br> You belong to the Temple of Einhasad, do you not?	<br> Are you sure that you wish to provide aid to a follower of	Shilen?	<br>	<a		action="bypass -h Quest _138_TempleChampionPart2 grandmaster_angus_q0138_03.<br1>
htm">"Every		race has its own customs.<br1>
I have faced dangers and lost friends as		well, and I am touched by your sorrow.<br1>
I will help you if I can.<br1>
