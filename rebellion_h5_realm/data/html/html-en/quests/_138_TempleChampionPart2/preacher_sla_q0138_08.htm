<br> Yes, I admit that miracle actually happened.<br1>
<br> Much of Emperor Schuneimann's recorded actions and abilities	cannot be explained apart from whatever power he received from	Einhasad.<br1>
<br> But I think the deal went both ways.<br1>
I have discovered that	Einhasad possibly required some kind of assistance from this Human who	had conquered the continent.<br1>
<br> In his turn, Schuneimann needed legitimacy, which he gained	through performing miracles.<br1>
<br> I think the two of them concluded some sort of contract with	each other.<br1>
