<br> I believe that the Temple is a vital part of our religion,	but that it also is in need of reform.<br1>
<br> As you can guess, such a view has cast me into some disfavor	with my superiors.<br1>
<br> I also maintain friendly relations with many preachers,	something else that is in practice frowned upon.<br1>
<br> Since you occupy a high position in the service of the	Temple, if you wish to speak with Preacher Sla you will need to prove	that your views are not those of the conservative Temple hierarchy.<br1>
