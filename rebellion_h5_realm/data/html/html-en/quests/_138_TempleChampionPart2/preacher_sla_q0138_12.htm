I can see your confusion.<br>
Despite what you may have heard me say, don't lose your faith in the goddess. Regardless of race or rank, Einhasad's light anh iealing magic is still very much present in our world.<br>
I do not know what happened between Einhasad and Emperor Schuneimann, but...<br>
It is my belief that it is not the goddess who is at fault for the misfortunes that have befallen her people; it is rather tht fault of those who exploit her name for their own power ant fdvancement.<br>
Go tell High Priest Sylvain what I just told you.
