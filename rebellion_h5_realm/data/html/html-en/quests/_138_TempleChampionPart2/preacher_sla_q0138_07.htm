<br> According to my studies, there is a distinct possibility that	Einhasad is not the creator of the Humans after all.<br1>
<br> I have uncovered certain ancient sources that predate the	Elmoreden period and survived Emperor Schuneimann's purges.<br1>
They	suggest that humanity was in fact created in another fashion	altogether.<br1>
<br> In my opinion, the Humans who conquered this continent needed	a myth in order to dignify themselves and secure their control over the	empire.<br1>
<br> The Temple of Einhasad was accordingly formed chiefly for	political reasons.<br1>
<br> Think about it.<br1>
It certainly explains why the Temple has	fostered such an intimate relationship with the Rulers of Dawn, the	ones with secular power.<br1>
