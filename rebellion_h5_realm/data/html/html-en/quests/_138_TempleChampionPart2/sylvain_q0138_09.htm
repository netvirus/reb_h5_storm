<br> We have commissioned Shadow Fox, the information dealer, to	gather information about the angel from his sources.<br1>
<br> I dislike the secrecy associated with using an outsider like	that, but I accept the need for it at this delicate juncture.<br1>
<br> If you wish to help search for the angel, contact Shadow Fox.<br1>
<br> He will not reveal himself directly, so you should	<font color="LEVEL">ask Warehouse Keeper Mia in Heine how to		contact Shadow Fox</font>.<br1>
<br> She has already told him that an experienced adventurer would	be an asset in the search.<br1>
<br> Tell Warehouse Keeper Mia that I sent you and she should	speed you on your way to Shadow Fox.<br1>
<br>	<br> You have served us well in this matter.<br1>
