<br> Don't lose your faith in the goddess.<br1>
Regardless of race or	rank, Einhasad's light and healing magic is still very much present in	our world.<br1>
<br> I do not know what happened between Einhasad and Emperor	Schuneimann, but.<br1>
<br> It is my belief that it is not the goddess who is at fault	for the misfortunes that have befallen her people; it is rather the	fault of those who exploit her name for their own power and	advancement.<br1>
<br> Go tell	<font color="LEVEL">High Priest Sylvain</font> what I just told you.<br1>
