<br> Since the beginning, the Temple has been deeply involved in	politics, even as it continues to stubbornly insist on its divine	legitimacy.<br1>
<br> But look closer at this manifesto.<br1>
<br> The possible presence of the angel here could either support	their claims or be their ruin.<br1>
<br> What if the angel offers a glimpse of the divine that is	vastly different than what the Temple has maintained is the truth?	<br> Its entire foundation will collapse.<br1>
<br> The only way to be sure, of course, is to find this angel and	learn why he has come.<br1>
