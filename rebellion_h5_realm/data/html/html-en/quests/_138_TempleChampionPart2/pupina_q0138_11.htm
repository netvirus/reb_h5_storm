<font color="36DC25"><html><body>	Priestess Pupina:</font><br>
<br> That is well and wisely said! Both your actions and your	words prove that you are very different from those arrogant Temple	priests, obessed with the letter of the law rather than its spirit.<br1>
<br> You have proved that you are indeed a reasonable person.<br1>
<br> I will write you the letter of recommendation.<br1>
Show it to	<font color="LEVEL">Preacher Sla</font> in the wilderness, and perhaps	he will treat you as a friend.<br1>
<br> May the light of Einhasad shine upon your journey and guard	you from every danger.<br1>
