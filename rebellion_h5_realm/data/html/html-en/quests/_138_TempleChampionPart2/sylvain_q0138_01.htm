<br> Ah, the Limbs of the Temple.<br1>
<br> .<br1>
<br> We wish to distribute our manifesto -- which argues that the	advent of the angel proves the Temple's legitimacy and authority -- to	the various breakaway groups.<br1>
<br> This will give them a final chance to repent of their	apostasy and return to our loving fold, and in so doing escape eternal	punishment.<br1>
<br> But it will be very difficult to disseminate the manifesto to	each group -- many lie in dangerous areas and many more will suspect a	trick and refuse to meet with any representative we send.<br1>
<br> However, an experienced adventurer might be able to both	reach these groups and convince them to hear him out.<br1>
<br> Will you help us?	<br>	<a		action="bypass -h Quest _138_TempleChampionPart2 sylvain_q0138_04.<br1>
