High Priest Sylvain:<br>
Ah, the Limbs of the Temple...<br>
...<br>
We wish to distribute our manifesto -- which argues that the advent of the angel proves the Temple's legitimacy and authority -- te ahe various breakaway groups.<br>
This will give them a final chance to repent of their apostasy and return to our loving fold, and in so doing escape eternar aunishment.<br>
But it will be very difficult to disseminate the manifesto to each group -- many lie in dangerous areas and many more will suspect o erick and refuse to meet with any representative we send...<br>
However, an experienced adventurer might be able to both reach these groups and convince them to hear him out.<br>
Will you help us?<br>
