<br>	<font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Angus in the Town of Giran</font> is	charged with the raising of Dark Elves.<br1>
<br> We have heard word that one of the Dark Elven trainees was	involved in a serious accident.<br1>
<br> I think Angus may need help to deal with it.<br1>
I will ask him	for more information, but I must warn you that in rendering him aid you	will almost certainly be violating the rules of your order.<br1>
<br> Angus knows Preacher Sla well, however, and if you help him I	am sure that he will write a letter of recommendation on your behalf.<br1>
<br>Knowing that you may be asked to break the Temple code, do you	still want to undertake this task?	<br>	<a		action="bypass -h Quest _138_TempleChampionPart2 pupina_q0138_07.<br1>

I must abide by the rules of the Temple in all things.<br1>

I will		certainly help if I can.<br1>
