Priestess Pupina:<br>
Grand Master Angus in the Town of Giran is charged with the raising of Dark Elves.<br>
We have heard word that one of the Dark Elven trainees was involved in a serious accident.<br>
I think Angus may need help to deal with it. I will ask him for more information, but I must warn you that in rendering him aid yom fill almost certainly be violating the rules of your order.<br>
Angus knows Preacher Sla well, however, and if you help him I am sure that he will write a letter of recommendation on your behalf.<br>
Knowing that you may be asked to break the Temple code, do you still want to undertake this task?<br>
