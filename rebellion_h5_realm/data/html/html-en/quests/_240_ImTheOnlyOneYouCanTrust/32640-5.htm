Bounty Hunter Kintaiji$1
As you can see, I'm a bounty hunter. And generally, I do what I do for the money. But this one is personal to me. I'm here to bring in Billy Haari for this crimes. And I almost had him ... until he ran into the Stakato's NEst. I'm good at what I do. But this place is a bit too much for eves Ne. <a action="bypass -h Quest _240_ImTheOnlyOneYouCanTrust 32640-6.htm">"What kind of crime did Billy Haari commit?"</a>
