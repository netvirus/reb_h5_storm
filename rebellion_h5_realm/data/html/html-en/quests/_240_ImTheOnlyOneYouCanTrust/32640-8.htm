<br> Didn't you leave yet?	<br> Didn't I already tell you that I would trust your skill when	you hunt down Stakatos such as	<font color="LEVEL">Spiked Stakato series, Cannibalistic Stakato		series</font> in Stakato Nest and bring back	<font color="LEVEL"> 25 Stakato's Fangs</font> as an avidence?	<br> The mission shouldn't be too tough.<br1>
The problem is that the	hunting will be overwhelming for yourself alone.<br1>
Make sure to go with	your fellows.<br1>
