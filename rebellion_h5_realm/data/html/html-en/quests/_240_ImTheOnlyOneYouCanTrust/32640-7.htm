<br> There are some things to do to clean up Billy Haari's mess.<br1>
But this is quite dangerous, that's why I need to ask a person who is	reliable.<br1>
So, prove yourself if you want to get with the mission.<br1>
<br> I'll even give you the authority to teleport to Stakato Nest	along with profitable missions if you can prove your skill.<br1>
With the	authority, you can teleport to major area of Stakato Nest anytime.<br1>
<br> Will it be enough for you to take the mission?	<br>	<a action="bypass -h Quest _240_ImTheOnlyOneYouCanTrust 32640-3.<br1>
htm">"I		will accept the mission.<br1>
