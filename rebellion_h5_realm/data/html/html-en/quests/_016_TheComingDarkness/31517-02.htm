Very well.<br1>
Based on the trust we have for you, brother, I'll give you a mission.<br1>
Use these five crystals of binding to break open the seals that have been placed throughout this region.<br1>
Watch the altar carefully, you'll discover how to use these crystals.<br1>
I'll wait here until you break all the seals and return.<br1>
First, you must go to the altar near the entrance of the Valley of Saints.<br1>
Your mission begins there.<br1>
Good luck!
