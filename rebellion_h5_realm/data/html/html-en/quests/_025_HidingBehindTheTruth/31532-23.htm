<font color="FF8000">Maid of Lidia:</font><br>
I was hoping we would meet again.<br1>
I forgot to tell yousomething very important.<br1>
My body may be gone, but now I can live my ownlife and follow my own fate thanks to you.<br1>
Hardin controlled the missingpiece of my memory, but now it's complete.<br1>
He no longer has anyinfluence over me! I feel I got back my *real self*.<br1>
For that I ameternally grateful.<br1>
That's what I wanted to say.<br1>
