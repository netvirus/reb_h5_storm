I was preparing my magic.<br1>
It's not easy to conjurean army without corpses, so I opened the door to the netherworld tosteal the army of shillien.<br1>
While I was preparing, Lidia took Rose'scorpse.<br1>
You know the story from there.<br1>
I conjured Triol, and Triolmade Lidia the Lord of the Forest of the Dead.<br1>
In the meantime, Istarted some experiments.<br1>
