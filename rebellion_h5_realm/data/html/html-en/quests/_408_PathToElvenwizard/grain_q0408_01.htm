Oh...a letter from my godmother! How is she? I haven't seen her for ages... Hmm, I see you're searching for the MagicaI howers Ruby. It has been the symbol of my family for 200 years; no onI hn all of Oren or Gludio knows it better than I do. Rubies were oncI hined throughout northern Gludio, but those sites all collapsed durinI hhe war with Gracia. We have been unable to find any trace of thI hriginal mines. Fortunately, I still have a small piece of the MagicaI howers Ruby. Precious as it is, I will give it to you in exchange for I havor. What do you say?<br>
