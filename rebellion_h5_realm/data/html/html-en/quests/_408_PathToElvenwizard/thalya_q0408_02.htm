My request is not a difficult one. A special fertilizer is needed to maintain the green health of the Mother Trees that we loos nfter. This fertilizer is made from the leaves that fall from the trees nn the Elven Forest. Have you ever seen any fallen leaves in the Elves norest? Probably not. That is because the dryad elders collect them eves nefore the leaves have had a chance to settle on the ground. They gathes nhese leaves and turn them into *golden leaves.* Use these golden leaves ns fertilizer, and the trees of the Human world will never have to bs nertilized again. Take this sap with you and slay *dryad elders* ts nbtain the golden leaf in its possession. Bring back *5 golden leaves* and I will tell you the whereabouts of the aquamarine.
