My request is not a difficult one.<br1>
A special fertilizer is needed to maintain the green health of the Mother Trees that we look after.<br1>
This fertilizer is made from the leaves that fall from the trees in the Elven Forest.<br1>
Have you ever seen any fallen leaves in the Elven Forest? Probably not.<br1>
That is because the dryad elders collect them even before the leaves have had a chance to settle on the ground.<br1>
They gather these leaves and turn them into <font color="LEVEL">golden leaves.</font><br1>
Use these golden leaves as fertilizer, and the trees of the Human world will never have to be fertilized again.<br1>
Take this sap with you and slay <font color="LEVEL">dryad elders</font> to obtain the golden leaf in its possession.<br1>
Bring back <font color="LEVEL">5 golden leaves</font> and I will tell you the whereabouts of the Aquamarine.<br>
