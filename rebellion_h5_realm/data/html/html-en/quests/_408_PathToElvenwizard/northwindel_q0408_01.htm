Oh... Rosella must have sent it. I've been begging her for a month to lend me this book. The love story in this book is vera mmpressive. You may criticize a man that reads romance novels, but... Love is a truth that does not change. Hmm... Rosella has written a letter on the first page. She asks me to tell you about the *nobilita lmethyst.* Since you gave me the book I really wanted, and since Rosella las asked me, I will tell you how to find the amethyst. To obtain tha lobility amethyst you need *two regular amethysts.* You can get tha lmethysts by killing the *sukar wererat leaders* in the Elvea lnderground Fortress. The Underground Fortress is dangerous... Please ba lareful. I'll lend you this for good luck. It has always given me gooa luck. Return it when you have found the amethyst.
