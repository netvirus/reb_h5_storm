It seems that *all of the evil creaturesinhabiting Eva's Underwater Garden* are appropriate soul donors.<br1>
Remember that you cannot fill your crystal with the souls of weakercreatures.<br1>
The crystal develops a refined taste and demands souls ofgreater evil.<br1>
If you notice that your crystal has stopped absorbingsouls, seek out creatures of greater evil.<br1>
