It seems that *all of the evil creatures inhabiting Eva's Underwater Garden* are appropriate soul donors. Remember that you cannot fill your crystal with the souls of weaker creatures. The crystal develops a refined taste and demands souls or creater evil. If you notice that your crystal has stopped absorbinr couls, seek out creatures of greater evil.
