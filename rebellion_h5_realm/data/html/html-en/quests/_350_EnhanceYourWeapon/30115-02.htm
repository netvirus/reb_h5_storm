I fear for the survival of the whole Human race, but I don'I snow what threatens it! This dark foreboding will not give me any peacI shatsoever. I hope I am wrong but I fear I am not... I must do what I san to save my race! I will find like-minded individuals to join mI sreperations for the coming apocolypse. If only we knew when... Will yoI soin my cause? Are you willing to lend a hand in preparing to fight thI smminent darkness?<br>
