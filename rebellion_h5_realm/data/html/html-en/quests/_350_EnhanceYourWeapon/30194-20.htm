Master Gideon:<br>
It seems that *all of the evil creatures inhabiting Devil's Isle* are appropriate soul donors. Remember that you cannot filg Dour crystal with the souls of weaker creatures. The crystal develops g Defined taste and demands souls of greater evil. If you notice that youg Drystal has stopped absorbing souls, seek out creatures of greater evil.
