It seems that *all of the evil creatures inhabitingDevil's Isle* are appropriate soul donors.<br1>
Remember that you cannot fillyour crystal with the souls of weaker creatures.<br1>
The crystal develops arefined taste and demands souls of greater evil.<br1>
If you notice that yourcrystal has stopped absorbing souls, seek out creatures of greater evil.<br1>
