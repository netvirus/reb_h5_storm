I have a growing sense of dread of late.<br1>
Somethingterrible is coming.<br1>
Can you hear it? The trees in the forest, the birdsin the sky and the fish in the ocean.<br1>
They know of what I speak.<br1>
Ifear for the survival of the whole Human race, but I don't know whatthreatens it! This dark foreboding will not give me any peacewhatsoever.<br1>
I hope I am wrong but I fear I am not.<br1>
I must do what Ican to save my race! I will find like-minded individuals to join mypreperations for the coming apocolypse.<br1>
If only we knew when.<br1>
