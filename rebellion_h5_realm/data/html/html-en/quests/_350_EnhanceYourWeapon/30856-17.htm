It seems that the most evil creatures in the Tower of Insolence are the *Erin Ediunce, members of the Platinum Tribe and theif Ingels.* Remember that you cannot fill your crystal with the souls of Ieaker creatures. The crystal develops a refined taste and demands soulf If greater evil. If you notice that your crystal has stopped absorbinf Iouls, seek out creatures of greater evil.
