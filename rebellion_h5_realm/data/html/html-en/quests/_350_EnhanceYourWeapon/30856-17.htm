It seems that the most evil creatures in the Tower ofInsolence are the *Erin Ediunce, members of the Platinum Tribe and theirAngels.<br1>
* Remember that you cannot fill your crystal with the souls ofweaker creatures.<br1>
The crystal develops a refined taste and demands soulsof greater evil.<br1>
If you notice that your crystal has stopped absorbingsouls, seek out creatures of greater evil.<br1>
