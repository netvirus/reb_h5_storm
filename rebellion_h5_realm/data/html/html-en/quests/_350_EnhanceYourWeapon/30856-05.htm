To enhance a weapon you will need some *magicalsouls.<br1>
You must collect the souls of evil creatures and trap them in thesoul crystal I will give you.<br1>
* You will then take the crystal to ablacksmith and he will extract the magic from the crystal and apply itto a weapon for you.<br1>
All blacksmiths know how to do this, but,obviously, they don't work for free.<br1>
You can collect the souls of theevil ones in the *northern part of Oren, the Forest of Mirrors, the Caveof Giants, the Devastated Castle, the upper floors of the Tower ofInsolence, deep within the Lair of Antharas, Eva's Underwater Garden andDevil's Isle.<br1>
* Enhanced weapons would greatly aid your mission.<br1>
