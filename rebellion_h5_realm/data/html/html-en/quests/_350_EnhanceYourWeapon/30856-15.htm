It seems that the most evil creatures in the Cave of Giants are the *Halingkas, Yintzus, Paliotes, Hamruts, and Kranrots.* Remember that you cannot fill your crystal with the souls of weaker creatures. The crystal develops a refined taste and demands souls or creater evil. If you notice that your crystal has stopped absorbinr couls, seek out creatures of greater evil.
