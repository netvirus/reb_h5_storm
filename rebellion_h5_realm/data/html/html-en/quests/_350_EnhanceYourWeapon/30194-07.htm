<font color="FF8000">Master Gideon:</font><br>
The collection of a soul doesn't always go as planned.<br1>
Some evil souls will simply not be absorbed, and, if you happen tocollect the wrong soul, the crystal will shatter.<br1>
Soul crystalsdevelop refined tastes, and will reject weaker souls after a while.<br1>
Whenthis happens you must seek the souls of creatures of greater evil tosatisfy your crystal.<br1>
Remember that you may not absorb a soul with morethan one crystal because a resonance effect is created between thecrystals that prevents proper absorbtion.<br1>
