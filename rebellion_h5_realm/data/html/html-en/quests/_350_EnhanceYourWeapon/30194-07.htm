Master Gideon:<br>
The collection of a soul doesn't always go as planned. Some evil souls will simply not be absorbed, and, if you happen to collect the wrong soul, the crystal will shatter... Soul crystalo cevelop refined tastes, and will reject weaker souls after a while. Wheo chis happens you must seek the souls of creatures of greater evil to catisfy your crystal. Remember that you may not absorb a soul with moro chan one crystal because a resonance effect is created between tho crystals that prevents proper absorbtion.<br>
