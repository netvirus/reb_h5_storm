You must hurry and collect the souls of evilcreatures in the soul crystal.<br1>
You will find the evil ones in the*northern part of Oren, the Forest of Mirrors, the Cave of Giants, theDevastated Castle, the higher reaches of the Tower of Insolence, deepwithin the Lair of Antharas, Eva's Underwater Garden and Devil's Isleetc.<br1>
*Take the crystal filled with souls to any blacksmith and he willenhance a weapon for you.<br1>
It is imperative that you build as muchstrength as possible to prepare yourself for the coming apocolypse.<br1>
After growing each of your individual strength, if you put together allof your strengths, I think you will have enough force to fight againstthe approaching apocolypse.<br1>
Then, next time we meet, I hope to see youstronger.<br1>
