To enhance a weapon you will need some *magical souls.<br1>
You must collect the souls of evil creatures and trap them in the soulcrystal I will give you.<br1>
* You will then take the crystal to a blacksmithand he will extract the magic from the crystal and apply it to a weaponfor you.<br1>
All blacksmiths know how to do this, but, obviously, they don'twork for free.<br1>
You can collect the souls of the evil ones in the*northern part of Oren, the Forest of Mirrors, the Cave of Giants, theDevastated Castle, the upper floors of the Tower of Insolence, deepwithin the Lair of Antharas, Eva's Underwater Garden and Devil's Isle.<br1>
*Enhanced weapons would greatly aid your mission.<br1>
