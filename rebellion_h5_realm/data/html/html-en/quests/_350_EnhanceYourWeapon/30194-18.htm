It seems that the most evil creatures in the Lair ofAntharas are the *Malruk Knights, Malruk Berserkers, Malruk Lords, LimalKarinness, Kariks, Pytans, and Pytan Knights.<br1>
* Remember that you cannotfill your crystal with the souls of weaker creatures.<br1>
The crystaldevelops a refined taste and demands souls of greater evil.<br1>
If younotice that your crystal has stopped absorbing souls, seek out creaturesof greater evil.<br1>
