It seems that *all of the evil creaturesinhabiting Devil's Isle* are appropriate soul donors.<br1>
Remember that youcannot fill your crystal with the souls of weaker creatures.<br1>
The crystaldevelops a refined taste and demands souls of greater evil.<br1>
If younotice that your crystal has stopped absorbing souls, seek out creaturesof greater evil.<br1>
