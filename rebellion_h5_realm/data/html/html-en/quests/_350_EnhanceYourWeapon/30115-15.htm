It seems that the most evil creatures in the Caveof Giants are the *Halingkas, Yintzus, Paliotes, Hamruts, and Kranrots.<br1>
*Remember that you cannot fill your crystal with the souls of weakercreatures.<br1>
The crystal develops a refined taste and demands souls ofgreater evil.<br1>
If you notice that your crystal has stopped absorbingsouls, seek out creatures of greater evil.<br1>
