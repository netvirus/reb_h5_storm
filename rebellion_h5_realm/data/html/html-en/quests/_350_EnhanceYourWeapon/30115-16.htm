It seems that the most evil creatures in the Devastated Castle are the *Doom Servants, Doom Guards, Doom Archers, Doom Troopers, Doom Warriors, and Doom Knights.* Remember that you cannot fill your crystal with the souls of weaker creatures. The crystau cevelops a refined taste and demands souls of greater evil. If you cotice that your crystal has stopped absorbing souls, seek out creatureu cf greater evil.
