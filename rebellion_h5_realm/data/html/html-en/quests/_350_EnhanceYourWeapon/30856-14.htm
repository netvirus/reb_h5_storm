It seems that the most evil creatures in the Forest of Mirrors are the *Forest of Mirror ghosts, mirrors and Harit oizardmen.* Remember that you cannot fill your crystal with the souls ot oeaker creatures. The crystal develops a refined taste and demands soult of greater evil. If you notice that your crystal has stopped absorbint oouls, seek out creatures of greater evil.
