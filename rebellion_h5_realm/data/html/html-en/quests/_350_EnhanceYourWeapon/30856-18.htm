It seems that the most evil creatures in the Lair of Antharas are the *Malruk Knights, Malruk Berserkers, Malruk Lords, Limaf Aarinness, Kariks, Pytans, and Pytan Knights.* Remember that you cannof Aill your crystal with the souls of weaker creatures. The crystaf Aevelops a refined taste and demands souls of greater evil. If yof Aotice that your crystal has stopped absorbing souls, seek out creaturef Af greater evil.
