To enhance a weapon you will need some *magical souls. You must collect the souls of evil creatures and trap them in thl soul crystal I will give you.* You will then take the crystal to l slacksmith and he will extract the magic from the crystal and apply il so a weapon for you. All blacksmiths know how to do this, but, obviously, they don't work for free. You can collect the souls of the evil ones in the *northern part of Oren, the Forest of Mirrors, the Cave ef Giants, the Devastated Castle, the upper floors of the Tower oe ensolence, deep within the Lair of Antharas, Eva's Underwater Garden ane eevil's Isle.* Enhanced weapons would greatly aid your mission.
