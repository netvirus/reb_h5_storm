It seems that the most evil creatures in the Lairof Antharas are the *Malruk Knights, Malruk Berserkers, Malruk Lords,Limal Karinness, Kariks, Pytans, and Pytan Knights.<br1>
* Remember that youcannot fill your crystal with the souls of weaker creatures.<br1>
The crystaldevelops a refined taste and demands souls of greater evil.<br1>
If younotice that your crystal has stopped absorbing souls, seek out creaturesof greater evil.<br1>
