<font color="36DC25">!Gatekeeper Tamil:</font><br>
The magic power I learned from the Ivory Tower ofOren allows me to control the door of space time.<br1>
It is almostmiraculous, being able to reach a town on the other side of thecontinent with only a few steps.<br1>
But I am ashamed to admit that myunderstanding of Human magic is incomplete, and I cannot control thedoor of space time with my powers alone.<br1>
I need the power of the *totemspirit of the spider* in order to use my teleport spell.<br1>
The spider webspun by the totem spirit of the spider reaches all corners of theuniverse.<br1>
Following the spider web lets anyone move to anywhere on thecontinent in a matter of seconds.<br1>
But to receive the aid of the totemspirit of the spider, I must make periodic offerings.<br1>
So every week, Ioffer the totem spirit *starstones*, which entrap the powers of thestars.<br1>
However, as long as I hold the position of Gatekeeper here, Icannot leave my post.<br1>
I need someone's help to find starstones to offerthe spider.<br1>
