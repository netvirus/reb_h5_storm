Thank you! I will not forget your kindness.<br1>
But areyou sure you know what is required? Every golem carries a *starstone* inits body.<br1>
According to the Seers, the power of the stars containedwithin the starstone is the force that keeps the golems alive andmoving.<br1>
Anyway, if you defeat *the graystone golems* on the ImmortalPlateau, you will be able to collect the precious mineral that I need.<br1>
Ineed *twenty* of those.<br1>
Be careful! The graystone golem may be slow, butits strength is great.<br1>
