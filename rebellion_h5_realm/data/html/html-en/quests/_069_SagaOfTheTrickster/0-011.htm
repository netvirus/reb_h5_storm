<font color="36DC25">Hierarch Kekropus:</font><br>
I cannot say for certain, but.<br1>
Listen carefullyto what I have to say.<br1>
Several decades before the seal was unbound, aman in black armor and a woman in a blue dress came to me.<br1>
and said thatShilen's power was growing greater.<br1>
To oppose her, our power wasneeded.<br1>
They said that the beings who had sought our destruction inthe past were now distracted and weakened.<br1>
So for the interveningyears, I have trained you younger Kamael to sharpen your fighting skillseven further.<br1>
During that time, the man in black armor and the womanin the blue dress visited the island from time to time to moniter ourprogress.<br1>
I cannot tell you their true identities, but suffice it tosay that they were no mere mortals beings.<br1>
Although conditions torelease the seal were favorable, they still wished that we not draw theundue attention of the being who hated us so long ago, so the upperlimits of our true power remained sealed, even from us.<br1>
But the womanin the blue dress fashioned it so that a skilled Kamael who provedworthy of that power would be able to unlock the seal and wield the fullrange of our abilities.<br1>
It is not an easy process, however.<br1>
