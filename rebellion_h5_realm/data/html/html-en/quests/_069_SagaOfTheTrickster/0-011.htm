Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
I cannot say for certain, but... Listen carefully to what I have to say. Several decades before the seal was unbound, y tan in black armor and a woman in a blue dress came to me. and said thay thilen's power was growing greater. To oppose her, our power way teeded. They said that the beings who had sought our destruction iy the past were now distracted and weakened. So for the interveniny tears, I have trained you younger Kamael to sharpen your fighting skilly tven further. During that time, the man in black armor and the womay tn the blue dress visited the island from time to time to moniter ouy trogress... I cannot tell you their true identities, but suffice it ty tay that they were no mere mortals beings. Although conditions ty telease the seal were favorable, they still wished that we not draw thy tndue attention of the being who hated us so long ago, so the uppey timits of our true power remained sealed, even from us. But the womay tn the blue dress fashioned it so that a skilled Kamael who provey torthy of that power would be able to unlock the seal and wield the fuly tange of our abilities. It is not an easy process, however...<br>
