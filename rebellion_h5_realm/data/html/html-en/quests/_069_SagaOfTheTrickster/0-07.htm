<font color="36DC25">!Hierarch Kekropus:</font><br>
The Giants who created us are long gone, and we arebeings with free will.<br1>
Once the Isle of Souls was unsealed, myobligation to our former masters ended.<br1>
The only thing I still feelcompelled to do is share the truth with you.<br1>
Our future as a racewill depend on the strength and wisdom of those like yourself.<br1>
Youalready know of our fighting skills, but that is not all that seperatesus from the other races.<br1>
We are unique in that we are not bound by thesame gods-decreed fate that binds the other races.<br1>
You know the truthabout our race and you have obtained the power of the Trickster.<br1>
Howyou use that power depends entirely on you.<br1>
I trust that you will use itwell both for the Kamael for the world itself.<br1>
Congratulations,Trickster.<br1>
