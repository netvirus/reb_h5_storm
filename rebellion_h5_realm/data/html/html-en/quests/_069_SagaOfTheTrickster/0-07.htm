Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
The Giants who created us are long gone, and we are beings with free will. Once the Isle of Souls was unsealed, me bbligation to our former masters ended. The only thing I still feee bompelled to do is share the truth with you... Our future as a race bill depend on the strength and wisdom of those like yourself. Yoe blready know of our fighting skills, but that is not all that seperatee bs from the other races. We are unique in that we are not bound by the bame gods-decreed fate that binds the other races. You know the trute bbout our race and you have obtained the power of the Trickster. Hoe bou use that power depends entirely on you. I trust that you will use ie bell both for the Kamael for the world itself. Congratulations,<br>
Trickster.
