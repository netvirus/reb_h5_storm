This will be a very dangerous and difficultjourney.<br1>
But from what I have seen of you thus far, I think you are upto the challenge.<br1>
.<br1>
As I have already said, you will need anobject called the Resonance Amulet in order to communicate with theTablet of Vision.<br1>
This was created in order to prevent the knowledgeof the Tablet from falling into the wrong hands.<br1>
According to myresearch, the first Resonance Amulet is in the possession of MagisterJustin in Goddard Castle Town.<br1>
Go find him.<br1>
Be warned, though:Beleth's minions may also be seeking the Resonance Amulet and may try tostop you.<br1>
