When war broke out, the 3 heroes of the Kamael, theSpicula, joined the Giants along with other Kamael.<br1>
They fought well,helping shift the tide of battle in the Giants' favor.<br1>
MightyHarkilgamed wielded the great sword Enuma Elisha and slew Einhasad'ssecond daughter, while Katenar bombarded the goddess' army with thehuge gannon, Leopold.<br1>
Meanwhile, Rodenpicula used the impenatrableShield of Light to ward off all attacks on the Kamael.<br1>
Thatnks to theKamael, Einhasad and her soldiers were forced to retreat, abandoning hercelestial palace.<br1>
The Giants believed that they had won.<br1>
ButEinhasad, nearly out of her mind with rage, obtained the Hammer of theStars, a weapon almost unbelievably destructive, and used it to rainhuge fireballs upon Grande Peron, the Giants' capital.<br1>
Whole portionsof the continent sank into the sea, and within a day the mightiestempire the world had ever seen was no more.<br1>
