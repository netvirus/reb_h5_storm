I have avoided pursuing my vendetta against the goddess oflight because I hoped that the time would come when I could bequeaththis magical stone to one of my heirs capable of attaining true powerand insight.<br1>
Now use that Resonance Amulet wisely.<br1>
I do not know howyou will deal with the truth -- that we were all created as weapons tohelp the Giants oppose the gods.<br1>
But bear this in mind: the futureis open to you, and you must now judge how to use your strength foryourself.<br1>
.<br1>
I must pursue and destroy our injured enemies.<br1>
Farewell.<br1>
