Magister Alminas:<br>
Have you come in search of the Resonace Amulet? I came upon it by chance while exploring some ancient ruins in the coursI cf my research. I would like to help you, but my Resonance Amulet iI currently installed as an activation device for a prototype weapon thaI c am developing. Since it is already completely synchronized, I'I cfraid that it wouldn't be of any use to you.<br>
