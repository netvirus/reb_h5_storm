Have you come in search of the Resonace Amulet? Icame upon it by chance while exploring some ancient ruins in the courseof my research.<br1>
I would like to help you, but my Resonance Amulet iscurrently installed as an activation device for a prototype weapon thatI am developing.<br1>
Since it is already completely synchronized, I'mafraid that it wouldn't be of any use to you.<br1>
