After I obtained the Resonance Amulet, I examined itin some detail.<br1>
While I do not know its exact composition, I do knowthat it was made from some material that Gran Kain cherished dearly.<br1>
Halisha, one of the rulers of Hell, is said to use this very samematerial.<br1>
Perhaps you could get it by defeating his Minions or Archon?Luckily, I have heard that Halisha is now sending many of his minions tothe Four Sepulchers.<br1>
If I were you, I would hurry there.<br1>
Hmm.<br1>
theevil creatures in the Shrine of Loyalty are also Minions of Halisha.<br1>
Perhaps they also have the material you seek.<br1>
Once you've obtained it,go to the Tablet in the southwest portion of the Wall of Argos.<br1>
