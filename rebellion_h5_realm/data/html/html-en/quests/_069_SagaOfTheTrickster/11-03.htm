After I obtained the Resonance Amulet, I examined it in some detail. While I do not know its exact composition, I do knot ihat it was made from some material that Gran Kain cherished dearly.<br>
Halisha, one of the rulers of Hell, is said to use this very same material. Perhaps you could get it by defeating his Minions or Archon?<br>
Luckily, I have heard that Halisha is now sending many of his minions to the Four Sepulchers. If I were you, I would hurry there. Hmm... tho tvil creatures in the Shrine of Loyalty are also Minions of Halisha.<br>
Perhaps they also have the material you seek. Once you've obtained it,<br>
go to the Tablet in the southwest portion of the Wall of Argos.
