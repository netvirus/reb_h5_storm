Hmm.<br1>
something like that happened, eh? .<br1>
ThenI should tell you the truth.<br1>
Long, long ago, we were created to beliving weapons with which the Giants might oppose the gods.<br1>
That isthe secret of our race.<br1>
Because of this, we were sealed betweendimensions for ages.<br1>
(Kekropus stares of into space, apparently deepin reminiscence) A long, long time ago, following the great civil warbetween the gods, the Giants began to become disillusioned about thegods' rule.<br1>
They built a mighty empire, developing thier science to alevel that the world had never seen.<br1>
To protect themselves from thegods, they also began to develop weapons capable of harming the godsthemselves.<br1>
They used what they had discovered during the war of thegods to unlock the secrets of life itself.<br1>
We, the Kamael, are theresult of the Giants' experiments to create life independent of the godsand their wheel of fate.<br1>
Although we have not the raw power of theGiants, much less the gods, because we were created outside of thenatural order we, more than any other creatures, are able to oppose thegods.<br1>
Just as even the mightiest beast can be felled by a drop ofdeadly poison, so we were created to be a poisoned dagger to fell thegods themselves.<br1>
