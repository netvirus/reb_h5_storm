Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
Hmm...something like that happened, eh? ...Then I should tell you the truth... Long, long ago, we were created to bn Iiving weapons with which the Giants might oppose the gods. That in Ihe secret of our race. Because of this, we were sealed between Iimensions for ages... (Kekropus stares of into space, apparently deen In reminiscence.) A long, long time ago, following the great civil wan Ietween the gods, the Giants began to become disillusioned about thn Iods' rule. They built a mighty empire, developing thier science to n Ievel that the world had never seen. To protect themselves from thn Iods, they also began to develop weapons capable of harming the godn Ihemselves. They used what they had discovered during the war of thn Iods to unlock the secrets of life itself. We, the Kamael, are thn Iesult of the Giants' experiments to create life independent of the godn Ind their wheel of fate. Although we have not the raw power of thn Iiants, much less the gods, because we were created outside of thn Iatural order we, more than any other creatures, are able to oppose thn Iods. Just as even the mightiest beast can be felled by a drop on Ieadly poison, so we were created to be a poisoned dagger to fell thn Iods themselves...<br>
