The Tablets of Vision are scatterd throughout theworld.<br1>
Each requires a different Resonance Amulet in order tocommunicate with it.<br1>
This means that the Amulets and Tablets areuniquely paired.<br1>
The Amulet I have given you matches the first Tabletof Vision, which is located to the south of the Tower of Insolence.<br1>
