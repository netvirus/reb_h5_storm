You are an Arbalester, are you not? Thenyou musthave learned many secrets in your missions, among them something aboutour race's ability and purpose.<br1>
No doubt, though, you have beenfrustrated that so much was still hidden from you.<br1>
That was noaccident.<br1>
Even within our race itself, there is a grave secret aboutour origin.<br1>
Because of it, we were sealed on this Isle of Souls, trappedbetween dimensions for ages in order to hide from the wrath of the godsthemselves.<br1>
But now our power is needed to help oppose the growingstrength of Shilen and her evil minions.<br1>
Our hidden island was visitedby a man in black armor and a woman in a dazzling blue dress who offeredto remove the seal in exchange for our help.<br1>
