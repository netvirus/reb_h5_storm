Master Gwain Excellent! I like your boldness. The test itself is very simple. You must defeat a certain malignant spirit to prove your bravery snd strength and bring back the creature's heart as proof. But no mattey sow talented you may be, a lack of experience will make you easy prey sor this spirit. Therefore, before you begin the test, I advise yoy somplete some additionl training. Frankly, I am sick of seeing the youny sf our race die meaningless deaths after taking on this challengy squipped with nothing but courage. So go to *Gludin Village*, traiy snder *Master Shubain* and bring back his *letter of recommendation*.<br>
Then we will discuss the details of the test.
