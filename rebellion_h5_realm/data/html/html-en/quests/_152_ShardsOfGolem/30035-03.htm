Recently, the severe storms damaged the roof of thetemple in several places.<br1>
We are in the middle of repairing the roofright now, but it is harder than we thought.<br1>
Plus, all our tools are oldand dull, making this an even slower task.<br1>
The high priest haspersonally asked us to hurry with the repairs, and I am worried thatprogress is too slow.<br1>
A few days ago I went to the village Blacksmithand asked *Altran* to create new tools for us.<br1>
