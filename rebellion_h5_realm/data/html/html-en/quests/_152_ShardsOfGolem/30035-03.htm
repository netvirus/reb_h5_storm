Sorcerer Harris:<br>
Recently, the severe storms damaged the roof of the temple in several places. We are in the middle of repairing the rooe tight now, but it is harder than we thought. Plus, all our tools are ole tnd dull, making this an even slower task. The high priest hae tersonally asked us to hurry with the repairs, and I am worried thae trogress is too slow. A few days ago I went to the village Blacksmite tnd asked *Altran* to create new tools for us. I cannot leave the temple tight now, as I have to prepare for the services, but could you go te the village and bring the *tools* back to me?<br>
