This time, when I'm making the hammer, I plan to usestone instead of metals like steel or damascus.<br1>
Stone hammers, you ask?No, we haven't gone back to primitive times The stone I am talking aboutis not the everyday rock you can find anywhere, but the shards that fallfrom a golem's body.<br1>
*Rock golems* live in the woods in the northernregion of the island, where people seldom stray.<br1>
They say that golemsare magic creatures that were created by Elves that lived on this islandlong ago.<br1>
I don't know about magic, but the shards of the golems can beused as a strong, lightweight material.<br1>
Gather five of these *shards*and bring them to me.<br1>
