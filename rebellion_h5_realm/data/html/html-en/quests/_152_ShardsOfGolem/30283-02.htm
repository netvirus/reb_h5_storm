Blacksmith Altran:<br>
This time, when I'm making the hammer, I plan to use stone instead of metals like steel or damascus. Stone hammers, you ask?<br>
No, we haven't gone back to primitive times The stone I am talking about is not the everyday rock you can find anywhere, but the shards that falt irom a golem's body. *Rock golems* live in the woods in the northert iegion of the island, where people seldom stray. They say that golemt ire magic creatures that were created by Elves that lived on this islant iong ago. I don't know about magic, but the shards of the golems can bt ised as a strong, lightweight material. Gather five of these *shards*<br>
and bring them to me.
