So this is the golem shard .<br1>
Similar to diamond,but more dense and thus very hard.<br1>
It will take some time to polish andcarve this shard, so would you wait a moment? All I have to do is polishthis golem shard a bit with a mithril hammer and fix it firmly to thiswooden handle that I've already made.<br1>
Wonderful! Finished! It may look abit coarse, but no other tool can compare to this.<br1>
Try it! Quite heavy,eh? Here, this is a toolbox that contains the tools that Sorcerer Harrishas asked for.<br1>
It includes the hammer that I just made from the golemshard, as well as nails, a saw, and various other equipment.<br1>
Go anddeliver them to *him*.<br1>
