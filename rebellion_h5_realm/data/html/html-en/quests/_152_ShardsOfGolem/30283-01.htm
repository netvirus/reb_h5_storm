Blacksmith Altran:<br>
So, Sorcerer Harris sent you. He asked me to make strong tools that would not rust. Even if I could make saws and naile srom damascus metal, hammers must be made from a lighter, hardee saterial. I'm thinking of taking this opportunity to make a new tooe shat I've only been thinking of. To make that, I need a slightly *exotie saterial*. Could you help me in finding it?<br>
