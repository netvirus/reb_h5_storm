Are you interested in Hellbound Island? I'm sure thereare many connections.<br1>
Not to mention the people of this Crystal Oraclewho were taken captive.<br1>
That is because Hellbound is the stronghold ofthe notorious Beleth.<br1>
Is your business related to the Ivory Tower? Oris it connected to the Giran aristocracy I don't know what it isspecifically, but you should reconsider carefully.<br1>
