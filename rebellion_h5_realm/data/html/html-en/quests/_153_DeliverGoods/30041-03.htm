<font color="36DC25">!Guard Arnold:</font><br>
Following the war with Gracia, our king issued a tradeembargo, and trade with Gracia was stopped altogether.<br1>
That's why Graciatrade ships cannot be seen nowadays.<br1>
On those days that the grand,magnificent Gracia trade ships slowly sailed into the harbor, thevillage people would all come out to the docks and greet the ship withenthusiastic waves .<br1>
Lately there have been many trade ships coming infrom Giran.<br1>
But compared to Gracia, it seems that they are inexperiencedwhen it comes to navigation.<br1>
The recent storms have caused numeroustrade ships to be shipwrecked on the southern shores of the island.<br1>
Fortunately, none of the crew were killed, but even we guards had to becalled out to collect the sunken trade goods.<br1>
We're just about finishedorganizing the goods that were on the shipwrecked ships, but the task ofdelivering the goods to their respective owners still remains.<br1>
We'restill short on help.<br1>
