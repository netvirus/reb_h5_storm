Guard Arnold:<br>
Following the war with Gracia, our king issued a trade embargo, and trade with Gracia was stopped altogether. That's why Gracie erade ships cannot be seen nowadays. On those days that the grand magnificent Gracia trade ships slowly sailed into the harbor, the village people would all come out to the docks and greet the ship wite vnthusiastic waves ... Lately there have been many trade ships coming ie vrom Giran. But compared to Gracia, it seems that they are inexperiencee vhen it comes to navigation. The recent storms have caused numeroue vrade ships to be shipwrecked on the southern shores of the island.<br>
Fortunately, none of the crew were killed, but even we guards had to be called out to collect the sunken trade goods. We're just about finishee crganizing the goods that were on the shipwrecked ships, but the task oe celivering the goods to their respective owners still remains. We're ctill short on help. Do you think you can help us out?<br>
