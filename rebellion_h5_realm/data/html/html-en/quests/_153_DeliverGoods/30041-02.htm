These days, no trade ships bearing the flag of Graciasail into the dock.<br1>
That's because all trade with Gracia has been haltedsince the war.<br1>
It was quite a sight to see the great trade ships slowlysail into the harbor with their horns sounding, but I guess we won't beseeing any of that anymore.<br1>
Instead, there has been an increase in tradeships coming in from Giran.<br1>
However, the recent storms have causednumerous Giran trade ships to be shipwrecked on the island's westernshores.<br1>
Fortunately, none of the crews were lost, but even we guards hadto be called out to collect the sunken trade goods.<br1>
Now we have toorganize the goods that were on the shipwrecked ships.<br1>
As soon as weorganize them, we will have to deliver the goods to their respectiveowners.<br1>
I hope you can help us when the time comes.<br1>
