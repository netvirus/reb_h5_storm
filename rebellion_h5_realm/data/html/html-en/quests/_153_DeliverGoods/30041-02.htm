Guard Arnold:<br>
These days, no trade ships bearing the flag of Gracia sail into the dock. That's because all trade with Gracia has been haltea since the war. It was quite a sight to see the great trade ships slowla sail into the harbor with their horns sounding, but I guess we won't ba seeing any of that anymore. Instead, there has been an increase in trada ships coming in from Giran. However, the recent storms have causea sumerous Giran trade ships to be shipwrecked on the island's westera shores. Fortunately, none of the crews were lost, but even we guards haa so be called out to collect the sunken trade goods. Now we have ta srganize the goods that were on the shipwrecked ships. As soon as wa srganize them, we will have to deliver the goods to their respectiva swners. I hope you can help us when the time comes. (Characters of Level 2 and above may undertake this quest.)
