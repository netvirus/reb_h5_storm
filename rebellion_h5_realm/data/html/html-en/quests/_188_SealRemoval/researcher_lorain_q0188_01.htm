Good to see you! I tried to reconstruct these brokenmetal pieces, but it's beyond my skill.<br1>
I think we must ask *Nikola* forhelp -- he knows a lot of people, one of whom may be able to repairthis.<br1>
I know I should probably visit him myself, but I'm still a litleworried about the argument we had before.<br1>
