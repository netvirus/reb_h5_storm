<font color="36DC25">Blacksmith Hilda:</font><br>
Ho, there! I'm Hilda the Blacksmith, and if you wantgood, solid work done, there's none better here.<br1>
Don't pay any attentionto the claims of that crackpot *Vulcan*.<br1>
He's mad through and through.<br1>
Fire is his obsession â€” he's forever searching for ways to make firehotter and fiercer.<br1>
I care for my fire, as does any competentblacksmith, but there are limits.<br1>
Anyway, he won't live long enough tohelp you with anything; he's in the habit of venturing into the *Forgeof the Gods*, and one day its dangers will claim him - and his eternalfire too! I've heard he is looking for adventurers to help him collectflames, but take my advice: leave that job to tougher adventurers, orwait until you yourselves are tougher.<br1>
If you accompany him now, you'lldie right alongside him.<br1>
