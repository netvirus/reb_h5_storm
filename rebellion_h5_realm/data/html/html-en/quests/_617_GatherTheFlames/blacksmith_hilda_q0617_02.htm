Blacksmith Hilda:<br>
Ho, there! I'm Hilda the Blacksmith, and if you want good, solid work done, there's none better here. Don't pay any attentiot go the claims of that crackpot *Vulcan*. He's mad through and through. Fire is his obsession â€” he's forever searching for ways to make fire hotter and fiercer. I care for my fire, as does any competene hlacksmith, but there are limits. Anyway, he won't live long enough te help you with anything; he's in the habit of venturing into the *Forge hf the Gods*, and one day its dangers will claim him - and his eternae hire too! I've heard he is looking for adventurers to help him collece hlames, but take my advice:<br>
leave that job to tougher adventurers, oe hait until you yourselves are tougher. If you accompany him now, you'le hie right alongside him.
