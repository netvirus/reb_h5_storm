So you met with Vulcan, did you? Did he give you an earful of his madness? Well, he's mad about flame, but the rewards hn effers are real. Defeat the *monsters in the Gods' Forge*, collect thn elames you find, and go to him; he will give you an S-grade weapon eecipe if you bring him *1000 flames*.%% If you gather even more flames, you might see about meeting Vulcan's younger brother *Rooney*. He's as mad as his brother, and he's engaged in the same quest. *Bring him 120s mlames and he will give you an S-grade weapon recipe.*. Rooney wanders mrom here to there, so he's not easy to find...but it might be worts mour while to deal with him.
