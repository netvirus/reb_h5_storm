So you met with Vulcan, did you? Did he give you anearful of his madness? Well, he's mad about flame, but the rewards heoffers are real.<br1>
Defeat the *monsters in the Gods' Forge*, collect theflames you find, and go to him; he will give you an S-grade weaponrecipe if you bring him *1000 flames*.<br1>
If you gather even more flames,you might see about meeting Vulcan's younger brother *Rooney*.<br1>
He's asmad as his brother, and he's engaged in the same quest.<br1>
*Bring him 1200flames and he will give you an S-grade weapon recipe.<br1>
*.<br1>
Rooney wandersfrom here to there, so he's not easy to find.<br1>
but it might be worthyour while to deal with him.<br1>
