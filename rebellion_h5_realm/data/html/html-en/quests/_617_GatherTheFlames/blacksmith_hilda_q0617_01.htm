I've a tale to interest you.<br1>
Have you heard tell of*Vulcan*, the blacksmith? Now, all us blacksmiths have much to say aboutfire — we depend on it for our livelihood.<br1>
Vulcan, though, he spoke ofnothing else, and his talk was the marvel of all who heard it.<br1>
He saidthat the fire was the actual life of the blacksmith, and could think ofnothing but ways to make his fire hotter and fiercer.<br1>
Eventually, hefollowed his notions right into the deeps of the *Gods' Forge*, where hesaid he could collect and use all the fire he could want.<br1>
It's ahorribly dangerous place, and he's looking for those who can accompanyhim, adventurers who are not shy of danger and who can help him collectthe flames.<br1>
