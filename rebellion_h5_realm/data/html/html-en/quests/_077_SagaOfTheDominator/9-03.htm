A sharp blast of knowlege courses through yourcranium! A vision appears of a black knight! And a long line ofancient kings! King of Unification Raul, Old King van Halter, King ofInsolence Baium, Founding Emperor Shunaiman and the Queen of ElvesBeora.<br1>
Those were the days! An Orc was the advance guard and an Elfwas the page.<br1>
And there is the King of the Giants! He was the best king,but his insolence poisoned his relationship with the goddess.<br1>
A kingof evil creeping in darkness with the power of a ruler! A kingdomrises or falls depending on the heart of its King! Only a very few areworthy to be called King! What does it mean to be King? Successor ofFlame Akkan left to meet a tyrant with that question on his mind.<br1>
