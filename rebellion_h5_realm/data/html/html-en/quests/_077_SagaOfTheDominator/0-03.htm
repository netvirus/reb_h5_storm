Flame Lord Kakai has truly amazing power! Withouthim we would never survive the endless winter! But alas, he has nosuccessor.<br1>
If he dies now, who will save us? Overlords are quite rarein these parts.<br1>
Among them, those worthy of becoming king are evenfewer! I've lost touch with Cardia of the Hestui tribe and Akkan of theNeruga tribe.<br1>
Even Atlus of the Gandi tribe has disappeared without atrace! You're my only hope! All I could find out from the Dudamara waswhere Flame Successor Akkan may be headed! Please go after him, myOverlord! I've heard that a Ketra Orc Messenger of the Betrayer LesserOrcs has met with him.<br1>
