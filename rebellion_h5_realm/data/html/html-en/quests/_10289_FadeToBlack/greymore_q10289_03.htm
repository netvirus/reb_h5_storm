Priest Greymore:<br>
Alright. I've been here studying these confounding monks and their secrets, but so far I've been unable to find anything og mny information of value. Bloody quiet lot, these. I suspect we musg mapture someone higher up the chain of command, as it were.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Master of Splendor Annays</font><br>
is who I have in mind. Capture him and bring me his mark, what these monks call the<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Mark of Splendor</font><br>
. Only he will have it, none of the others. They carry a<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Mark of Darkness</font><br>
, and should you bring me back that, the only reward you will receive is my cackle.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">The Mark of Splendor is what earns the reward</font><br>
