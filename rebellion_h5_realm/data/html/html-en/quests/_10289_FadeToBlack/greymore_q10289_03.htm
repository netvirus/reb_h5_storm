Alright.<br1>
I've been here studying these confoundingmonks and their secrets, but so far I've been unable to find anything orany information of value.<br1>
Bloody quiet lot, these.<br1>
I suspect we mustcapture someone higher up the chain of command, as it were.<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">Master of Splendor Annays</font>is who I have in mind.<br1>
Capture him and bring me his mark, what thesemonks call the<font color="LEVEL">Mark of Splendor</font>.<br1>
Only he will have it, none of the others.<br1>
They carry a<font color="LEVEL">Mark of Darkness</font>, and should you bring me back that, the only reward you will receive ismy cackle.<br1>
