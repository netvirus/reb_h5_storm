Good job.<br1>
You proved yourself able to do more thanjust startle me on a consistent basis.<br1>
The timing couldn't be better,I've grown weary of this Monastery and these idiotic mute monks.<br1>
PerhapsDominic will give me a position back in the Town of Rune.<br1>
Thanks again.<br1>
Hopefully I will see you in Rune next time.<br1>
