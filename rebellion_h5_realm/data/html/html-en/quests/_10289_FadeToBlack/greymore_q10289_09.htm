Good job. You proved yourself able to do more than just startle me on a consistent basis. The timing couldn't be better,<br>
I've grown weary of this Monastery and these idiotic mute monks. Perhaps Dominic will give me a position back in the Town of Rune. Thanks again.<br>
Hopefully I will see you in Rune next time.<br>
