Some time ago *Rockswell* asked me to craft a*doll* in the shape of a maiden.<br1>
He must be giving it as a gift to hisgranddaughter or something.<br1>
But I can't make the hair yet, as I don'thave any yarn.<br1>
*Rockswell* said that he would find me some yarn spunfrom the fur of the *keltir* .<br1>
