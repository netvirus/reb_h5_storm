Ah, you've been sent by *Rockswell*.<br1>
Such fine, soft fur.<br1>
Ithink we have plenty here.<br1>
Please wait a moment, I will spin you thatyarn right now.<br1>
Here is your spool of yarn.<br1>
I wonder, is *Rockswell*about to sew or something.<br1>
Ah, and please tell Mr.<br1>
*Rockswell* that Iam knitting a woolen coat for him to wear this winter.<br1>
It must be hardfor him to weather the cold sea winds and guard the lighthouse allalone.<br1>
Tsk tsk.<br1>
