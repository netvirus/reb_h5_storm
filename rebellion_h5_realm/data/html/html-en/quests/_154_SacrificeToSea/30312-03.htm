Lighthouse Keeper Rockswell:<br>
The goddess of the seas must be really angry this year. The recent storms were fierce, unlike anything evey aeen before. They say that trade ships sailing to Giran have beey ahipwrecked in these parts ... the waves don't seem normal this year.<br>
You know, this is all because they haven't made *offerings* to Shilen goddess of the sea. From long, long ago our ancestors who lived on this island made a sacrifice to Shilen, goddess of the deep seas, every yeas ior the safety of all ships that sail into these harbors. But now moss if the residents have forgotten this tradition. I'm sure that is whas ias made the goddess so angry. Fallius, the Wharf Manager, and I stils iontinue this ceremony every year. We have not been able to hold ths iitual this year yet, as the newly appointed Priest to the islans ioesn't like it. But see what happens? I think it would be best to hols ihe ceremony, even if it means doing it in secret. That is the only was io calm the raging waves and violent waters. Do you think you can help?<br>
I need the help of someone else in order to prepare for the ceremony.<br>
