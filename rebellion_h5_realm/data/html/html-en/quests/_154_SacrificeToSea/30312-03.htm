The goddess of the seas must be reallyangry this year.<br1>
The recent storms were fierce, unlike anything everseen before.<br1>
They say that trade ships sailing to Giran have beenshipwrecked in these parts .<br1>
the waves don't seem normal this year.<br1>
You know, this is all because they haven't made *offerings* to Shilen,goddess of the sea.<br1>
From long, long ago our ancestors who lived on thisisland made a sacrifice to Shilen, goddess of the deep seas, every yearfor the safety of all ships that sail into these harbors.<br1>
But now mostof the residents have forgotten this tradition.<br1>
I'm sure that is whathas made the goddess so angry.<br1>
Fallius, the Wharf Manager, and I stillcontinue this ceremony every year.<br1>
We have not been able to hold theritual this year yet, as the newly appointed Priest to the islanddoesn't like it.<br1>
But see what happens? I think it would be best to holdthe ceremony, even if it means doing it in secret.<br1>
That is the only wayto calm the raging waves and violent waters.<br1>
Do you think you can help?I need the help of someone else in order to prepare for the ceremony.<br1>
