Long ago, they say they sacrificed virginsto the sea, but times have changed and there is no sailor who keeps thistradition.<br1>
Instead, we set afloat a boat that contains a doll in theshape of a Human maiden.<br1>
Now we have to make that doll.<br1>
I've asked*Warehouse Keeper Rolfe*, who is handy with his hands, to make the doll,but we still have to make the doll's long hair.<br1>
For that, I need highquality *fur yarn*.<br1>
Hunt the *keltirs* on the island and gather aboutten bundles of fur, then take them to *Cristel* in the next village.<br1>
Youcan find her at the well in *front of the village warehouse*.<br1>
Give thefur to *Cristel*, and she will spin it into yarn.<br1>
Take the yarn and giveit to *Warehouse Keeper Rolfe*.<br1>
He will probably finish the doll on thespot.<br1>
As soon as the *doll* is finished, bring it back to me.<br1>
I willgive you generous reward for your labor.<br1>
