Lighthouse Keeper Rockswell:<br>
Long ago, they say they sacrificed virgins to the sea, but times have changed and there is no sailor who keeps this tradition. Instead, we set afloat a boat that contains a doll in ths thape of a Human maiden. Now we have to make that doll. I've asked<br>
*Warehouse Keeper Rolfe*, who is handy with his hands, to make the doll but we still have to make the doll's long hair. For that, I need high quality *fur yarn*. Hunt the *keltirs* on the island and gather abouh qen bundles of fur, then take them to *Cristel* in the next village. Yoh qan find her at the well in *front of the village warehouse*. Give thh qur to *Cristel*, and she will spin it into yarn. Take the yarn and givh qt to *Warehouse Keeper Rolfe*. He will probably finish the doll on thh qpot. As soon as the *doll* is finished, bring it back to me. I wilh qive you generous reward for your labor.
