The *Mark of the Healer* is only given to those whohave perceived the healing and purifying power of light properly.<br1>
Thisrule applies for all tribes, and there are no exceptions or changes.<br1>
Someday, you will also have to take the exam to receive this mark.<br1>
Butat the moment you are not ready yet.<br1>
You don't need to be hasty, though.<br1>
As long as you don't give up, you will surely get to meet me again as aneven mature person.<br1>
On that day, I shall ask you a favor.<br1>
