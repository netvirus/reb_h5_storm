The Dark Elf who kidnapped me said somethingstrange.<br1>
That the Goddess is already waking up.<br1>
Although I do not knowwhat it means.<br1>
But I realized one thing for sure.<br1>
That this was mydestiny, to be kidnapped here.<br1>
I shall remain here.<br1>
It is not yet timefor me to go back to the shrine.<br1>
It is my duty to spread the words oflight in the forest of darkness.<br1>
The Dark Elves have the right to knowabout the truth of light, as well.<br1>
To survive the days of ChaoticChronicle, we all need to cooperate.<br1>
I want you to deliver this letterto *Master Sorius*.<br1>
Please.<br1>
