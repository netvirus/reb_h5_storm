This case is going in the wrong direction.<br1>
I think weneed to send a special guard to protect her.<br1>
And we'd better report thisto the High Priest.<br1>
I heard your story from Master Sorius.<br1>
He said thatyou were a great help in this case and praised you a lot.<br1>
In my mind aswell, I think you have already proven that you are qualified.<br1>
Theremight come a day when I shall need your help again.<br1>
I hope you keep upwith your practices for that day.<br1>
By the way.<br1>
The thing that you areholding in your hands.<br1>
It has been bothering me.<br1>
It looks just likewhat we have lost in the church.<br1>
