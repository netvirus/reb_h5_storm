Ah, It seems you are talking about Christina.<br1>
But you'retoo late! She was recently kidnapped by some strange men that broke intothe orphanage! Curse the fiends! What is this world coming to! And whathave they done with *Wendy*? No no, Ari, father is not mad! AfterChristina's kidnapping, the Elf masters of the Town of Gludio came tohelp search for her, and now you.<br1>
And all of them ignoring the fact thatthe orphanage is in ruins and the children are starving! If only I had*100,000 adena*, I would be able to buy beds for these children.<br1>
