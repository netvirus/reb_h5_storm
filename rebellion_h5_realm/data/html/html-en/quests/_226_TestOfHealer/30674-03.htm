Hmm.<br1>
what does this say? 'Perform the ritual atthe Obelisk of Shilen'.<br1>
.<br1>
I think they took the girl to *the obelisk inthe Dark Forest.<br1>
* Then the *Dark Elves* are involved in this case? Cursethem! There are many obelisks in the Dark Forest.<br1>
We can't figure outwhich obelisk they are at with only this?! In any case, we have to trackthem as soon as possible.<br1>
We must save the holy maiden before shebecomes sacrificed.<br1>
I am a Dwarf and slow on my feet, so you shouldleave first.<br1>
I will send swift supporters to aid you, so hurry! Theymust be going to a place with an altar.<br1>
! I will inform Sorius aboutthe situation.<br1>
