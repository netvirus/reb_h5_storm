Oh, you mean the saintess? Of course, of course, if you arehere to ask about the saintess, you have found the right person.<br1>
I guessyou are the one who was sent here as a representative of the shrine.<br1>
Iheard the news already.<br1>
If you want, it is possible that I let youescort her to your place, besides having a meeting with her.<br1>
But, thereis one condition.<br1>
While we were searching for, and protecting thesaintess .<br1>
we had quite a bit of expenses.<br1>
I'm hoping that theshrine will compensate those expenses? That is about *100,000Adena*.<br1>
