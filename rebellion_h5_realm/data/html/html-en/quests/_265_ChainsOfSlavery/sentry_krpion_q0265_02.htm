Have you seen *imps* in the forest? Those hideouscreatures were once slaves that served our race.<br1>
However, when we wereat war with the Elves of Light, they undid the spells of restraintthrough some unknown method and escaped aboveground.<br1>
When I look at thelowly race that used to serve us parading around aboveground, I feel so.<br1>
I cannot contain my hurt pride.<br1>
However, recently *Tetrarch Velior*said he is preparing a spell that will make the imps submissive again.<br1>
But he mentioned that he needs the *shackles* from around their necks inorder to complete the spell.<br1>
