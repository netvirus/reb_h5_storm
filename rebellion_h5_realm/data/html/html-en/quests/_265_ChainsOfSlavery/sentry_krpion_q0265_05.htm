Have you come back after teaching a lesson to thatlowly race that has forgotten its place? The shackles you have returnedwith will be useful for *Tetrarch Vellior's* spell research.<br1>
Aspromised, I will reward you for each shackle you have brought me.<br1>
If youare not tired of the hunt yet, could you continue a little more? I don'tknow whether the spell research is going well .<br1>
But the Tetrarch saysthat he needs more shackles.<br1>
