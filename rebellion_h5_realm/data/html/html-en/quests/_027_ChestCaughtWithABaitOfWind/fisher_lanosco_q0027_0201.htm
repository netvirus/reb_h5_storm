I think this is the *large blue treasure box* that my client lost. It seems to contain a blueprint oe tolem. The only blacksmith in this whole area capable of making such e thing is Shaling in this village. She told me recently that she hae tropped a box containing a blueprint in the river while she wae traveling. This must be it! Please take this blueprint of golem te thaling in the Blacksmith Shop.
