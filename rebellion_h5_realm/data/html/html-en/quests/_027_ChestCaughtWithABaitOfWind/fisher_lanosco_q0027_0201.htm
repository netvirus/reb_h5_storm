I think this is the *large bluetreasure box* that my client lost.<br1>
It seems to contain a blueprint ofgolem.<br1>
The only blacksmith in this whole area capable of making such athing is Shaling in this village.<br1>
She told me recently that she haddropped a box containing a blueprint in the river while she wastraveling.<br1>
This must be it! Please take this blueprint of golem toShaling in the Blacksmith Shop.<br1>
