A while back someone was here askingabout a *large blue treasure box*.<br1>
The bait I gave you earlier wasdesigned to find it! Don't look so hurt! It only works if the personusing it doesn't know about it.<br1>
If you haven't found it yet, pleasecontinue to look for it.<br1>
Only you can use that bait now.<br1>
This should beeasy for you! I can't tell you who the *large blue treasure box* belongsto now, but I will if you find it! It was lost near the shore.<br1>
Look forit there.<br1>
Your fishing skill must be level 9 and you must bring the boxto me unopened.<br1>
Someone else may have found it by now, so make sure toask around about it in the market.<br1>
