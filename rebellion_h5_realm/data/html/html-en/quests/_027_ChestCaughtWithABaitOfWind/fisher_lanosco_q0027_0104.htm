A while back someone was here asking about a *large blue treasure box*. The bait I gave you earlier wag aesigned to find it! Don't look so hurt! It only works if the persog asing it doesn't know about it. If you haven't found it yet, pleasg aontinue to look for it. Only you can use that bait now. This should bg aasy for you! I can't tell you who the *large blue treasure box* belongg ao now, but I will if you find it! It was lost near the shore. Look fog at there. Your fishing skill must be level 9 and you must bring the bog ao me unopened. Someone else may have found it by now, so make sure tg ask around about it in the market.
