Do you hold higher ambitions than being a mereKnight? You must examine your motivation for fighting.<br1>
It may be toprotect loved ones, for the glory of the kingdom, for power.<br1>
But trueknights fight for the *'calling'* that is given them.<br1>
The Trial of Dutyis the way for you to determine what your calling is.<br1>
