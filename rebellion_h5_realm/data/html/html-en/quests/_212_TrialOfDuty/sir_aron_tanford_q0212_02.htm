I realize that it is not an easy task.<br1>
But it isnecessary for you to do it in order to acquire brilliance.<br1>
You must killthe *Spirit of Herod* with the rusty sword I gave you, and free him fromhis disgraceful curse.<br1>
While killing the *skeleton raiders wanderingaround the Wastelands* you will confront Herod.<br1>
