*The Orcs have an appalling custom of carrying aroundthe remains of their enemies as a sort of charm or amulet.<br1>
* They saythat the more courageous the enemy, the greater the power.<br1>
It is saidthat Athebaldt's remains were cut up into pieces and and fashioned intoamulets for the *Breka Orc Overlords*.<br1>
These creatures are fierce andviolent! But I must give Leon a proper burial.<br1>
