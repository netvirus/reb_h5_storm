Last winter a giant horde of blood-thirsty *Breka Orcs*swept in from the north and invaded Giran.<br1>
Those violent thugs lootedhomes and businesses, and even threatened the castle.<br1>
They gave theRoyal Guards quite a challenge.<br1>
Leon Athebaldt led his men in an attackon the Breka Orc encampment.<br1>
With remarkable courage, they killed theBreka Orc Overlords one by one.<br1>
Thanks to this effort the Breka Orcswere driven back into the north part of Giran.<br1>
The final battle to drivethem entirely out of Giran was the fiercest yet.<br1>
The lone survivor ofthat battle was Leon's servant.<br1>
He barely escaped with a shield andweapons inscribed with his master's crest.<br1>
According to him, Athebaldtfought valiantly to the death, slaying Orcs to his left and right.<br1>
Eventually he was no match for the hundreds of Orcs that continued toattack in waves against him.<br1>
His remains have not been found.<br1>
I'm surethe Breka Orcs have taken them for some nefarious purpose.<br1>
It saddens medeeply that he cannot be given a proper burial.<br1>
