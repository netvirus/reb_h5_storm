Well done! I thank you in the name of the church ofEinhasad.<br1>
Sir Athebaldt will at last be at peace in the arms ofEinhasad.<br1>
The peace that we now enjoy would not have been possiblewithout sacrifices such as this.<br1>
Great things are achieved only at greatcost.<br1>
Sometimes a painful sacrifice must be made for the greater good.<br1>
I have written a letter commending your efforts.<br1>
Take this to *GrandMaster Hannavalt*.<br1>
