So the unfortunate knight was not able to recoverhis honor.<br1>
Was this tear of return the only thing that remained? What adreadful curse! So it is his fate to wander the Wastelands forever.<br1>
Hehas no one to blame but himself.<br1>
Well done! You have completed the tasksuccessfully.<br1>
But the task does not end with this.<br1>
Go to the *Dark ElfGuild in the Town of Dion* and meet *Sir Kiel Nighthawk*.<br1>
He will bewaiting for you with your second task.<br1>
I pray to Einhasad that youfinish all your tasks successfully and get your "wish".<br1>
