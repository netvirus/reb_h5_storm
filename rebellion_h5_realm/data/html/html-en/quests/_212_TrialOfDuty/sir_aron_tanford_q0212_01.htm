*Dignity* is one of the virtues that define aKnight's worth.<br1>
Dignity takes various forms in different people.<br1>
As wespeak there are vicious gangs, who know nothing of dignity, prowling theWastelands disturbing the residents.<br1>
These gangs are led by *Herod*.<br1>
Hewas once a prestigious Knight of Gludio.<br1>
During the war against Gracia,Herod was tempted to treason by the enemy's leader.<br1>
He became an agentof the invaders! Sir Klaus Vasper chased him doggedly and eventually puta spear through his heart.<br1>
Karol said that 'A Knight who abandons hisdignity is as good as dead.<br1>
' Not wanting to give the traitor the dignityof a funeral, his corpse was left to rot in the Wastelands.<br1>
This madehis soul become a cursed devil, and the only way to get rid of him is tofree him from the curse with this rusty sword.<br1>
*The skeleton raiderswandering around the Wastelands* are his minions.<br1>
As you destroy thefilthy skeleton raiders one by one, you will confront the *Spirit ofHerod*.<br1>
Kill him with the rusty sword I gave you, and remind him of thenoble dignity of a Gludio Knight.<br1>
If possible, please bring proof of hisend.<br1>
