May the blessings of the starlight shine upon you.<br1>
Hello, young warrior.<br1>
Welcome to the Hunters Village.<br1>
True toHannavalt's words, you seem to have the potential to become a greatKnight someday.<br1>
Let's briefly discuss the last virtue of a Knight,loyalty.<br1>
Loyalty may be towards a lord, towards the teachings of thedivine powers, or to a town and its residents whom you've sworn toprotect.<br1>
A good example would be the guards that risked their lives tobattle the Leto Lizardmen and protect this village.<br1>
The loyalty theydisplayed in sacrificing their lives to protect their homes and lovedones is surely honorable indeed.<br1>
My task for you is to recover the*milita's article* from the *Leto Lizardmen.<br1>
* The families of the fallenguards wish to hold a memorial for them.<br1>
Considering their sacrifice,should we not at least do this much for them? In order to hold thememorial, we need *20 pieces of the articles.<br1>
* Well then, good luck onyour journey.<br1>
Leto Lizardmen can be found on the Plains of theLizardmen.<br1>
