The report.<br1>
Must get to the King! Please.<br1>
please, could you deliver it to the King of Aden.<br1>
Young Warrior.<br1>
hear my confession.<br1>
The depth of my sin is deeper than you canimagine.<br1>
Until my wrongs are righted, and justice prevails in thisland of Dion, I shall not rest in peace.<br1>
I do not dare to.<br1>
