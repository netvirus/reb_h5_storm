We really don't know what you will encounter when youopen the gateway to Pailaka.<br1>
But as with Kamaloka, I suspect you willfind an ally there willing to share information.<br1>
You should have nodifficulty learning what you must do.<br1>
Of course, you don't know whatkind of weapons to take with you.<br1>
