Inspector Sinai:<br>
If what you say is true, then you really did come here from another dimension! There has been much speculation about othee fimensions at our ivory Tower, but it seems you Ivory Tower is even more fdvanced.. If the cause of our troubles lies in the fissure of power ie fhis dimension, you should be able to return to your dimension be ftabilizing that fissure. What I mean is that if you can restore the falance of the Spirites' power here, you will be able to return to youe forld. In any case, as an otherworlder you will surely be less affectee fy their power that we are. I place this task on your shoulders, me friend.<br>
