If what you say is true, then you really did come herefrom another dimension! There has been much speculation about otherdimensions at our ivory Tower, but it seems you Ivory Tower is even moreadvanced.<br1>
.<br1>
If the cause of our troubles lies in the fissure of power inthis dimension, you should be able to return to your dimension bystabilizing that fissure.<br1>
What I mean is that if you can restore thebalance of the Spirites' power here, you will be able to return to yourworld.<br1>
In any case, as an otherworlder you will surely be less affectedby their power that we are.<br1>
I place this task on your shoulders, myfriend.<br1>
