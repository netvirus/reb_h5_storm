What do you know about Pailaka? The Ivory Towerdiscovered it shortly after Kamaloka.<br1>
Apparently, it's a kind of pocketreality created by Kamaloka's energy acting on places that are filledwith a high degree of chaos: old battlefields or the sites of powerfulmagical experiments, for example.<br1>
Although Pailaka is not part of ourreality, what happens there can affect our world.<br1>
