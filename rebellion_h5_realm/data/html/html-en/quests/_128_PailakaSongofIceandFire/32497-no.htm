Ah, you are the adventurer I spoke to before! Thanksto your efforts, the strange omens we feared seem to have disappeared.<br1>
But I worry that Pailaka may be different from Kamaloka.<br1>
True, it hasnot shown any signs of reappearing.<br1>
But I suspect this is not onlyPailaka out there; perhaps in your adventures you will encounter anotherPailaka somewhere else.<br1>
