We inspectors were sent by the Ivory Tower to findmore about that place.<br1>
We followed the flow of mana and traced theenergy of Kamaloka to find likely spots.<br1>
At present, Pailaka has notaffcted our reality, but who knows what may happen in time? It may evenimpact next year's harvest.<br1>
We discovered Pailaka in the ForgottenTemple close to here.<br1>
If you are willing, I would like you to enterPailaka and restore order.<br1>
Will you do it? *(You will be rewarded foryour efforts.<br1>
Vitality points will be granted to you immediately uponcompleting the quest.<br1>
