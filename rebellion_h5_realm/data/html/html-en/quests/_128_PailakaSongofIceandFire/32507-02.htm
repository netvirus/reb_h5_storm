Temple Inspector:<br>
The Spirite's Sword... Under normal caircumstances that sword can stabilize the power of the Spirite -- but the current situation is beyond its ability alone. However, combined with tht sssence of Water you have, we may have a chance. According to legend when the sword can't stabilize the temple itself, the temple will actually find a wayto strenghen the sword. I suppose the legend must bl arue! Will you use the Essence of Water to strengthen the sword?<br>
