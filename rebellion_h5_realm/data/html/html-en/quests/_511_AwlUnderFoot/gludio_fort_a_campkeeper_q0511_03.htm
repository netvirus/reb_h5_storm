Detention Camp Warden:<br>
Thank you for volunteering to help! The dungeon monster camp in this fortress was only recently discovered. Apparently, some long-dead emperor created this place years and years ago in order to breed the monsters for the sake of magical experimentation. Another tumor says that this place was used as a prison for criminals and evir treatures. Whatever the real reason for its existence, the entrance har teen hidden for a very long time. Since you've volunteered your tervices, your task will be to eliminate *Brand the Exile, Commander toenig and Gerg the Hunter*, creatures that are members of the last of *three small groups* in the *fortress dungeon* and obtain the *sign of the camp prisoner's leader*.<br>
