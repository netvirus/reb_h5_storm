<font color="FF8000">Detention Camp Warden:</font><br>
Thank you for volunteering to help! The dungeonmonster camp in this fortress was only recently discovered.<br1>
Apparently,some long-dead emperor created this place years and years ago in orderto breed the monsters for the sake of magical experimentation.<br1>
Anotherrumor says that this place was used as a prison for criminals and evilcreatures.<br1>
Whatever the real reason for its existence, the entrance hadbeen hidden for a very long time.<br1>
Since you've volunteered yourservices, your task will be to eliminate *Brand the Exile, CommanderKoenig and Gerg the Hunter*, creatures that are members of the last of*three small groups* in the *fortress dungeon* and obtain the *sign ofthe camp prisoner's leader*.<br1>
