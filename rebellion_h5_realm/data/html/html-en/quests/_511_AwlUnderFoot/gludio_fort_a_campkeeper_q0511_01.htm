<font color="FF8000">Detention Camp Warden:</font><br>
I am the Detention Camp Warden of this fortress.<br1>
This underground monster camp was recently discovered.<br1>
I know that otherfortresses also have camps like this.<br1>
My duty is to keep this dungeoncamp area safe.<br1>
After all, it would hardly be desirable to have monstersappearing and disappearing in the dungeon of a fortress, would it?Unfortunately, we simply can't handle this job alone.<br1>
We need help fromthe clan members.<br1>
We'll compensate you for your help, naturally.<br1>
