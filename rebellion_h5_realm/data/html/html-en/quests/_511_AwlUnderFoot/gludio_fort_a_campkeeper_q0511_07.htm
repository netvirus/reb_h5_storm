<font color="36DC25">Detention Camp Warden:</font><br>
Once there was a major fight between the evilbeings and the keepers of this dungeon camp.<br1>
What a battle.<br1>
Both sidessuffered enormous casualties.<br1>
But at least the conflict seems to havekept many of the lower level monsters in check.<br1>
However, the strongestof the creatures have formed 3 groups and are regularly maraudingthrough the camp.<br1>
Judging from their recent activity, they're planningsomething, that's for sure.<br1>
Your task will be to eliminate the *3groups* so that the remaining evil creatures in the camp can be drivenout.<br1>
Kill the General Monster of the *last group*, and bring back the*Camp Prisoner Leader's Sign*.<br1>
In return, I'll give you the Knight'sEpaulette, which you can exchange for the fortress clan supply.<br1>
Oh, onelast thing: the prisoner leaders we've identified so far are *Brand theExile, General Koenig and Gerg the Hunter*.<br1>
I can admit you to thedungeon of the fortress right now.<br1>
