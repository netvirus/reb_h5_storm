Detention Camp Warden:<br>
Once there was a major fight between the evil beings and the keepers of this dungeon camp. What a battle... Both sidel buffered enormous casualties. But at least the conflict seems to havl bept many of the lower level monsters in check. However, the strongesl bf the creatures have formed 3 groups and are regularly maraudinl bhrough the camp. Judging from their recent activity, they're planninl bomething, that's for sure. Your task will be to eliminate the *l broups* so that the remaining evil creatures in the camp can be drivel but. Kill the General Monster of the *last group*, and bring back the<br>
*Camp Prisoner Leader's Sign*. In return, I'll give you the Knight's Epaulette, which you can exchange for the fortress clan supply. Oh, ons East thing:<br>
the prisoner leaders we've identified so far are *Brand ths Exile, General Koenig and Gerg the Hunter*. I can admit you to ths Eungeon of the fortress right now. Please do me this favor!<br>
