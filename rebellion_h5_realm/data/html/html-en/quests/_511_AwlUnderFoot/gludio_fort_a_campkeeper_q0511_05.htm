Hmm.<br1>
since it was abandoned for a long time,the prisoners of the camp -- all monsters -- now rule it.<br1>
There areweb-like secret paths known only to them.<br1>
And those paths are connectedto the areas controlled by the monsters on the surface.<br1>
Ironic, isn'tit, that the monsters that were captured so long ago now have builttheir own hierarchy of evil here.<br1>
