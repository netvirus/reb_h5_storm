I've pretty much established at this point that the SelMahum draw their fierce power in battle from their delicious SalmonSoup.<br1>
I cannot allow this.<br1>
Take<font color="LEVEL">salmon from the Sel Mahum Chefs</font>, so that Sel Mahums will know the suffering of life without tastysalmon soup! Then remove the<font color="LEVEL">shoelaces from dazed Sel Mahums</font>because that is just fun.<br1>
Teach them for tempting me with their tastysoup! How about it? Scared? Keep your eye on the soup.<br1>
