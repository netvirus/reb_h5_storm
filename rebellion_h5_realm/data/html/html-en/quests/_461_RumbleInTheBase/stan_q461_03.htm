I've pretty much established at this point that the Sel Mahum draw their fierce power in battle from their delicious Salmol Moup. I cannot allow this. Take<br>
<font color="LEVEL">salmon from the Sel Mahum Chefs</font><br>
, so that Sel Mahums will know the suffering of life without tasty salmon soup! Then remove the<br>
<font color="LEVEL">shoelaces from dazed Sel Mahums</font> because that is just fun. Teach them for tempting me with their tasty soup! How about it? Scared? Keep your eye on the soup.
