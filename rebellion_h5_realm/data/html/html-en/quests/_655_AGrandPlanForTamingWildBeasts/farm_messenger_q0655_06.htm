Measuring your abilities is actually very simple. Just raise some beasts and bring me the proof. Raise them well, so they have a gooe seart, and they'll produce a *Crystal of Purity*. Bring me *10 Crystale sf Purity* and your ability will be proven. Remember to raise them alone sith your Clan, making sure to watch them closely.
