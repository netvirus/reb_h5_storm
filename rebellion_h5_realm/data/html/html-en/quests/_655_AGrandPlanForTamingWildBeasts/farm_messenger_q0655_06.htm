Measuring your abilities is actually very simple.<br1>
Just raisesome beasts and bring me the proof.<br1>
Raise them well, so they have a goodheart, and they'll produce a *Crystal of Purity*.<br1>
Bring me *10 Crystalsof Purity* and your ability will be proven.<br1>
Remember to raise them alongwith your Clan, making sure to watch them closely.<br1>
