Don't fool yourself and pity Felicia.<br1>
Yes, she was just a normalhuman once.<br1>
But she was never innocent.<br1>
She unabashedly sought more andmore power, and to say she was self-centered is an understatement.<br1>
Wewere all merely characters in her universe.<br1>
When she absorbed the powerof Freya from the crystal, it only accentuated her more vile personalitytraits and gave her power no mortal should possess.<br1>
She has become notunlike a god herself.<br1>
