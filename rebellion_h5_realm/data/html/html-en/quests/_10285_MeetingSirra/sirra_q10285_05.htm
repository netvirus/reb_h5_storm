It's our castle and you'll need the help of those within todefeat her.<br1>
We were all caught up in Freya's destructive web: not justthe knights, soldiers, and nobles but also the butlers, servants, andcooks.<br1>
Even myself, the Grand Head Chamberlain.<br1>
While we cannot defyFreya's will, we know she poses a dire threat to the world and we maystill be able to help.<br1>
I assure you that you will need it.<br1>
