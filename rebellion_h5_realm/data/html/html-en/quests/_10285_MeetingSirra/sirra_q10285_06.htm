We can isolate Freya's essence and seal it in what is called afrozen core, a device not unlike the ice crystal that began this wholething.<br1>
It so happens I am capable of making this device! I assure you,it is not because I am fabulous, though I am.<br1>
It is part of the curseFreya placed on me.<br1>
She believes her power over her consorts so greatthat I would never move against her, and in a way it is true.<br1>
But I cangive you this, and my curse will become your gift.<br1>
