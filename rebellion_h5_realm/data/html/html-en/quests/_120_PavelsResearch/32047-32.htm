I have no more to say to you.<br1>
Please tell the Dwarf what I said.<br1>
There is no more danger here; you have resolved all of the problems.<br1>
Iam being operated by a Starstone, but once that Starstone disappears, Iwill begin to be deactivated.<br1>
I am looking forward to it Â— I want torest, at long last.<br1>
Please take this.<br1>
It is all I have left to give.<br1>
