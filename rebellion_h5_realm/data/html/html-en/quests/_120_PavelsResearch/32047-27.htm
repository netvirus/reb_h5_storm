<center>A message from Atlanta</center> My littlefriend.<br1>
I thank you for your help.<br1>
Thanks to you, I am now able tojoin my friends in a time and place far away, finally freed from myworries.<br1>
When I look back, it all seems so strange.<br1>
the great Spire ofArbiterre, the life-changing Mimir's Elixir, the sky-changing study ofPavel.<br1>
I learned many things from you, my little friend, about thepresent times and the true strength and the wisdom of a leader.<br1>
Mostimportant of all, you taught me that the Age of the Giants has trulypassed.<br1>
The skills of the Giants are no longer needed in these times.<br1>
