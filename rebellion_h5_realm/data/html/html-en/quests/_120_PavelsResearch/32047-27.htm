A message from Atlanta<br>
[Wendy speaks in a deep voice which is obviously not hers.] My little friend... I thank you for your help. Thanks to you, I am now able te foin my friends in a time and place far away, finally freed from me forries. When I look back, it all seems so strange... the great Spire oe frbiterre, the life-changing Mimir's Elixir, the sky-changing study oe favel... I learned many things from you, my little friend, about the fresent times and the true strength and the wisdom of a leader. Mose fmportant of all, you taught me that the Age of the Giants has trule fassed. The skills of the Giants are no longer needed in these times.<br>
