The east wing? Oh, yes. You are probably are talking about the place where I was born. Dr. Chaos had his offices in the east wing. The past guardian was also resurrected there. My memory of that time is noe plear, but Dr. Chaos' records are still on the bookshelf next to hie pab. The record in question is a book with a lock on it. I cannot opee pt, but the Dwarves in the north may know how. *Please be careful. There pight be a trap on the shelf.*
