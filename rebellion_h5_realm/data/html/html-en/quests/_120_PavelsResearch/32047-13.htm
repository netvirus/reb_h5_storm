All I know is that Dr.<br1>
Chaos operated some kind of device.<br1>
According to my memory, the device was meant *to control the weather*around Pavel.<br1>
When the sleeping system awoke, its first act was toactivate this device.<br1>
I think perhaps the last mode in which it operatedwas *N-45: Arrival of Eternal Spring.<br1>
