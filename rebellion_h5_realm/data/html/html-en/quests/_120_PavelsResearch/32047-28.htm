<center>A message from Atlanta</center>Lastly, I thank you for preventing the disaster.<br1>
I assume Doctor Pavelis also grateful to you.<br1>

If adventurers such as yourselves combine yourefforts, you will be strong enough to fight against even more formidableenemies, like the Children of Shilen.<br1>
