I believe that all these events are related! The explosion,Wendy and the Guardian Golems waking up.<br1>
It can mean nothing else.<br1>
The Weathermaster has been activated! Now, the explosion happened in thenorth wing of the building.<br1>
It seems obvious that something wasoperated in the east wing and west wing as well.<br1>
But the stupid Dwarfwho resurrected Wendy didn't have the slightest idea of how to operatethe Weathermaster, he just turned it on! Someone must put a stop tothis, or.<br1>
