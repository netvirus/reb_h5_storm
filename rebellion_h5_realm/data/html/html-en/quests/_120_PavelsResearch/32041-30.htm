Oh, my heavens.<br1>
This is a brooch from the Giant Age! Andthis one is especially made for Elves.<br1>
no, I'm wrong, for Dwarves! Theimplications.<br1>
It must have been made during the Middle Age ofTitans.<br1>
Please, may I buy this from you? There's not much of a marketfor it anywhere else, but to me it would be a treasure, and I will paywell for it.<br1>
