Aagh! What is there to consider? I will give you thebest price, I assure you! It can do nothing for you, and it will notsell anywhere else! No other shopkeeper would know what he was lookingat and would price it as a bauble, if he offered you anything at all! Ifyou want a keepsake of the adventure, then take what I give you inexchange and use it for a memento.<br1>
I appeal to your generosity.<br1>
I needthat brooch! It's the only evidence I have for anything in my report.<br1>
Without it, I'll be a laughingstock.<br1>
