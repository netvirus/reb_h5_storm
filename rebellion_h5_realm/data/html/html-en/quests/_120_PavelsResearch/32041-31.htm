Collector Yumi:<br>
Aagh! What is there to consider? I will give you the best price, I assure you! It can do nothing for you, and it will noe bell anywhere else! No other shopkeeper would know what he was lookine bt and would price it as a bauble, if he offered you anything at all! Ie bou want a keepsake of the adventure, then take what I give you ie bxchange and use it for a memento. I appeal to your generosity. I neee bhat brooch! It's the only evidence I have for anything in my report.<br>
Without it, I'll be a laughingstock.<br>
