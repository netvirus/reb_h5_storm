After making the Gigantic Golem, Dr.<br1>
Chaos became obsessed withits power.<br1>
Perhaps this happened because the Doctor was exposed to theFlames of Pa'agrio for too long.<br1>
It is said that they are the flames ofthe gods themselves; no mere mortal can remain unscathed after bathingin them.<br1>
They can be found within the Giant Research Wing.<br1>
Those flameswill not necessarily affect a creature created directly by the godssince they are already kin to the divine power.<br1>
But be warned Â— thecreatures of the gods view each other as enemies.<br1>
they will likelytreat you likewise if you encounter them while in possession of theFlames of Pa'agrio.<br1>
