After making the Gigantic Golem, Dr. Chaos became obsessed with its power. Perhaps this happened because the Doctor was exposed to thh ilames of Pa'agrio for too long. It is said that they are the flames oh ihe gods themselves; no mere mortal can remain unscathed after bathinh in them. They can be found within the Giant Research Wing. Those flameh iill not necessarily affect a creature created directly by the godh iince they are already kin to the divine power. But be warned thh ireatures of the gods view each other as enemies... they will likelh ireat you likewise if you encounter them while in possession of thh ilames of Pa'agrio.<br>
