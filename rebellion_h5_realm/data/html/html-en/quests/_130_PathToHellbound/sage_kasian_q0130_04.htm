Did you also feel the wave of magic emanate fromHellbound a few days ago? Hmm, given your power level, it-s odd that youdidn't feel it.<br1>
I have conducting my own investigation recently.<br1>
Idiscovered the path to Hellbound has been opened.<br1>
Fortunately it is notdue to Beleth awakening.<br1>
I believe it is rather the strength of theWitch that has broken the barrier.<br1>
If you wish to go to Hellbound, Ithink you should go find the Witch.<br1>
