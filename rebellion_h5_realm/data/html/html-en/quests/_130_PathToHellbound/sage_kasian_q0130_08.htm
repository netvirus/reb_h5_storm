A *Blue Crystal.<br1>
* You ask for the gift i received fromthe Water Dragon itself when i was young.<br1>
It is very precious to me.<br1>
Tell me, did you think I would simply hand it over to you? Hmmph! Butsince *Galate* asked you to retrieve this not simply to test you, butbecause she actually needs it.<br1>
Very well, take this to her.<br1>
I hopethis is the last time our paths cross.<br1>
