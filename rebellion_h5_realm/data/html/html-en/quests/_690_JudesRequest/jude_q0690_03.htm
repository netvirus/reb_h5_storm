Bear in mind that what I'm looking for are not run-of-the-millweapons carried by common monsters within the Steel Citadel.<br1>
No, I needweapons from the Lesser Evils and Greater Evils that are found in*Monster Foundry*.<br1>
Other Evil Weapons are useless! Understand? Bring me*200 Evil Weapons* and I'll give you the *S80 Grade weapon recipe* inexchange.<br1>
Or I can give you *3 S80 Grade weapon pieces* for every *5Evil Weapons* you bring me.<br1>
