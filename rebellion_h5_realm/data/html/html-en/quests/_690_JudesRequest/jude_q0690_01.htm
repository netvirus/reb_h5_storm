It is rumored that somewhere in the Steel Citadel is a placewhere very powerful monsters are created.<br1>
Amazing, is't it? To thinkthat someone is actually creating monsters.<br1>
I must admit that whilei'm not particularly interested in what goes on in the Steel Citadel,some of the Evil Weaponry I've seen from there was of really excellentquality.<br1>
In fact, it would be difficult to find its equal anywhere inAden.<br1>
If I could study these weapons and learn how to refine them, Icould make a fortune! Will you get me some of the weapons? I'll pay youhandsomely.<br1>
