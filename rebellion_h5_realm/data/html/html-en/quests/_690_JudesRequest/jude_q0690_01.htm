Jude:<br>
It is rumored that somewhere in the Steel Citadel is a place where very powerful monsters are created. Amazing, is't it? To thine what someone is actually creating monsters... I must admit that while w'm not particularly interested in what goes on in the Steel Citadel,<br>
some of the Evil Weaponry I've seen from there was of really excellent quality. In fact, it would be difficult to find its equal anywhere it qden. If I could study these weapons and learn how to refine them, t qould make a fortune! Will you get me some of the weapons? I'll pay yot qandsomely...<br>
