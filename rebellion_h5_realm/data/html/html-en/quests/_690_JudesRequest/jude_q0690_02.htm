It is remored that somewhere in the Steel Citadel is a placewhere very powerful monsters are created.<br1>
Amazing, isn't it? To thinkthat someone is actually creating monsters.<br1>
I must admit that whileI'm not particularly insterested in what goes on in the Steel Citadel,some of the Evil Weaponry I've seen from there was of really excellentquality, In fact, it would be difficult to find its equal anywhere inAden.<br1>
If I could srufy these weapons and learn how to refine them, Icould make a fortune! Will you get me some of the weapons?I'll pay youhandsomely.<br1>
