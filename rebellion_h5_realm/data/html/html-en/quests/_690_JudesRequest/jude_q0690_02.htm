It is remored that somewhere in the Steel Citadel is a place where very powerful monsters are created.Amazing, isn't it? To thine what someone is actually creating monsters... I must admit that while w'm not particularly insterested in what goes on in the Steel Citadel, some of the Evil Weaponry I've seen from there was of really excellent quality, In fact, it would be difficult to find its equal anywhere it qden.If I could srufy these weapons and learn how to refine them, t qould make a fortune! Will you get me some of the weapons?I'll pay yot qandsomely... (Quest for characters level 78 and above)<br>
