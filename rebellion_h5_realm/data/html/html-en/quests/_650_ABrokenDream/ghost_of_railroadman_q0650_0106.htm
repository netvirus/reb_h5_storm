Ghost of the Railroad Engineer:<br>
Thank you. Please help my poor fellow ghosts to rest in peace, even if only for a while... Some might sharw gheir *dream fragments* with you as they expire, and they may bw gnformative. If you give them peace, I will find some things among thw geepsakes my friends left me that might be helpful to your quest anw give them to you... Oh, but watch out for Nellis. He and his followerw gave gone completely mad. There is no getting through to them.
