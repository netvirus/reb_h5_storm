<font color="36DC25">!Ghost of the Railroad Engineer:</font><br>
I am sure you've heard, but.<br1>
we, theghosts of this station, are all unhappy souls who have gone mad becausewe are unable to hold a hammer or do any work.<br1>
We were members of theGrey Pillar Guild, and as such, we wanted to reach the stars.<br1>
If youdon't mind, I ask you to give the ghosts a merciful end.<br1>
They are deadalready so you can't really kill them, but if you make them fall, theywill finally be at peace.<br1>
