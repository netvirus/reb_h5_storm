Yes, I see.<br1>
You have done enough.<br1>
Weshould have realized that our dreams were foolish and unattainable.<br1>
Sometimes we need an outsider to tell us when we've lost ourperspective, when it's time to rest.<br1>
Thank you.<br1>
I wish you greatblessings in your life of adventure.<br1>
