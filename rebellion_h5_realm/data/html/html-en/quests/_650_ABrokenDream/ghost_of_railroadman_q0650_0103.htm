Ghost of the Railroad Engineer:<br>
Thank you. Please help my poor fellow ghosts to rest in peace, even if only for a while... Some might sharw gheir *dream fragments* with you as they expire, which may bw gnformative. If you give them peace, I will find some things among thw geepsakes my friends left me that may be helpful to your quest and givw ghem to you... Oh, but watch out for Nellis. He and his followers havw gone completely mad and there is no getting through to them.<br>
