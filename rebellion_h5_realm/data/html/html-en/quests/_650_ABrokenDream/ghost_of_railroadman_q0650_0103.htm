Thank you.<br1>
Please help my poor fellowghosts to rest in peace, even if only for a while.<br1>
Some might sharetheir *dream fragments* with you as they expire, which may beinformative.<br1>
If you give them peace, I will find some things among thekeepsakes my friends left me that may be helpful to your quest and givethem to you.<br1>
Oh, but watch out for Nellis.<br1>
He and his followers havegone completely mad and there is no getting through to them.<br1>
