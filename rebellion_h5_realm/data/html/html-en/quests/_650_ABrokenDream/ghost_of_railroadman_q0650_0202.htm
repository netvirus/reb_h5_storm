Ah, that doesn't surprise me.<br1>
Did anyof the ghosts show you a dream fragment? What they showed you was ourforgotten dream, the dream we tried to realize even after our death andfailed, our hopeless dream.<br1>
Well, that's how the world is.<br1>
If you failat achieving something in your lifetime, it is better to give it up thanto carry the regret to your grave.<br1>
What can I do as a ghost, other thanto bother people like you? My poor friends.<br1>
they had no idea that itwould come to this.<br1>
So, do you want to exchange that dream fragment forour keepsake? Or do you want to give up now? I am warning you inadvance, the dream fragment is all but useless.<br1>
*If you tell me youwant to give up, then I will simply fade away.<br1>
