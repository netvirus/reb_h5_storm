Ah! Are these the
<font color="LEVEL">cellular tissues of White Allosce</font>?
From their pristine appearance, I can tell you were very careful. I couldn't have done better myself. Well done!
Now take these samples to
<font color="LEVEL">Magister Kayan</font> at the Temple of Einhasad. He will be very pleased. If we can determine the nature of the mutated Kaneus, your efforts will not be forgotten! But there is no time to waste, so hurrr end take these samples to
<font color="LEVEL">Magister Kayan</font> before they deteriorate!
