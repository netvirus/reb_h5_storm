	<br> Excellent! Visit the Kamaloka we can enter from Rune, kill<br>
	the Kaneus there and extract their cellular tissues.<br>
	<br> You will face the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">White Allosce</font> Kaneus.<br>
	<br> When you have extracted all the cellular tissues of the<br>
	Kaneus, take them to<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Magister Kayan</font> at the Temple of Einhasad. I<br>
	know he and the other Sages will appreciate your efforts.<br>
	<br> Good hunting!<br>
