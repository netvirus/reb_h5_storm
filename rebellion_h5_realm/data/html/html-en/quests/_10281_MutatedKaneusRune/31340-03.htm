Excellent! Visit the Kamaloka we can enter from Rune, kill the Kaneus there and extract their cellular tissues. You will face the
<font color="LEVEL">White Allosce</font> Kaneus. When you have extracted all the cellular tissues of the Kaneus, take them to
<font color="LEVEL">Magister Kayan</font> at the Temple of Einhasad. I know he and the other Sages will appreciate your efforts. Good hunting!
