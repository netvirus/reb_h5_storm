I truly cannot stand novices these days! They stillsmell like milk, but they go around like great lords .<br1>
! If I were nota praetorian, I would knock down all those saucy rascals with one swingof my fist.<br1>
That might start their wits running.<br1>
Hey! Are you glaring atme, youngster? You look offended because I disregard you.<br1>
Hey, listen!If you don't want to be treated like a novice, you have no choice but toprove to me that you are an excellent fighter.<br1>
