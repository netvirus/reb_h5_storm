When a being's thought or spirit energy comestogether into the shape of a bead, we call that a Spirit Bead.<br1>
Artisanslike me need them to make good weapons.<br1>
That's why we gamble with them-- as they're worth a lot to us.<br1>
In this area, the say that you caneasily get Spirit Beads if you go to *Aden Cemetery, The AncientBattlegrounds* and *the Fields of Massacre*.<br1>
First, at *The Cemetery*,you can obtain *Spirit Beads* from undead creatures known as the*Spiteful Ghost of Ruins, Soldier of Grief, Cruel Punisher, Roving Soul,Tortured Undead* and *Wasted Soul*.<br1>
