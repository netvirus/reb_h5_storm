Oh No! You didn't find any single one of the 4 Boxes! Youfailed! A complete failure! Well, well, well.<br1>
I can just coldly kick youguys out of here.<br1>
But I'm too soft-hearted to do so.<br1>
So, I am going togive you another chance to go take the test.<br1>
However.<br1>
it's going tocost some money to make the boxes again, understand? If you pay 10,000adena, I will make the boxes again, so that you can re-take the test.<br1>
