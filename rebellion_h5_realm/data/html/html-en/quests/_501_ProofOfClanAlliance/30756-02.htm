Sir Kristof Rodemai:<br>
I like you. Even with just one glance, I can tell that you are leadership material, one who can lead a large group of followers.<br1>
However, unless you want people to whisper among themselves that you just put together some wanderers and beggars you will need to prove your clans capability by some objective way.<br1>
Hmm what would be good.<br1>
How about this?<br1>
There is a witch called Calis who lives near the Ivory Tower.<br1>
People say that she gives a test to discern a true hero.<br1>
People around me have told me that those who have passed her test are enjoying wide recognition as true heroes.<br1>
If your clan can pass the test, nobody will find fault with you any more.<br1>
What do you think?<br1>
Do you think you can do it?<br>
