I like you.<br1>
Even with just one glance, I can tellthat you are leadership material, one who can lead a large group offollowers.<br1>
However, unless you want people to whisper among themselvesthat you just put together some wanderers and beggars you will need toprove your clans capability by some objective way.<br1>
Hmm what would begood.<br1>
How about this? There is a witch called Calis who lives near theIvory Tower.<br1>
People say that she gives a test to discern a true hero.<br1>
People around me have told me that those who have passed her test areenjoying wide recognition as true heroes.<br1>
If your clan can pass thetest, nobody will find fault with you any more.<br1>
