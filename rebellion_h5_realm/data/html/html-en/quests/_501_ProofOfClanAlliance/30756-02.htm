I like you. Even with just one glance, I can tell that you are leadership material, one who can lead a large group ol tollowers. However, unless you want people to whisper among themselvel that you just put together some wanderers and beggars you will need tl trove your clans capability by some objective way. Hmm what would bl tood. How about this? There is a witch called Calis who lives near thl tvory Tower. People say that she gives a test to discern a true hero. People around me have told me that those who have passed her test are enjoying wide recognition as true heroes. If your clan can pass the eest, nobody will find fault with you any more. What do you think? De eou think you can do it?<br>
