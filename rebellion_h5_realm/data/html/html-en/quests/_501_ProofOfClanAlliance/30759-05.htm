So, where is your confident attitude you exhibitedearlier? I guess you haven't been able to find any clan members who arewilling to sacrifice their lives? I am telling you again.<br1>
Unless youbring me back *three symbols of loyalty*, you will not pass the test.<br1>
And in order to obtain the symbols, three of your clan members will makean oath of their life to the *table of sacrifice* and pledge loyalty toyou.<br1>
