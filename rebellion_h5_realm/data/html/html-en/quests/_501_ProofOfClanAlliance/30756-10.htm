What do you think of the current state of affairs?The royal authority at the center has been severely undermined to thepoint of losing its controlling power and revolts are breaking outeverywhere.<br1>
Even the evil spirits are making sinister movements.<br1>
Well, I guess its useless to talk about this with you.<br1>
However, ifyou belong to a clan, I would like to discuss this matter with your clanleader.<br1>
