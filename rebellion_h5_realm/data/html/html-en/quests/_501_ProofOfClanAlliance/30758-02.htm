Okay.<br1>
You seem to be quick-witted enough.<br1>
Now I will goahead and explain the test to you.<br1>
It is a very simple game.<br1>
You don'tneed to think of it as anything complicated.<br1>
You already know whatdrawing lots is, right? You can think of this as drawing boxes? Firstof all, I am going to summon 16 boxes by using magic.<br1>
Among these boxes,four boxes are under a special magic spell and they shout words out whenthey are broken.<br1>
What you guys have to do is to find all the boxes thatare under the magic spell and break them all so that they will shout outwords four times.<br1>
Of course, if possible, you can break all the boxes.<br1>
However, since there is a time limitation you may not have enough timeto break all the boxes.<br1>
I set up the game in such a way so that if youcannot accomplish the task within the given time, all the boxes willdisappear.<br1>
