What do you think? How do you like the taste of thepoison? What? Everything seems to be growing dark in front of your eyes?That is because death is gradually coming to you… Unless your clanmembers hurry up, we will have to add another grave here… Will they beable to find and bring back all the ingredients in time? What a sight tosee your face filled with pain Since I feel sorry for you, why don't Igive you some hints? Herb of Vanor can be obtained from *vanor Silenos*.<br1>
Herb of Harit can be obtained from *harit lizardmen*.<br1>
And, Herb of OelMahum can be obtained from *oel mahums*.<br1>
Rather than warriors, *shamans*will have the herbs, wouldn't you agree? And in order to obtain theBlood of Eva go and ask *Witch Athrea*, my younger sister about it.<br1>
Youwant to know where you should go to meet her? Well, let's see some timeago, she said she had to go to *Hardin's Academy* to meet with GrandMagus Hardin about something.<br1>
And, please bear in mind that, *when yourclan members bring back all the ingredients, it will have to be you togather them up.<br1>
Then come and see me in person.<br1>
Then I will use theingredients to make the antidote for you.<br1>
