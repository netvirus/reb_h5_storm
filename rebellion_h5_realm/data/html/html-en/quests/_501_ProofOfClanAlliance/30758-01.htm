I have the *Blood of Eva*.<br1>
However, I cannot give such aprecious potion to just anybody who asks for it.<br1>
More over, my oldersister Kalis asked me specifically.<br1>
not to give out the Blood of Evato just anyone who asks for it.<br1>
If you would like to obtain the Bloodof Eva, you have to pass the test I pose to you.<br1>
So.<br1>
