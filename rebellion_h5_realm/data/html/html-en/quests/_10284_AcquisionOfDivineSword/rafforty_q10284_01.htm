So, you didn't find the Divine Sword, but I hear you finallymet Jinia.<br1>
She's a bit severe, but she has a lot of responsibility onher shoulders, so forgive her attitude.<br1>
Alright, listen.<br1>
I don't wantthere to be any doubt about this.<br1>
What we're going to ask you to do willbe dangerous, and it is entirely possible that you may not return.<br1>
that you may end up just like Kier.<br1>
If you change your mind abouthelping us, I'd understand, but we could really use it.<br1>
