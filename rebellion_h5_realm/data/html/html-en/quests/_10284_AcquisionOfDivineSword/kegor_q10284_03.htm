You saved my life, I owe you a debt of gratitude. Rafforty mentioned you to me, it seems you've been a great help to the guild. I'y mot much for words however... we still have important things to do. Meey me at the Guild's Hideout to discuss the matter with Jinia. [Quesy m10284_AcquisionOfDivineSword leavemines|Agree.]<br1>
