Yes… that was a tragedy.<br1>
We thought Princess Felicia existedsomewhere within the Ice Queen's mind.<br1>
However, when Kier tried toconvince her to give up her power and sway her from evil, she turned himto ice.<br1>

Our mission to turn Felicia back has changed over the years - no longeris it a mission to save Felicia, but to save the world from thedestructive might of the Ice Queen by killing her once and for all.<br1>
