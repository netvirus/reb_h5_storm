For as long as I can remember, I've been driven byextraordinary dreams! After taking control of the union, I found outabout the power of ancient heroes that is now forbidden by the gods.<br1>
Iknew that I had to possess that power! But all my attempts failed.<br1>
My body ruined, I couldn't challenge the power and ended up gettingexpelled from the union by jealous rivals.<br1>
Filled withdisappointment, I fell into despair.<br1>
But then, I had an idea! Maybe Ican't do it personally, but I can certainly train and send someone on mybehalf! Using my brain rather than physical force, and overcoming manypolitical obstacles, I took control of the union! While in thatposition, I never found the competent person I needed.<br1>
When I resigned,I was promised by the president of the union that I would be suppliedwith a competent person! He seemed credible then, he wasn't soobsessed with his coins at that point.<br1>
