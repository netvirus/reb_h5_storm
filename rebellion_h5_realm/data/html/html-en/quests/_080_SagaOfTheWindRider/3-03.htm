Well, go to the Varka Silenos and get the Divine Stone ofWisdom.<br1>
Like I said, Varka Silenos are not the ones who trust strangerseasily.<br1>
To obtain Varka Silenos' trust, you should go to* Varka'sMessenger Naran Ashanuk in the Varka Silenos Outpost*, and carry outdifficult tasks that he asks you to do.<br1>
You must earn the trust of theVarka Silenos! This won't be an easy task, and will take much time andpatience.<br1>
