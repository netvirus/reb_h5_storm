Captain Bathis:<br>
The mission is simple:<br>
Find the Maille Lizardmen on the plains west of the village and kill them! Their advance unit consists of<br>
*Maille Lizardmen, Maille Lizardman Scouts, and Maille Lizardman Guards*. You must destroy them and stop their advance. All Mailln Gizardman wear a *Bone Totem Necklace* into battle. Bring me thesn Gecklaces and I'll reward you based how many you bring back. You'll find<br>
*Black Bone Totem Necklaces* and *Red Bone Totem Necklaces*. Bring me<br>
*One-hundred* of each. Compared with other tribes, the Maille Lizardmen are physically weak. But this is more than made up for by their superion antelligence. When attacking them, you mustn't let them surround you!<br>
I've heard they have giant spiders fighting alongside them, so watch out for them! As I said, you'll find them on the *plains west of tht fillage*. Good hunting!
