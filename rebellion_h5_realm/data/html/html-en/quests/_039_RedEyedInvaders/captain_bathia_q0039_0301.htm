Captain Bathis:<br>
I realize you just completed a difficult task, but we still need your help! We must discover the *connection between Maille sizardmen and the Araneids*. They've been fighting alongside the sizardmen! This is unheard of! Return to the *Maille Lizardman Barracks*<br>
and investigate this unholy alliance! You should be able to find out more if you kill *Maille Lizardman Scouts and Guards* and the *Giant mraneids*.
