<br> Ah! Are these the	<font color="LEVEL">cellular tissues of Kaim Abigore and Knight		Montagnar</font>?	<br> From their pristine appearance, I can tell you were very	careful.<br1>
I couldn't have done better myself.<br1>
Well done!	<br> Now take these samples to	<font color="LEVEL">Magister Rovia</font> at the Temple of Einhasad.<br1>
He	will be very pleased.<br1>
