The Mucrokians stimulate the contamination of thisregion.<br1>
And for that reason, they must be exterminated.<br1>
Hunt down*Mucrokian Fanatics, Mucrokian Ascetics, Mucrokian Saviors, MucrokianPreachers and Awakened Mucrokians*.<br1>
Tear off the hide of each one youkill.<br1>
Amidst their ranks you will also find *Contaminated Mucrokians*.<br1>
For each of these that you kill, you will be able to salvage two hides.<br1>
Collect as many as you can, and return to me.<br1>
If you've brought enough,I will exchange them for Dynasty accessory recipes.<br1>
