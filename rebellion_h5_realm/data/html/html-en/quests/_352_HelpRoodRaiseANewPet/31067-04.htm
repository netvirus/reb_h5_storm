<font color="36DC25">!Pet Manager Rood:</font><br>
Oh, are you serious? I had a feeling that today wasgoing to be my lucky day! Let me tell you more about lienriks.<br1>
They aremainly found in the *Field of Silence.<br1>
They are of two kinds oflienriks: the lienrik and the lienrik lad*.<br1>
One launches a remote attackwhile the other spits poison.<br1>
Be careful of the ones that spit.<br1>
Theywill get you if you get too close.<br1>
They both produce *eggs*.<br1>
Theirgender is obvious even while in egg form.<br1>
Females are quite rare andhard to find.<br1>
I am but a humble pet manager, but if you bring one to me,I'll give you a reward.<br1>
One egg doesn't guarantee success, so the moreyou can bring me, the better.<br1>
If everything works out, I might have agrown lienrik for you when we are done.<br1>
