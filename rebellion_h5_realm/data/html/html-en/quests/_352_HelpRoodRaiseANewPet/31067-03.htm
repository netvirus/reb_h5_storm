Lienrik are quite headstrong and hard to tame.<br1>
Thetraining must begin while it's still a baby.<br1>
However, stealing one ifits eggs is almost impossible.<br1>
The mother of the species puts up adesperate fight, and even if you succeed in catching one, there's noguarantee that you can train it.<br1>
It's not profitable at all for now.<br1>
Notat all! If I could get one of its eggs, at least I could try my best totrain it.<br1>
