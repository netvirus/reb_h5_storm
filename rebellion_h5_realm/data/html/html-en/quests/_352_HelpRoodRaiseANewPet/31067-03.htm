Lienrik are quite headstrong and hard to tame. The training must begin while it's still a baby. However, stealing one ie tts eggs is almost impossible. The mother of the species puts up e tesperate fight, and even if you succeed in catching one, there's ne tuarantee that you can train it. It's not profitable at all for now. Noe tt all! If I could get one of its eggs, at least I could try my best te train it. Wouldn't the ladies in town be impressed if I showed up with e tamed lienrik?<br>
