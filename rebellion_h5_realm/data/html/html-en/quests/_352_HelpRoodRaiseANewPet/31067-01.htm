Have you ever seen a lienrik? It inhabits the Fieldof Silence.<br1>
It's so cute.<br1>
you wouldn't have forgotten it! Don't youwant to catch one and take it home? Since it flies in the air, it nevergets dirty.<br1>
And its coloring is spectacular! When you stroke it, itfeels cool and moist.<br1>
A most incredibly pleasant sensation, if youknow what I mean.<br1>
Those fools who like warm and fuzzy animals don'tknow what they're missing.<br1>
The lienrik possesses true beauty anddiginity.<br1>
