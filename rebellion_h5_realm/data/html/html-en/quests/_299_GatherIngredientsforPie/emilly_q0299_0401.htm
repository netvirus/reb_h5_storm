My son Bright stands guard at the front gate.<br1>
He's not allowedto leave his post for personal reasons while he's on duty.<br1>
WHen theweather is bad like this, my knees hurt so badly I can't walk!Occasionally my son has to leave his post to chase a criminal.<br1>
Would yougo and find him? Get a fruit basket from him and bring it to me.<br1>
