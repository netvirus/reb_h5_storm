The highest quality honey can be found in the beehive, but theinsects that guard it are actually wasps! These wasps store honey in aorgan called a honey sac inside their body.<br1>
This is by far the finesthoney, but it's extremely scarce! To make a pie I'll need at least 100honey sacs! Get them by killing *wasp leaders* and *wasp workers*.<br1>
Get*100 honey sacs* and bring them to me.<br1>
