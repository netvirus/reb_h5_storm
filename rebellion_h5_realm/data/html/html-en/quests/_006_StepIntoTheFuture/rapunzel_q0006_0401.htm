Gatekeeper Roxxy:<br>
How wonderful for you!<br1>
Both Baulro and Sir Colin are such helpful people that I'm not surprised.<br1>
Here is a special Scroll of Escape capable of opening a Dimensional Door to Giran.<br1>
*Pay close attention: it can only be used once!<br1>
Use it like any other Scroll of Escape.<br1>
Here as well is the Mark of the Traveler* that Sir Colin asked be prepared for you.<br1>
When you are ready to return to Talking Island, show it to *Trader Galladucci at the luxury store in Giran* and he will help you.<br1>
I should warn you that he's a little peculiar, but he knows his business inside and out.<br1>
May your journey be filled with adventure and excitement!
