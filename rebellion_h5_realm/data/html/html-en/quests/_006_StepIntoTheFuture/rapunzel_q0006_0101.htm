I'm very fortunate to have a job that allows me totravel across the continent.<br1>
How many others can say they've seen thegrandeur of Aden Castle or visited Giran's bustling markets or watchedthe sun set over the waters of Heine? Despite my love of travel, though,I was happy to return home here to Talking Island.<br1>
at least for now.<br1>
