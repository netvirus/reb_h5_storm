Collin Windawood:<br>
Want to go to Giran, huh?<br1>
Baulo sent you?<br1>
I told him the story a while back.<br1>
You may be fresh out of school, but worldly experiences will help shape your future.<br1>
Giran is a busy place and unexpected things can happen, so stay calm and focused!<br1>
Meet *Gatekeeper Roxxy* and tell her I sent you.<br1>
Good luck!
