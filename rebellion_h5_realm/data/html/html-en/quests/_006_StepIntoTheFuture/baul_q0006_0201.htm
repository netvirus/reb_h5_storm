Hmmm... I see.<br1>
It is certainly expensive to travel to the mainland, especially to a place as far away as Giran.<br1>
But I think it would be an invaluable experience for you.<br1>
When I was about your age, I had the opportunity to spend some time abroad, and it did me a world of good.<br1>
I have an idea! *Sir Colin Windawood* is looking for young people with ambition and potential -- I think you would be ideal.<br1>
Take this *letter* to Sir Colin and tell him you are there at my recommendation.<br1>
I'm sure he will cover your travel expenses.<br1>
Sir Colin loves to explore the ancient ruins of our island, so don't expect to find him in his office.<br1>
I've heard that he's been spending a great deal of time at the *Obelisk of Victory*, so check there first.<br1>
Good luck!
