Yes, that's it.<br1>
The Energy Ore! If this works, I will beable to transform this common substance into a perfect instant energycrystal.<br1>
Thank you for your help.<br1>
If you have time, would you collectsome more materials? The energy converter device's success rate is stilllow, so I need as much Energy Ore as I can get for more tests.<br1>
