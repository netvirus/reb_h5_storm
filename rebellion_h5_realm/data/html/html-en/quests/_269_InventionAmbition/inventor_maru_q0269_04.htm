Thank you so much! That will be very helpful! Let metell you about the materials I need.<br1>
They are called *"Energy Ore"*.<br1>
Fortunately, you can easily acquire them by hunting the monsters in the*Eastern Mining Zone* to the north of the Dwarven Village.<br1>
Let's see,the monsters there are mostly *Red Eye Barbed Bats, Northern Trimden,Kerop Werewolves, Kerop Werewolf Chiefs, Northern Goblins, NorthernGoblin Leaders, Spine Golems and Enchanted Spine Golems*.<br1>
Those are themonsters you'll have to face.<br1>
Understand? Now, please gather as manyEnergy Ore as possible.<br1>
Ah! I am far too busy! Too busy! I need to hurryup and review the blueprint.<br1>
