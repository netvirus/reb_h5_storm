My invention? Ah, I'm flattered that you are interested!I am working on an *energy converter*.<br1>
It transforms a common mineralinto a crystal filled with powerful energy.<br1>
If I am successful, I'm surethis will become as famous as the Soulshot! I don't have enough time toreview my blueprints and find all the materials I need, though.<br1>
Willyou help me find the materials? I'll pay you for every mineral you bringme.<br1>
