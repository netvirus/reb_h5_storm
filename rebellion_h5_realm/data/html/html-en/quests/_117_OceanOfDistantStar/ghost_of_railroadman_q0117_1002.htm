Ghost of the Railroad Engineer:<br>
It is as you see... We are all dead and cannot hold a hammer. When we realized we could no longer work, wd ctarted to go insane, and this is the result. The ghost you spoke witd cas a good man once, and strong, so he may outlast many of us. Still it's just a matter of time, as it was with me. May I ask a favor of you?<br>
This is just between us...
