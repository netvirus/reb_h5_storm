<font color="FF8000">Ghost of the Railroad Engineer:</font><br>
It is as you see.<br1>
We are all dead andcannot hold a hammer.<br1>
When we realized we could no longer work, westarted to go insane, and this is the result.<br1>
The ghost you spoke withwas a good man once, and strong, so he may outlast many of us.<br1>
Still,it's just a matter of time, as it was with me.<br1>
May I ask a favor of you?This is just between us.<br1>
