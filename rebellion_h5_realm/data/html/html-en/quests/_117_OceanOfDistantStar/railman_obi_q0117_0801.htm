! Then.<br1>
That must be the ghost of someonewho actually worked on the Sky Train project! Our train station wasbuilt to transport the raw materials for the construction of the SkyTrain.<br1>
The project suffered from cost overruns and had to be shutdown.<br1>
Now only abandoned ruins remain.<br1>
One could say these hammerssymbolize the dreams of those ancient Dwarves.<br1>
I don't belive in ghostsbut I'll bet this hammer meant a lot to him! I'll tell Abey what we'velearned.<br1>
Take the hammer and give it to the *ghost* next time you seehim.<br1>
