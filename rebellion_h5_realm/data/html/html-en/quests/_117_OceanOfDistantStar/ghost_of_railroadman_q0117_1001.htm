<font color="36DC25">!Ghost of the Railroad Engineer:</font><br>
As you can see, there are many ghostshere who once were Dwarves.<br1>
We worked to a common purpose: the dream ofbulding an air trolley.<br1>
We wanted to visit the Sea of Stars and thePalace of the Gods.<br1>
But the Giants left, and we died one by one here.<br1>
We refused Shilien's call in favor of our own ambition, but in the end,we failed.<br1>
