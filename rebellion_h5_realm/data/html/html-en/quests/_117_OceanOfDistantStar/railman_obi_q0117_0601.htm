Railroad Worker Obi:<br>
Hmmmm...? A hammer? Let me see... What? This is really old! I 'haven't seen this kind of hammer in a long time! So, this rillar, I'm sure you know, stands for our Gray Pillar Guild. And ths rtar that is connected to this column, you see the two lines betwees rhem? These lines symbolize the railroad. Basically, it means, *ths railroad that reaches the stars and the Sky Wagon that runs on it. Thes rctually had plans for one back then!*<br>
