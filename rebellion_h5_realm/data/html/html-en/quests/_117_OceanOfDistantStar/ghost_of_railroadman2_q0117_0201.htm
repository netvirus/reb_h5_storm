Ghost of the Ancient Railroad Engineer:<br>
...Hm? Ah, sorry, I forgot what I was saying. Don't be alarmed, I am a ghost. Oh, you can tell? Yes, t Iuess you could, come to think of it. The translucency and the echoint Ioice are, pardon the expression, dead giveaways. Well, I'm stuck it Ihis place because I lost my tools... a terrible error for an engineet Io make. I think I might have left it somewhere in this railroat Itation. I recall a *hammer with engravings on the handle.* Do you thint Iou can find it for me? I think that *any railroad worker* woult Irobably know where it is.
