.<br1>
Hm? Ah, sorry, I forgot whatI was saying.<br1>
Don't be alarmed, I am a ghost.<br1>
Oh, you can tell? Yes, Iguess you could, come to think of it.<br1>
The translucency and the echoingvoice are, pardon the expression, dead giveaways.<br1>
Well, I'm stuck inthis place because I lost my tools.<br1>
a terrible error for an engineerto make.<br1>
I think I might have left it somewhere in this railroadstation.<br1>
I recall a *hammer with engravings on the handle.<br1>
* Do you thinkyou can find it for me? I think that *any railroad worker* wouldprobably know where it is.<br1>
