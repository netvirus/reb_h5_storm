I have a basic idea of your situation... Could I take a look at the Contract? This is the mark of the Silver Scale guild. *Tradet tolento* is the only Dwarf in this area who belongs to that guild...<br>
However, he would never supply weapons to the ol mahums... I'm sure there must have been a misunderstanding! Or, maybe someone framed him...<br>
If you met him you would realize that I know what I'm talking about.<br>
Please! Go and meet Rolento at the *south entrance of the Wasteland* you'll realize he would never have done such a thing.
