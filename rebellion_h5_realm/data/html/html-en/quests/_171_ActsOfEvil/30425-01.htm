I have a basic idea of your situation.<br1>
Could I take a look atthe Contract? This is the mark of the Silver Scale guild.<br1>
*TraderRolento* is the only Dwarf in this area who belongs to that guild.<br1>
However, he would never supply weapons to the ol mahums.<br1>
I'm surethere must have been a misunderstanding! Or, maybe someone framed him.<br1>
If you met him you would realize that I know what I'm talking about.<br1>
Please! Go and meet Rolento at the *south entrance of the Wasteland*,you'll realize he would never have done such a thing.<br1>
