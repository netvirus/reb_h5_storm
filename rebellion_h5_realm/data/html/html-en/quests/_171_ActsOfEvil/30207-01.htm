Are you a mercenary sent by the guards? I suppose youknow about my situation? *20 sword blade molds* that were to bedelivered to the Dark Elves were stolen by orcs.<br1>
Dark Elves are verystrict about such things.<br1>
If they don't receive their order on time,they might sever our business relationship.<br1>
If that happens, we stand tolose vast amounts of adena.<br1>
Please help us! *Recover the cargo stolenby the Turek orcs and deliver it to Dark Elven Trader Tyra*.<br1>
You willfind her in her store in the western part of the Altar of Rites.<br1>
