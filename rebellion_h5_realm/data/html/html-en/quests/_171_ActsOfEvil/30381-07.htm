A Contract? What's this? Hmmm, a Contract to purchase alarge supplies of weapons.<br1>
Look at this seal at the bottom! The mark ofa Dwarven Guild! Could this be the proof we need that Dwarves areproviding ol mahums with weapons? We must find out which guild uses thisseal, but we can't ask the Dwarves directly.<br1>
Have you met *Neti*, wholives in this village? Ask her! She used to live among the Dwarves inSchuttgart and knows their ways.<br1>
