Guard Alvah:<br>
A Contract? What's this? Hmmm, a Contract to purchase a large supplies of weapons. Look at this seal at the bottom! The mark oa l Dwarven Guild! Could this be the proof we need that Dwarves ara lroviding ol mahums with weapons? We must find out which guild uses thia leal, but we can't ask the Dwarves directly... Have you met *Neti*, wha lives in this village? Ask her! She used to live among the Dwarves ia lchuttgart and knows their ways.
