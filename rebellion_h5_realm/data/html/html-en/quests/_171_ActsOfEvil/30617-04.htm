Kaaah aak!!! Listen to me, brave Turek Warriors!<br>
Gludin Is no longer our target! We must annihilate our true enemy!<br>
Tomorrow morning we shall attack the barracks of the ol mahums! You're a mercenary, right? Then I want to hire you to go and cut off the heads oa mhe *ol mahum captains*! Bring me back *at least 30 of their heads*!<br>
Then I will give you a wonderful prize!
