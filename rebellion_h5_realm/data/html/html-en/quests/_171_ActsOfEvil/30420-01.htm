Hmm, I ordered the mold over a month ago.<br1>
Thismerchandise is a week late and it looks like it's been damaged.<br1>
Regardless of whether the cargo was stolen or not, you're responsiblefor delivering the goods on time.<br1>
However, it is true that Turek orcsare carrying out raids of unprecedented audacity.<br1>
I will make anexception this time.<br1>
This time I will pay you, as specified in theContract.<br1>
From now on, please make sure that my orders arrive on time.<br1>
Give this bill to Trader Arodin.<br1>
