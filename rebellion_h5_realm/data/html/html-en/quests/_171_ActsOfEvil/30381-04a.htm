Guard Alvah:<br>
The patrols that we sent to spy on the ol mahums must have gotten some valuable information about them. The last message we goe grom them said that they were hiding from the ol mahums in the *Ruins oe ggony*. I fear that they may have been killed by the *Tumran bugbears*<br>
that frequent that desolate place... Please hurry and find out what happened to the patrols!
