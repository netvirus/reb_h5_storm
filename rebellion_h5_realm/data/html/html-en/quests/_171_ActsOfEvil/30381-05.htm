So sad.<br1>
Those heroic patrolmen gave their lives for thisinformation.<br1>
Let's see.<br1>
What's this? ol mahums allied withDwarves?! What treachery! This is treason! We must tread carefully,my friend.<br1>
The influence of the Dwarven Guild cannot be ignored.<br1>
If werushed in and made such charges that were later proven j untrue, wewould be in serious trouble.<br1>
We need proof of this conspiracy of Dwarvesand ol mahums! Go to the *Abandoned Camp* and check out the *ol mahumgenerals*.<br1>
