<font color="36DC25">Guard Alvah:</font><br>
We have had many problems lately from the Turek orcs.<br1>
Theworst has been their looting and pillaging! Recently a wagon crossingthe Dark Elven Forest was attacked and all the cargo stolen.<br1>
The AdenTrade Union has filed a formal request for assistance from the GludioGuards! Unfortunately, since the ol mahums are constantly trying tosneak into Gludin Village, the guards cannot leave their posts even fora moment! There has been much discussion on this subject, and we havecome to the conclusion that our only option at this point is to hiremercenaries to drive out the Turek orcs.<br1>
It is quite troubling to becompelled to trust our future to outsiders.<br1>
