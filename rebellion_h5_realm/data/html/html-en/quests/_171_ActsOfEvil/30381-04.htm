What's that? Ol mahums in the Orc Barracks? Certainlythis proves they are planning an attack! This is most distressing! .<br1>
Ifear this still won't be enough to persuade Sir Klaus Vasper.<br1>
We musttry to get more information from the patrols that were sent to spy onthe ol mahums.<br1>
They were last known to be hiding from the ol mahums inthe *Ruins of Agony*.<br1>
I fear they may have been killed by the *Tumranbugbears* that roam that desolate place.<br1>
Please find out what hasbecome of our patrols.<br1>
