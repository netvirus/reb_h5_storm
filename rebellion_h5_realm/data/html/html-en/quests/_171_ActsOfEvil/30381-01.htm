Guard Alvah:<br>
We have had many problems lately from the Turek orcs. The worst has been their looting and pillaging! Recently a wagon crossine whe Dark Elven Forest was attacked and all the cargo stolen. The Adee wrade Union has filed a formal request for assistance from the Gludie wuards! Unfortunately, since the ol mahums are constantly trying te wneak into Gludin Village, the guards cannot leave their posts even foe w moment! There has been much discussion on this subject, and we have wome to the conclusion that our only option at this point is to hire wercenaries to drive out the Turek orcs. It is quite troubling to be wompelled to trust our future to outsiders... What's that? You are e wercenary? What a stroke of luck! Would you consider helping us?<br>
