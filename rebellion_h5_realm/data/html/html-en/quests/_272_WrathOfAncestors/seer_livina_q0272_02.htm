Tejakar Oroka! Young Orc, you have been guided to me bythe spirits of our ancestors.<br1>
As you already know, since they have movedin here while we were at war against the Elves, the goblins have beendamaging the legacy of our ancestors and have been staining our sacredgrounds for hundreds of years.<br1>
Just few days ago, reckless *goblin graverobbers* dug up the great Urutu graves and committed sacrilege! Becauseof this incident, the spirits of our ancestors were furious and appearin our dreams every night, shouting for revenge in blood.<br1>
The only wayto ease their anger is to behead those disrespectful grave robbers andoffer them to the ancestors.<br1>
I order you as a seer.<br1>
