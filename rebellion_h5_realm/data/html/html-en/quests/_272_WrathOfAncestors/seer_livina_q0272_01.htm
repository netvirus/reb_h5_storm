Tejakar Oroka! Since the goblins moved here while we wereat war against the Elves, they have been damaging the legacy of ourancestors and have been staining our sacred grounds for hundreds ofyears.<br1>
Just a few days ago, reckless *goblin grave robbers* dug up ourgreat Urutu graves and dishonored us! Because of this incident, thespirits of our ancestors were furious and appear in our dreams everynight, shouting for revenge in blood.<br1>
When the next full moon rises, weplan to cut the head of those unholy grave robbers and calm the fury ofthe ancestral spirits by performing a sacrificial rite.<br1>
