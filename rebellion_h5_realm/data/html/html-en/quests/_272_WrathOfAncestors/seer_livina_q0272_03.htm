Tejakar Oroka! Young orc who fights for the dignity ofyour race, you must pacify the fury of the ancestors and renew the honorof the Orcs by killing each and every goblin that lives in this land.<br1>
But first, we must make a sacrifice for our ancestors to soothe theirspirits! To do that, we need to behead those who dug up the graves.<br1>
Tosatisfy our ancestors, we should behead at least *fifty grave robbers*.<br1>
