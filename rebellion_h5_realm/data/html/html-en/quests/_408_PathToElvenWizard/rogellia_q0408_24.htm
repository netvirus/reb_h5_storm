Oh! You have collected all the jewels! Now we can begin the ritual.<br1>
Water is the source of life.<br1>
Mother, and eternity.<br1>
Cleanse our stained souls with the tears of Eva, purer than anything in the world,and give us your new blessing.<br1>
With this, you have performed the ritual and earned the qualifications to become an Elven Wizard.<br1>
Here,take this *eternity diamond*.<br1>
If you take this to *High Priest Raymond in Gludio Castle Town*, he will change your occupation to Elven Wizard.<br1>
Of course, you can go to *High Priestess Levian in Gludin* as well.<br1>
