You have found all 5 gold leaves, I see.<br1>
In return, I will tell you about the pure aquamarine.<br1>
The Mother Tree normally does not haveany dew, but when the roots absorb the nutrition of the golden leaves,large, beautiful drops of dew form.<br1>
On rare occasions, one can find a*pure aquamarine* among the dew.<br1>
Here, take this pure aquamarine.<br1>
I pray that you may safely pass your ritual.<br1>
And do not forget.<br1>
It is our responsibility to fill the forest and the plains with joyous music.<br1>
When our songs fill the earth, the land will become a paradise.<br1>
