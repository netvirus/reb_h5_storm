Elven Wizards are in the preparatory level before becoming a Spellsinger or Elemental Summoner.<br1>
They aren't to be compared with the likes of the Dark Elves, who walk the path of evil.<br1>
To become an ElvenWizard, you must learn how to communicate with the spirits.<br1>
For this communication, you must find the four jewels that symbolize *water,fire, wind and earth* and then perform a ritual.<br1>
The ritual is performed to gain understanding of the basic elements that construct the world,and to receive Eva's blessing.<br1>
Just recently, a young one of your age came and finished the ritual.<br1>
