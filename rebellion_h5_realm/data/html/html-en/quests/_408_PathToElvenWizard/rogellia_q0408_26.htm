You have collected *five gold leaves* with no difficulty, I see.<br1>
There was a time when the Elven Forest was full of these leaves.<br1>
Now they are very rare because of the dryads.<br1>
Thalia must be waiting for these leaves, I don't want to keep her waiting.<br1>
Bring her these leaves and be quick.<br1>
