Ruby.<br1>
When I look at the red hues, I feel a memory stirring the passions of my youth.<br1>
If you seek the ruby, symbol of fire, go to *Sorceress Greenis in the Elven Village*.<br1>
I was her godmother when she was born.<br1>
She is a fine lady.<br1>
Please give her this letter I wrote about you so she will help you to find the ruby.<br1>
