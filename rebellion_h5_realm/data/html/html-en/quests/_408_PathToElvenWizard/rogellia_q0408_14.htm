Of course, you probably already know that water is the symbol of our mother Eva.<br1>
Therefore, unlike other races, we elves receive the divine protection of mother Eva in the water.<br1>
You need not go far to find the <font color="LEVEL"> Pure Aquamarine,</font> that symbolizes water.<br1>
It can be found in the Elven Forest. <font color="LEVEL">Go to Thalia who tends the Mother Tree at Lake Iris.</font><br1>
Give this fruit to her as a give, and ask her about the jewel. She will gladly help you.<br1>
You can reach Lake Iris if you go straight south of the Elven Village.<br1>
Thalia will be at the eastern shore of the lake. Well then, good luck.<br>
