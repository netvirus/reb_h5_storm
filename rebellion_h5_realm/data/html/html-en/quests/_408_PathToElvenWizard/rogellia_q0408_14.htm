Of course, you probably already know that water is the symbol of our mother Eva.<br1>
Therefore, unlike other races, we elves receive the divine protection of mother Eva in the water.<br1>
You need not go far to find the * pure aquamarine,* that symbolizes water.<br1>
It can be found in the Elven Forest.<br1>
*Go to Thalia who tends the Mother Tree at Lake Iris.<br1>
*Give this fruit to her as a give, and ask her about the jewel.<br1>
She will gladly help you.<br1>
You can reach Lake Iris if you go straight south of theElven Village.<br1>
Thalia will be at the western shore of the lake.<br1>
Well then, good luck.<br1>
