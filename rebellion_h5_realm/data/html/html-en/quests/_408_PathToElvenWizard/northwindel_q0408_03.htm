You have tremendous abilities.<br1>
I'm sorry I didn't recognize itearlier.<br1>
I thought an amateur with no skills was just depending onRosella.<br1>
I guess I was wrong.<br1>
The *nobility amethyst* can be createdby blowing the wind of life into two regular ones.<br1>
The wind of life isnothing else but the breath of Elves.<br1>
Inheriting the life force of theMother Tree, our breath contains the very primeval powers.<br1>
Now! Here isthe *Nobility Amethyst* I have just made.<br1>
Take this to *Rosella.<br1>
