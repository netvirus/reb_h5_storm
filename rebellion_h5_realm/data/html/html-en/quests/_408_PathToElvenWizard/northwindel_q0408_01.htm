Oh... Rosella must have sent it. I've been begging her for a month to lend me this book. The love story in this book is very impressive. You may criticize a man that reads Romance Novels, but... Love is a truth that does not change.
Hmm... Rosella has written a letter on the first page. She asks me to tell you about the <font color="LEVEL">Nobility Amethyst.</font> Since you gave me the book I really wanted, and since Rosella has asked me, I will tell you how to find the Amethyst.
To obtain the Nobility Amethyst you need <font color="LEVEL">two regular Amethysts.</font> You can get the Amethysts by killing the <font color="LEVEL">sukar wererat leaders</font> in the Elven Underground Fortress. The Underground Fortress is dangerous... Please be careful.
I'll lend you this for good luck. It has always given me good luck. Return it when you have found the Amethyst.<br>
