Oh.<br1>
Rosella must have sent it.<br1>
I've been begging her for amonth to lend me this book.<br1>
The love story in this book is veryimpressive.<br1>
You may criticize a man that reads romance novels, but.<br1>
Love is a truth that does not change.<br1>
Hmm.<br1>
Rosella has written aletter on the first page.<br1>
She asks me to tell you about the *nobilityamethyst.<br1>
* Since you gave me the book I really wanted, and since Rosella has asked me, I will tell you how to find the amethyst.<br1>
To obtain thenobility amethyst you need *two regular amethysts.<br1>
* You can get the amethysts by killing the *sukar wererat leaders* in the ElvenUnderground Fortress.<br1>
The Underground Fortress is dangerous.<br1>
Please becareful.<br1>
I'll lend you this for good luck.<br1>
It has always given me goodluck.<br1>
Return it when you have found the amethyst.<br1>
