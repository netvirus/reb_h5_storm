Oh... a letter from my godmother! How is she? Ihaven't seen her for ages.<br1>
Hmm, I see you're searching for the MagicalPowers Ruby.<br1>
It has been the symbol of my family for 200 years; no onein all of Oren or Gludio knows it better than I do.<br1>
Rubies were oncemined throughout northern Gludio, but those sites all collapsed duringthe war with Gracia.<br1>
We have been unable to find any trace of theoriginal mines.<br1>
Fortunately, I still have a small piece of the MagicalPowers Ruby.<br1>
Precious as it is, I will give it to you in exchange for afavor.<br1>
