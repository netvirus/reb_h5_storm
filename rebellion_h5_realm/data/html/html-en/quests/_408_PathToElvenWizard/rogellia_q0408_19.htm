Give the book I gave you to Northwind.<br1>
The book is called, 'Immortal Love'... A wonderful love story... So touching... He asked for the book a long time ago.<br1>
To find the Elven Fortress, first go north of the village to the Neutral Zone, cross the bridge, and enter the Elven forest.<br1>
If you cross the bridge, you will immediately see the grand Elven Fortress.<br1>
The entrance is at the other side of the mountain.<br1>
You will be able to meet Northwind over there.<br>
