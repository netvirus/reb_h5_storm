Give the book I gave you to Norwind.<br1>
The book is called,'Immortal Love'.<br1>
A wonderful love story.<br1>
So touching.<br1>
He asked forthe book a long time ago.<br1>
To find the Elven Fortress, first go north ofthe village to the Neutral Zone, cross the bridge, and enter the Elvenforest.<br1>
If you cross the bridge, you will immediately see the grandElven Fortress.<br1>
The entrance is at the other side of the mountain.<br1>
Youwill be able to meet Norwind over there.<br1>
