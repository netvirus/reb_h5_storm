You are lacking in effort.<br1>
My sisters and I have worked for hundreds of years without a day of rest to look after the Mother Trees and gather their fruit.<br1>
Precious items require much work.<br1>
I cannot tell you about the Aquamarine until you have gathered <font color="LEVEL">5 Gold Leaves</font>.
    Elves serve Einhashad, Goddess of Light, along with our mother, Eva, and thus our magic possesses the properties of light.<br1>
It is our responsibility to fill the forest and the plains with joyous music.<br1>
This is what we ultimately seek to achieve through magic.<br1>
When our songs fill the earth, the land will become a paradise.<br>
