My request is not a difficult one.<br1>
A special fertilizer isneeded to maintain the green health of the Mother Trees that we lookafter.<br1>
This fertilizer is made from the leaves that fall from the treesin the Elven Forest.<br1>
Have you ever seen any fallen leaves in the ElvenForest? Probably not.<br1>
That is because the dryad elders collect them evenbefore the leaves have had a chance to settle on the ground.<br1>
They gatherthese leaves and turn them into *golden leaves.<br1>
* Use these golden leavesas fertilizer, and the trees of the Human world will never have to befertilized again.<br1>
Take this sap with you and slay *dryad elders* toobtain the golden leaf in its possession.<br1>
Bring back *5 golden leaves*and I will tell you the whereabouts of the aquamarine.<br1>
