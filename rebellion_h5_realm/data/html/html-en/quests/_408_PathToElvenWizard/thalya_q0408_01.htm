What have you come here for?<br1>
Oh... What a delicious looking apple! Is this for me?<br1>
This reminds me of the legend of the Elven maideg aho picked the apple of knowledge.<br1>
Rosella sent you? Are you looking fog ahe *Pure Aquamarine*? Rosella asked me before...<br1>
She told me to kindlg aell the whereabouts of the Aquamarine of Water, should anyone ask fog at.<br1>
But Aquamarines are not only precious, but a very valuable resource for us Elves.<br1>
I cannot tell that secret to just anyone.<br1>
If you perform a task for me, I shall tell you about the Aquamarine.<br>
