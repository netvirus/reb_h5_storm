What have you come here for? Oh.<br1>
What a delicious lookingapple! Is this for me? This reminds me of the legend of the Elven maidenwho picked the apple of knowledge.<br1>
Rosella sent you? Are you looking forthe *Pure Aquamarine*? Rosella asked me before.<br1>
She told me to kindlytell the whereabouts of the Aquamarine of Water, should anyone ask forit.<br1>
But aquamarines are not only precious, but a very valuable resourcefor us Elves.<br1>
I cannot tell that secret to just anyone.<br1>
If you perform atask for me, I shall tell you about the aquamarine.<br1>
