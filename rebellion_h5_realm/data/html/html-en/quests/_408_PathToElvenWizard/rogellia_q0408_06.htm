Four things are required to perform the ritual.<br1>
They are *4jewels that represent water, fire, wind and the earth.<br1>
* If you devotethe jewels to Mother Nature and perform the ritual for Eva's blessing,in return, you will be able to communicate more deeply with the spirits.<br1>
First, I give you this *fertility peridot.<br1>
* This is the token of earth,symbolizing abundance and productivity.<br1>
This is given to you, who wantsto have a deeper understanding of nature, as a gift.<br1>
Now you must findthe remaining three by yourself.<br1>
