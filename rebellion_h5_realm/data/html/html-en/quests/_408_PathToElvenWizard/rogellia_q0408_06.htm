Four things are required to perform the ritual. They are <font color="LEVEL">4 jewels that represent water, fire, wind and the earth.</font><br1>
If you devote the jewels to Mother Nature and perform the ritual for Eva's blessing, in return, you will be able to communicate more deeply with the spirits.<br1>
First, I give you this <font color="LEVEL">Fertility Peridot.</font> This is the token of earth, symbolizing abundance and productivity.<br1>
This is given to you, who wants to have a deeper understanding of nature, as a gift.<br1>
Now you must find the remaining three by yourself. Which one do you want to seek first?<br>
