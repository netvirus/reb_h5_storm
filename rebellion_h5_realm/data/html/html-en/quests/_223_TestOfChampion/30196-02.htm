<font color="FF8000">Captain Mouen:</font><br>
Ascalon was my teacher when I was young.<br1>
He used to be agood soldier, but he is too old these days, and often lets his mindastray.<br1>
In other words, age has begun to tell on him.<br1>
But to me he islike a father, and I can't oppose what he says.<br1>
Nowadays he is caught inself delusion and keeps saying that he himself is the only one who cansave the kingdom from its enemies.<br1>
That's why I worry sick about him.<br1>
