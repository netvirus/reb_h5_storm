Would you like to hear about my splendid past? When Iwas young I used to be hired as a soldier.<br1>
Back in those days I wanderedaround freely and fought against the alien army and made love withforeign women.<br1>
There were times when things seemed to be too harsh, buteven then, my blazing spirits as a Warrior never burned low.<br1>
The flamingfriendship among comrades, struggles, fierce battles, love and romance,I experienced them all.<br1>
We were true Warriors.<br1>
But I am too old now.<br1>
IfI find a talented young fellow who will succeed me, I would like toretire in peace.<br1>
Is there a righteous and talented young lad among yourfriends? If there is such person, please recommend him to me.<br1>
