Ah! Thank you so very much.<br1>
This is such a blessing, as Iwas badly needing help.<br1>
Could you do me one more favor? I must gather*antidote ingredients*.<br1>
I am concerned about the increase in the numberof soldiers poisoned by Medusa's venom, but near destruction? That's aserious exaggeration.<br1>
In order to create the antidote, I will need 3ingredients.<br1>
They are *the Harpy's Egg, Medusa Venom, and Windsus'Bile*.<br1>
There is no need to search afar for these ingredients, they areall quite common right here in Giran.<br1>
I know that there is an abundanceof harpies and windsus near the Corridor of Death.<br1>
Please gather *30each* of the ingredients.<br1>
Thank you.<br1>
