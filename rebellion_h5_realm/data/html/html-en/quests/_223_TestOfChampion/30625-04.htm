I am no longer strong enough to even lift up a simple spear.<br1>
Butmy hatred and will to seek revenge for those who killed my family isburning like mad.<br1>
I beg you.<br1>
Please seek revenge for me.<br1>
When you bringme back *100 heads of the bloody X bodyguards* then I'll be able to diein peace.<br1>
Those Ol Mahums are staying in the *northern part of Oren*.<br1>
You will be able to find their army post when you move farther northfrom the Corridor of Death of Kiran.<br1>
