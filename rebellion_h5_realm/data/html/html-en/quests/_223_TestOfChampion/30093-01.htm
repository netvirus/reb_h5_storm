I see that you are a follower of Ascalon.<br1>
Seeing a strongwarrior like you brings back memories.<br1>
Like Ascalon, I was once a memberof the Steel Rose Mercenaries.<br1>
When I was young, I studied herbology andfirst aid in the temple and used these skills to become a medic for thetroop.<br1>
Of course, occasionally I also wielded a spear and joined thebattle.<br1>
These days I am retired and run a small shop.<br1>
Ascalon stillcomes around and asks me to make medicine and antidotes for the villageguards from time to time.<br1>
