Things have not changed so much since the time I wasactive as a soldier.<br1>
Well, actually it has turned more chaotic andviolent.<br1>
The Blue Shark, the Black Lion, the Storm Blade, and the IronRose which I belonged to.<br1>
Many troops are fighting in various regionswith alien armies at the moment.<br1>
There has never been a time in historywhen the aliens were so warlike.<br1>
All the leaders from each tribe, andthe Masters, Sorcerers and Priests from many other guilds.<br1>
They areall complaining that the situation now is very unnatural.<br1>
Including theHunters' Union, all the secret agents from each and every domain arelooking behind the scenes, but for the moment we have no choice but toface the aliens and fight them in order to protect ourselves.<br1>
I wish todo something fruitful before I retire.<br1>
Although I am too weak toparticipate in the war myself, I shall teach you.<br1>
While you are takingthe test, be sure to do exactly as I tell you to do.<br1>
