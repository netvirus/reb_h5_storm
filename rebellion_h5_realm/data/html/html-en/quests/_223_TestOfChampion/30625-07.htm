You may not be able to appreciate my weak body, but theexperience and know-how which I have accumulated in the battlefieldscan't be ignored.<br1>
These days, I am teaching young soldiers how toconfront the flying corps or the strategy of arranging troops in timesof siege warfare.<br1>
I hope you keep up the good work.<br1>
And protect thepeace of this kingdom.<br1>
