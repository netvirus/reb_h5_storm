The only thing that kept me going was the revenge.<br1>
But nowthat everything is over and I look back upon my life, all that remainsis hatred and regret.<br1>
Everything seems so vain.<br1>
I thought that allthat was left to be done was to die.<br1>
But when I heard the story ofAscalon who is still fighting against the unjust according to hisbeliefs, I changed my mind and decided that I shall not just sit hereand wait for everything to happen.<br1>
