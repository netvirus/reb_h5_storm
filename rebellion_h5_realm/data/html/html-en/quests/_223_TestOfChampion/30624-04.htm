Oops! Aren't you an Orc? You look strong, sure thing.<br1>
Are you a Warrior by any chance? Or perhaps a hired soldier? You remindme of my younger days when I used to work as a hired soldier.<br1>
When Iwas young I used to be hired as a soldier.<br1>
Back in those days I wanderedaround freely and fought against the alien army and made love withforeign women.<br1>
There were times when things seemed to be too harsh, buteven then, my blazing spirits as a Warrior never burned low.<br1>
The flamingfriendship among comrades, struggles, fierce battles, love and romance,I experienced them all.<br1>
We were true Warriors.<br1>
But I am too old now.<br1>
IfI find a talented young fellow who will succeed me, I would like toretire in peace.<br1>
