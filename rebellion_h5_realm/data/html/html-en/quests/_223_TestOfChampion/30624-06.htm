Good! Then first, go and visit my old friend *Mason*.<br1>
He was a comrade of mine.<br1>
We used to fight together in the battlefieldsin part of the Iron Rose.<br1>
Although he has retired now, I am sure he isinformed more than anyone else about the invaders who are threateningthe townsmen of Dion.<br1>
Perhaps he might even pick up a spear and head offto the battlefields, stimulated by your young spirits.<br1>
I heard thatMason, the master of spears, is living happily with his family*somewhere in Southern Dion*.<br1>
If you bring this letter which has mystamp on it, he will greet you.<br1>
