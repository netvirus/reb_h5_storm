Up until this day, I wished I could tear the remaining soldiersin Grecia's army in this territory to death.<br1>
But I am afraid that I grewtoo weak to revenge them myself.<br1>
I will give you this ring that I worein my army days.<br1>
Please wear it and seek my revenge.<br1>
Kill them all, killthe *Bloody Axe* who took away the lives of my dear family.<br1>
Those OlMahums are staying in the *northern part of Oren*.<br1>
You will be able tofind their army post when you move farther north from the Corridor ofDeath of Kiran.<br1>
