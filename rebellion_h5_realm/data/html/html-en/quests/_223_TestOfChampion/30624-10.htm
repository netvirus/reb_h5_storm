Did you hear that not long ago, the guards and thesoldiers fought against the medusas in order to protect Giran? They allfought with all their might and beat off the medusas, but during thefight many soldiers were infected by the deadly poison of the medusas.<br1>
If we leave them like that they will all die very soon.<br1>
And just imaginewhat will happen if the medusas make their second attack! .<br1>
.<br1>
It isurgent that we find the cure.<br1>
Rather, an antidote to neutralize themedusa's poison.<br1>
But even the Priests do not know how to make it.<br1>
However, my old companion *Groot* will find a way.<br1>
He used to work as amedic for the Iron Rose, and we were together in the battlefields formore than 10 years.<br1>
I heard that he now owns a store in *Giran CastleTown*.<br1>
Go and help him make an antidote.<br1>
