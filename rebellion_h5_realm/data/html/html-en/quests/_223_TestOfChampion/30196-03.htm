*The road scavengers* are surely a nuisance if not 'atroop of outsiders threatening our kingdom' as my teacher said.<br1>
They areplundering near the trade routes which connects Oren and Giran and thedamage is serious enough.<br1>
Go to the *Corridor of Death* and wipe themout, for the purpose of carrying out the teacher's command as well asgetting rid of those 'pains in the ass'.<br1>
During the fight be aware ofthe possible attacks from the *road collectors*.<br1>
If you bring me *100heads * I will write a letter describing you as the hero who saved thekingdom.<br1>
I am pretty sure that your teacher will be pleased to read sucha letter.<br1>
