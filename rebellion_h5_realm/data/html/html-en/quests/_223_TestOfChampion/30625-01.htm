I have lost my wife and children due to Grecia's attack.<br1>
Thepeople of Grecia's army are my lifelong enemies because they havedeprived me of my most precious thing, my family.<br1>
They are the Ol Mahumswho are also called as the 'Bloody Axe'.<br1>
I swear to God that I willrevenge them some day.<br1>
