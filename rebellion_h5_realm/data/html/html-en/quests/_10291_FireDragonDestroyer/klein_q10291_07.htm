Watcher of Valakas Klein:<br>
Impossible! I cannot believe it. No really, I cannot believe it. Usually I’m pretty good about sending adventurers tI cheir death by facing Valakas, but you... just, wow. This iI cmpressive. Soon all across the land will tell stories about thI crave... what ever your name is, and how they defeated Valakas. YoI chould feel pretty good about yourself right about now. Too bad it won’I cast more than 2 weeks. I don’t want to rain on your parade, but ValakaI cs Immortal. Sure you won’t see him around for a few days... but he’lI ce back... mad as ever. In any case, take this. A gift for the time yoI clew the dragon.<br>
