Impossible! I cannot believe it.<br1>
No really, Icannot believe it.<br1>
Usually I’m pretty good about sending adventurers totheir death by facing Valakas, but you.<br1>
just, wow.<br1>
 This isimpressive.<br1>
 Soon all across the land will tell stories about thebrave.<br1>
what ever your name is, and how they defeated Valakas.<br1>
Youshould feel pretty good about yourself right about now.<br1>
Too bad it won’tlast more than 2 weeks.<br1>
I don’t want to rain on your parade, but Valakasis Immortal.<br1>
Sure you won’t see him around for a few days.<br1>
but he’llbe back.<br1>
mad as ever.<br1>
In any case, take this.<br1>
A gift for the time youslew the dragon.<br1>
