<font color="36DC25">!Watcher of Valakas Klein:</font><br>
Ah… so determined I see.<br1>
 Are you sure you areready to face Valakas? You may wish to reconsider.<br1>
A thought in my mind,years of being stopped by adventurers like you can do horrible things toa dragon’s spirit.<br1>
 Imagine all that pure rage combined with his newlyfound power.<br1>
one could only hope that Valakas doesn’t like to playwith his food.<br1>
You aren’t the first adventurer I’ve given this speechto.<br1>
 Last chance.<br1>
