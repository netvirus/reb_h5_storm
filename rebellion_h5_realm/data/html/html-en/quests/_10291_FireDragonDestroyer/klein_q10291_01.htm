Is it hot in here or is it just me? Guessthat is what you get when your blood is replaced with pure liquid magmafor all eternity.<br1>
By the expression on your face I can tell you arewondering about Valakas, no? Heard the rumor as of late? No? Ah… you arein for a real treat then.<br1>
It used to be Valakas was somewhat of a pushover, no challenge to any adventurer looking for sport.<br1>
Valakas hasfound a way to channel the energy of the Forge of the Gods and increasehis power.<br1>
Now many adventurers go into his lair only never to return.<br1>
