Watcher of Valakas Klein:<br>
Is it hot in here or is it just me? Guess that is what you get when your blood is replaced with pure liquid magms tor all eternity. By the expression on your face I can tell you ars tondering about Valakas, no? Heard the rumor as of late? No? Ah… you ars tn for a real treat then. It used to be Valakas was somewhat of a puss tver, no challenge to any adventurer looking for sport. Valakas has tound a way to channel the energy of the Forge of the Gods and increass tis power. Now many adventurers go into his lair only never to return.<br>
Now you tell me friend… are you ready to play with fire?<br>
