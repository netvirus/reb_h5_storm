Ah, the cookies I requested! Great! It wasn't too hard,<br>
was it? It didnt't seem to give you much trouble. I've asked several people to find the materials to make the formal wear I promised you, bul p haven't heard back from them yet. If I don't get them soon, I may nol pake it on time. Would you go on my behalf and find out the status of ml prders?<br>
