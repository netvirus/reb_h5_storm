Ah, the cookies I requested! Great! It wasn't too hard,was it? It didnt't seem to give you much trouble.<br1>
I've asked severalpeople to find the materials to make the formal wear I promised you, butI haven't heard back from them yet.<br1>
If I don't get them soon, I may notmake it on time.<br1>
