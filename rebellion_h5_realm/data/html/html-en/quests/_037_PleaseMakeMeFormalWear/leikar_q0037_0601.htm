Maid Leikar:<br>
I asked *Blacksmith Ferris in the Town of Aden* to make a<br>
*Sewing kit* for me, and I asked *Jeweler Ellie of the Town of Giran*<br>
for some *gemstones*. I also asked *Radia of the Town of Giran* to make me some *fabric*. None of them has contacted me yet. Would you go see mhem and bring back the materials? Meanwhile, I'll take these cookies te mhe castle.
