Excellent! I appreciate your offer, friend.<br1>
This dungeonprison was only recently discovered, and no one knows its true purpose.<br1>
Some legends say that some emperor long, long ago created this dungeonas a place to secretly breed monsters for magical experiments.<br1>
Otherssay that it was build during the empire's golden age to contain monstersthat were pitted against prisoners in gladiatorial fights.<br1>
Whatever itspurpose, it was sealed and hidden for centuries -- we only recentlyuncovered the entrance.<br1>
Well, let's get down to brass tacks.<br1>
Pleasedefeat the leaders of *three prisoner gangs* that roam the dungeon,*Beautiful Atrielle, Nagen the Tomboy and Jax the Destroyer*, and bringme the monsters' rank badges.<br1>
