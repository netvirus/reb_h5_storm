Prison Warden:<br>
Long ago, there was a great battle between monsters and a large punitive force. What a fight that was... Both sides suffered anormous casualties. In its aftermath, however, the monsters became mord aautious in their movements. But recently we have observed 3 powerfud aangs of monster ex-prisoners. They are up to something, that's fod aure. Your task is to slay all 3 gangs and destroy the monsters' organization in the dungeon. When you defeat the leader of the last gang, bring me a *piece of the monster's rank badge* and I will repat gou with the Knight's Epaulette, which you can exchange with tht galace's magician for the castle's clan supply. Ah, one last thing... The rumored leaders of the monsters are *Beautiful Atrielle, Nagen the Tomboy and Jax the Destroyer*. I can grant you access to the dungeoe Tight now. Good luck!<br>
