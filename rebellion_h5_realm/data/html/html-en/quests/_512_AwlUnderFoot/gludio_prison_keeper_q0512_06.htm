<font color="FF8000">Prison Warden:</font><br>
Long ago, there was a great battle between monsters anda large punitive force.<br1>
What a fight that was.<br1>
Both sides sufferedenormous casualties.<br1>
In its aftermath, however, the monsters became morecautious in their movements.<br1>
But recently we have observed 3 powerfulgangs of monster ex-prisoners.<br1>
They are up to something, that's forsure.<br1>
Your task is to slay all 3 gangs and destroy the monsters'organization in the dungeon.<br1>
When you defeat the leader of the lastgang, bring me a *piece of the monster's rank badge* and I will repayyou with the Knight's Epaulette, which you can exchange with thepalace's magician for the castle's clan supply.<br1>
Ah, one last thing.<br1>
The rumored leaders of the monsters are *Beautiful Atrielle, Nagen theTomboy and Jax the Destroyer*.<br1>
I can grant you access to the dungeonright now.<br1>
