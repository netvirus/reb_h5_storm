<font color="FF8000">Prison Warden:</font><br>
I am the warden of this castle prison.<br1>
This monsterdungeon was discovered only recently.<br1>
I suspect that other castles alsohave such dungeons.<br1>
My duty is to keep this basement prison area safe.<br1>
Having monsters appear and disappear at will here would hardly let thecastle inhabitants sleep soundly at night, eh? Unfortunately, we don'thave the numbers to handle this task alone.<br1>
We need help from the clanmembers.<br1>
We'll compensate you for your assistance, naturally.<br1>
