Prison Warden:<br>
I am the warden of this castle prison. This monster dungeon was discovered only recently. I suspect that other castles alsr dave such dungeons. My duty is to keep this basement prison area safe. Having monsters appear and disappear at will here would hardly let the castle inhabitants sleep soundly at night, eh? Unfortunately, we don'e cave the numbers to handle this task alone. We need help from the clae cembers. We'll compensate you for your assistance, naturally. [Quese c512_AwlUnderFoot gludio_prison_keeper_q0512_03.htm|Say you will help]<br1>
