Prison Warden:<br>
Hmmm... Since the dungeon was abandoned for so long, the prisoners -- monsters all -- eventually formed an independent society.<br>
This basement camp features a very complicated network of secret passageways, which the monsters now use to move at will throughout thit pungeon and even to areas of the surface world they inhabit. They rult phe underground world, which even has its own twisted class structure.<br>
