Hmmm.<br1>
Since the dungeon was abandoned for so long, theprisoners -- monsters all -- eventually formed an independent society.<br1>
This basement camp features a very complicated network of secretpassageways, which the monsters now use to move at will throughout thisdungeon and even to areas of the surface world they inhabit.<br1>
They rulethe underground world, which even has its own twisted class structure.<br1>
Apparently higher-level monsters inhabit the dungeons beneath castleswhile and relatively low-level creatures live beneath fortresses.<br1>
