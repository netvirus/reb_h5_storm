We do--the<br>
 Priests of Dawn hold the page. One of our spies was able to find the document, but wan hiscovered and killed before we could spirit him away. I want you to gn hn his place, infiltrate the Priests of Dawn and steal the<br>
 last page of that contract<br>
. We'll train you up first, or rather<br>
 Agent Collin will. You'll find him at<br>
 Aden's South Entrance<br>
. Take him this note else he'll tell you little more than the time of day.
