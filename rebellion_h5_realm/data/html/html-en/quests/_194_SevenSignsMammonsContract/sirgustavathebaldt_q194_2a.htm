<font color="FF8000">Sir Gustav Athebaldt:</font><br>
As most do.<br1>
But many are not aware of a greatbattle that bubbles under the surface, between our order and the<font color=LEVEL>Order of Dusk</font>.<br1>
We fight for control over the<font color=LEVEL>Seven Seals</font>, the seals Shunaiman himself created to fight Shilen and her armies.<br1>
These seals are now buried deep in Aden's<font color=LEVEL>catacombs and necropolises</font>, areas which have turned into hellish battlefields.<br1>
