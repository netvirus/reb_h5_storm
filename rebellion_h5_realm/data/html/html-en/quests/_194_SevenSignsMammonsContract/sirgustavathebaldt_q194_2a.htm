Sir Gustav Athebaldt:<br>
As most do. But many are not aware of a great battle that bubbles under the surface, between our order and the<br>
 Order of Dusk<br>
. We fight for control over the<br>
 Seven Seals<br>
, the seals Shunaiman himself created to fight Shilen and her armies.<br>
These seals are now buried deep in Aden's<br>
 catacombs and necropolises<br>
, areas which have turned into hellish battlefields.<br>
