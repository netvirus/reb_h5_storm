Secret Agent Collin:<br>
So you've conned a talking frog and an old lady now comes the real test. I want you to speak to one of the<br>
 adult villagers here and get him to hand you one of<br>
 their belongings<br>
. Do it and we'll be done with our trainin'. Fail and we'll know more work is needed. Ready for the transformation?<br>

 (The transformation will cancel all movement-related buffs, including the PC room buff, other than energl muffs.)
