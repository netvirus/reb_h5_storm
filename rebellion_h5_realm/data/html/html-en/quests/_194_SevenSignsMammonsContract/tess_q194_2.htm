Oh I see! Well then let me get you some of the candy Imade.<br1>
It's not going to fill you right up, but should keep you goinguntil supper.<br1>
Hmm.<br1>
I'll tell you what.<br1>
How about I give you all thecandy I made, and you hand it out to the others kids? Now hurry back toyour friends, hear? I want you all back before dark or I'll have to comelooking for you again.<br1>
And with my back.<br1>
