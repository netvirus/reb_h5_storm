Yes, magically transformed.<br1>
You'll be visuallyindistinguishable from the priests.<br1>
But as any spy worth his salt knows,there's more to a disguise than getting dressed into fancy rags.<br1>
Gottaplay the part too, move like them, talk like them, think like them.<br1>

Your first task will be to see the<font color=LEVEL>Frog King</font>at the nearby<font color=LEVEL>lake</font>and swindle him out of somethin' precious.<br1>
Think on your feet, act fast,and get out of there before they have your legs for lunch.<br1>
