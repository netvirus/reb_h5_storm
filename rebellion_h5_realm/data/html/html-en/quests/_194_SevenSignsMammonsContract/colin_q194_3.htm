Secret Agent Collin:<br>
Yes, magically transformed. You'll be visually indistinguishable from the priests. But as any spy worth his salt knows there's more to a disguise than getting dressed into fancy rags. Gotta play the part too, move like them, talk like them, think like them.<br>
Right, enough chat. Your first task will be to see the<br>
 Frog King at the nearby<br>
 lake and swindle him out of somethin' precious. Think on your feet, act fast and get out of there before they have your legs for lunch. Remember what I told you and keep your wits about you!<br>
