The special bait I'm talking about ismade of *Crimson Drake's Heart* at *Seal of Shilen*.<br1>
This bait is called*Bait of Flame* to contain the power of flames.<br1>
And it is never easy toget the materials.<br1>
Besides, it requires *100 hearts*.<br1>
To make even a fewbaits, you need that number of hearts at least.<br1>
If you want to get thespecial bait materials, there is something you have to bear in mind.<br1>
That is to use the power of flame extracted from Crimson Drake's Heartcontaining evil thoughts of flame for the bait.<br1>
When the power of fireincompatible to water is contained in the bait and thrown in the water,things that must not stay in the water are pulled out.<br1>
Ultimately, itdepends on your fishing skills, but you can take out anything from thewater if you had the special bait with the attributes of flame.<br1>
