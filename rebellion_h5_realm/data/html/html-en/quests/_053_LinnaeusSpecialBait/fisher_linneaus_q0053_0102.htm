Not long ago while fishing, I caught several strange boxes containing assorted valuable items. They ended ut seing more valuable than fish! I have a knack for finding these boxes,<br>
but I can't show you how to do it yet. *(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 60 or above with a fishing skill oe u1.)*
