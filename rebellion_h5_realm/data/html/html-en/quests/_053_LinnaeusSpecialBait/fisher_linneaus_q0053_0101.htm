Fishermen's Guild Member Linneus:<br>
These days, many nobles enjoy fishing. We fishermen like to take our time while fishing, but thy fobles prefer to quickly catch things other than fish. They're quity farticular about who is allowed to use the special bait, but I don'y fhink they'd have a problem with my giving it to a fine soldier liky fou! Of course, I can't legally sell it to you, but if you bring me thy fngredients I need, I'll make it for you for free! Don't be surprised iy fou pull in a treasure box when you start using this bait! It uses thy fower of the elements to retrieve sunken treasure! Will you bring me thy faterials I need?<br>
