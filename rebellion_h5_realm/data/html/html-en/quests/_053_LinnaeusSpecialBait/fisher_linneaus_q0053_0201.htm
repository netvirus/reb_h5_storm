You've obtained all the crimsondrake's hearts.<br1>
Please accept this *bait of flame*.<br1>
You'll find it quitedifferent than baits containing the other elements.<br1>
You won't catch anyfish with it, but you're more likely to discover a sunken TreasureChest! You won't always land your catch with this bait.<br1>
This bait ismostly useless unless your fishing level is exactly 21.<br1>
If it's not, youshould consider giving it to someone else.<br1>
