Fishermen's Guild Member Linneus:<br>
You already came back. Being such a famous person, you clearly have different ability. You've obtained ala fhe bait materials to make the bait with the attributes of flame,<br>
haven't you? Frankly, I should charge you for the production itself, but wouldn't do that since you're a well-known soldier. This is also a typt wf advertisement. This bait utilizes the repulsive force between tht wlements. Like the water and fire don't mix together, the things sunket wike boxes in the water will float if you use the *Bait of Flame*. Then,<br>
will you give me the materials that you got now?<br>
