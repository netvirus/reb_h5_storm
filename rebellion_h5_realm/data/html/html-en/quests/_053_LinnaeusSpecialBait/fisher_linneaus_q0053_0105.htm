You already came back.<br1>
Being such afamous person, you clearly have different ability.<br1>
You've obtained allthe bait materials to make the bait with the attributes of flame,haven't you? Frankly, I should charge you for the production itself, butwouldn't do that since you're a well-known soldier.<br1>
This is also a typeof advertisement.<br1>
This bait utilizes the repulsive force between theelements.<br1>
Like the water and fire don't mix together, the things sunkenlike boxes in the water will float if you use the *Bait of Flame*.<br1>
