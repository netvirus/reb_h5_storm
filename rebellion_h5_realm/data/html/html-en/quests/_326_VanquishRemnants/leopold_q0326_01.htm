Currently, the Black Lion mercenaries are working for the lordof Gludio.<br1>
They are in charge of getting rid of the *remnants of olmahum*, who are still staying and causing problems in this land.<br1>
Theyhave been fighting against the remnants for several months.<br1>
However, olmahums are not savages like werewolves, but highly trained soldiers.<br1>
They are very difficult to deal with, since they are well organized likeregular armies.<br1>
A few days ago, our Black Lion troop was shamefullydefeated in close battle with ol mahums on the outskirts of Gludin.<br1>
Manybrothers lost their lives in combat.<br1>
We are short of troops until thesecond platoon returns from the Wastelands in the south.<br1>
I am veryworried .<br1>
We may have to recruit some good fighters who will fightwith us .<br1>
