Comrade, how is the situation on the battlefield? As you haveno badge of the ol mahum in your hand, I see your performance has notbeen good.<br1>
If you think fighting against the ol mahum is too difficultfor you, you can always quit.<br1>
It is better for both of us if youacknowledge your limits instead of aiming too high.<br1>
If you are thinkingof continuing to fight ol mahums, I will give you some advice.<br1>
As Ialready told you, the ol mahum may seem like savage beasts, but theyhave an organization that has been trained as well as any country'sofficial army.<br1>
Ol mahums will help companions in danger, so you may haveto face several ol mahums at once.<br1>
Unless you form a troop like them,you have no choice but to approach them carefully and use guerillatactics to deal with them one at a time.<br1>
Knights may say it is adishonorable way to fight, but it's quite an effective method.<br1>
