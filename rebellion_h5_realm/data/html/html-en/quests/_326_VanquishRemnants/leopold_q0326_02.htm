Currently, the Black Lion mercenaries are working for the lordof Gludio.<br1>
They are in charge of getting rid of the *remnants of olmahum*, who are still staying and causing problems in this land.<br1>
Theyhave been fighting against the remnants for several months.<br1>
However, olmahums are not savages like werewolves, but highly trained soldiers.<br1>
They are very difficult to deal with, since they are well organized likeregular armies.<br1>
A few days ago, our Black Lion troop was shamefullydefeated in a close battle with ol mahums on the outskirts of Gludin.<br1>
Many brothers lost their lives in combat.<br1>
We are short of troops untilour brothers of the second platoon, who have been dispatched to theWastelands in the south, return.<br1>
So we have decided to recruit skilledfighters to temporarily fill our troop.<br1>
From the scars on your armor andthe way you hold your weapon, you seem like you have had a lot ofexperience on the field.<br1>
What do you think? Won't you fight for theBlack Lions? It is an opportunity to play a role in punishing the cruelol mahum who have ruined this land.<br1>
