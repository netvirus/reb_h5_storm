You must heed my every word.<br1>
We each have our own tasksto do.<br1>
While I am away you must investigate the mutations one at a time.<br1>
They are *Ol Mahum Captain*, *Turek Orc Warlord*, *Ant Captain*, and*Turak Bugbear Warrior*.<br1>
That's it.<br1>
I expect that they each have abezoar planted in their bodies.<br1>
The problem is that these creatures areall very aggressive, even more so than normal.<br1>
But I think you canhandle it.<br1>
