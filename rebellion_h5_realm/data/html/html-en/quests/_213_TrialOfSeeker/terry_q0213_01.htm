Ah, a letter from Master Dufner.<br1>
Yes, I am he who wasonce called the 'Hawkeye'.<br1>
But Hawkeye is no more.<br1>
You can't possiblyexpect me to revive Hawkeye now.<br1>
That is too much.<br1>
.<br1>
Only MasterDufner would ask such a favor.<br1>
It was he who helped me abandon Hawkeyeand settle down in this town.<br1>
