Well.<br1>
I guess I have no choice.<br1>
I have been curiousabout the increase in those mutations.<br1>
But first you must do me afavor.<br1>
I will need some time to revive Hawkeye.<br1>
In the meantime, I needyou to do some planning and scout the area.<br1>
We need a rough Map of themonsters' mutations.<br1>
You must capture one and bring it to me.<br1>
We willmake our next move according to what we find.<br1>
