So, there are 4 Dark Bezoars altogether! I am so glad tosee you alive.<br1>
Master Dufner, he still has the sense for recognizingtalented people.<br1>
Thanks to you, I could solve the problem in a shorthour.<br1>
Oh, I guess you must also be curious about the results? I secretlyfound out that there was a group of people called the 'children ofShilen' behind this case.<br1>
Did you ever hear of the name? They are thefollowers of Shilen who are looking forward to the resurrection of theirGoddess.<br1>
They are working secretly so few people know about them.<br1>
TheRoyal palace is busy enough dealing with the war, and they have no timeto take measures against them.<br1>
This is becoming a serious matter nowthat it turned out to be their organization that is related to thiscase.<br1>
This is not something that we can just overlook.<br1>
I shall have toreport this.<br1>
This is a report which contains the details on this case.<br1>
Take it to Master Dufner.<br1>
He will take care of the rest.<br1>
You have done agood job, thank you.<br1>
