I think you are sufficiently prepared now.<br1>
I will tellyou about the next task.<br1>
Being contaminated by a Dark Bezoar issomething to worry about; however, according to Marina's research, thecontamination seems to be limited to only a few creatures.<br1>
I want you tobe in charge of getting rid of those hosts.<br1>
Marsh stakato drones, BrekaOrc overlords, noble ant leaders, and Leto Lizardmen warriors are on thelist.<br1>
Of course, these creatures all have tendencies to be aggressive.<br1>
Extract the Dark Bezoars from their bodies.<br1>
