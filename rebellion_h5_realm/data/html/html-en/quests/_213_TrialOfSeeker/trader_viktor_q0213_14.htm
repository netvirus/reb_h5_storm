10! Yes you have brought all 10 of them.<br1>
Haha.<br1>
This takes me one step further in my plan.<br1>
Ha ha ha! Did I saythat out loud? Never mind, I was just daydreaming.<br1>
You have provenyourself and I shall give you the information you seek.<br1>
While you werehunting I was studying the bezoar.<br1>
It is also known as 'Abyss SpiritOre'.<br1>
It is often associated with Shilen, the Goddess of Abyss.<br1>
How do Iknow this? When you flash a particular wavelength of light, theemanation of the refraction-dispersion creates a typical distribution ofRuper's curve.<br1>
If you magnify the pattern, apply the Magnus' constant,compare it by Bernu's analysis, you will find a shape similar toShilen's pattern between the 8th and the 9th diagram.<br1>
What does thismean? It means that this bezoar is related to Shilen.<br1>
I could tell youmore but you wouldn't understand.<br1>
However, there is one problem.<br1>
