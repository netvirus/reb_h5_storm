How is the hunting going? Being contaminated by a DarkBezoar is something to worry about; however, according to Marina'sresearch, the contamination seems to be limited to only a few creatures.<br1>
I want you to be in charge of getting rid of those hosts.<br1>
Marsh StakatoDrones, Breka Orc Overlords, Ant Warrior Captains, and Leto LizardmanWarriors are on the list.<br1>
Of course, these creatures all have tendenciesto be aggressive.<br1>
Extract the Dark Bezoars from their bodies.<br1>
