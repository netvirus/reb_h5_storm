I think you are ready for the next task.<br1>
Beingcontaminated by a Dark Bezoar is somewhat worrisome, but according toMarina's research, the contamination is limited to only a few creatures.<br1>
You must destroy those hosts.<br1>
*Marsh Stakato Drones*, *Breka OrcOverlords*, *Ant Warrior Captains*, and *Leto Lizardman Warriors* arethe monsters you must hunt.<br1>
Of course, these creatures all have*aggressive tendencies*.<br1>
Extract the Dark Bezoars from their bodies.<br1>
