Since time is of the essence we must attack themsystematically.<br1>
Now listen carefully! The Ol Mahum Captain can be found*near the Fortress of Resistance* in the northeast.<br1>
Next you must go toGludio, which is quite a distance away.<br1>
I guess it is becoming obviousthat these mutations happened simultaneously in several places aroundthe world.<br1>
You can find the Turek Orc Warlord at the *Orc Barracks* inthe northern part of Gludio.<br1>
You can find the Ant Captain in the*Wastelands* of Gludio.<br1>
Try the underground *Ant's Nest*.<br1>
You should notattempt this one alone.<br1>
And last, the most dangerous of them all.<br1>
Have you ever seen the so-called Turak bugbears wandering about *GorgonFlower Garden in Giran*? Turak bugbear Warriors are their leaders.<br1>
Nowthen, let's get busy.<br1>
You start your task and I shall follow you soonthereafter.<br1>
