I'm not sure if you are aware of it, but the magicalcreatures have been acting very strange lately.<br1>
They seem to beorganizing for something.<br1>
I am sure this is a bad sign.<br1>
We must find outwhat those mutants are up to! While it is important to have youngvolunteers like yourself in service to the kingdom, this particular taskrequires someone that is skilled in concealment and scouting.<br1>
I don'tthink you are up to the task.<br1>
If you know anyone that possesses theseskills, please tell me.<br1>
