I am sure you are aware that creatures who have an AbyssSpirit Ore inside them have exceptional intelligence.<br1>
The matter wouldnot be so dangerous if that's all there was to it, but these creaturesare extremely hostile towards Elves, Dark Elves, Orcs, Dwarves andHumans.<br1>
Do you understand why those creatures have become soaggressive?.<br1>
They are very clever so they will surely influence theirfellow creatures.<br1>
Imagine the carnage if they incite the others! I amconvinced that this has something to do with the Goddess Shilen.<br1>
Thedark powers of Shilen are the origin of the Dark Bezoars.<br1>
It is saidthe Goddess of Darkness and the original Goddess of Water traveled east,where she created many different magical creatures.<br1>
It is quite alarminghow many years have passed and only now are Shilen's powers are beingdetected in the monsters.<br1>
The most frightening part we have learned fromthis experiment is that the Dark Bezoar is contagious.<br1>
Moreover,according to Marina's experiment, these Bezoars are not natural, butmanufactured.<br1>
The road ahead will be rough.<br1>
We will both be tested toour limits.<br1>
