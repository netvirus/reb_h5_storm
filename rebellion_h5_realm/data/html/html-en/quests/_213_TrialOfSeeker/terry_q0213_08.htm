I hope your investigation is going well? Time is short soyou must hurry.<br1>
Do you remember your task? You must hunt *Ol MahumCaptains*, *Turek Orc Warlords*, *Ant Captain*, and *Turak BugbearWarriors*.<br1>
Catch them and collect the bezoars from their bodies.<br1>
I amnot sure if it is due to the bezoars, but they are behaving very*aggressively*.<br1>
Please, be careful.<br1>
