Take this letter and the box containing the bezoars to*Viktor of the Hunter's Village*.<br1>
He is an expert in such matters.<br1>
Backwhen I was called Hawkeye, he was known as the clairvoyant.<br1>
He is quitewell known for being an excellent source of information, even to thisday.<br1>
I am sure he'll be able to find something out from the bezoars.<br1>
Heowns a shop at the moment.<br1>
A very unlikely occupation for him.<br1>
Anyway, take this letter to him.<br1>
Tell him that Hawkeye sent you, he willtalk to you.<br1>
If he feigns a lack of understanding, say *'AltebarKarryos'* loudly.<br1>
That is my real name.<br1>
By the way, he never doesanything for free.<br1>
He will probably ask you for something.<br1>
In thatcase, use your own judgement.<br1>
