For now, the guild has decided to keep our investigationof this matter secret.<br1>
For that we must have the aid of guild membersskilled in concealment and scouting, like yourself.<br1>
Of course, you mustalso be able to defend yourself in dangerous situations.<br1>
Conflict withthe mutants will be unavoidable.<br1>
I must warn you, your life will be atgreat risk.<br1>
But such is the life of a Scout.<br1>
This is a great opportunityto prove your skills.<br1>
