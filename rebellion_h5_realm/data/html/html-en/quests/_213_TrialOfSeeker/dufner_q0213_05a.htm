Very well! This is just my opinion, but I suspect thatit will be easier for you to first find and kill some of those evilmutants and then investigate.<br1>
Once your investigation reaches a certainpoint, howver, I'm reasonably certain that you will encounter asituation you cannot handle by yourself.<br1>
Let me introduce you to someonewho might be able to assist you.<br1>
He is currently in hiding, masqueradinglike any other master, but in his day he was a feared assassin known as"Hawkeye.<br1>
" His targets could never escape his ruthless aim.<br1>
Take thisletter to him and ask him for help.<br1>
I have included some additionalinformation about him for your enlightenment.<br1>
Please be careful that itdoesn't fall into the wrong hands.<br1>
Also, take this *Dimension Diamond*.<br1>
You can trade this *Dimension Diamond* for something special from thevillage gatekeeper, and it will help you a lot on your journey.<br1>
