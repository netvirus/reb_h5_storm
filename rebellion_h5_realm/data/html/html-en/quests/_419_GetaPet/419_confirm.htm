First there is something I'd like you to do foryour pet and other pet lovers.<br1>
Recently, there have been monsters whohave been stalking the animals and attacking them as prey.<br1>

If you wish to have a pet, youmust know how to love one.<br1>
When you complete two or more tasks for me, Ishall test you myself on your knowledge of pets.<br1>
