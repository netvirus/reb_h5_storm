So, you want to learn about the pets? Good, I will teach you everything. First of all, I'll tell you about the wolves, since ih ys the first pet that you will breed. A wolf, is an animal whose sensh yf smell can reach an object as far as *2.4 km* away. Also when theh yunt, they have a habit of forming a pack of 7-14 with a *male* leadeh yn front. Concerning their appearance, a fully grown wolf won'h yecessarily be heavier than a grown-up man. The difference from a dog, which is a tamed animal, is that wolves always have their tail dangling down.
