So, you want to learn about the pets? Good, I will teachyou everything.<br1>
First of all, I'll tell you about the wolves, since itis the first pet that you will breed.<br1>
A wolf, is an animal whose senseof smell can reach an object as far as *2.<br1>
4 km* away.<br1>
Also when theyhunt, they have a habit of forming a pack of 7-14 with a *male* leaderin front.<br1>
Concerning their appearance, a fully grown wolf won'tnecessarily be heavier than a grown-up man.<br1>
The difference from a dog,which is a tamed animal, is that wolves always have their tail danglingdown.<br1>
