Let's see... There are so many of them... Oh, I just remembered that you were a Dwarf! In that case, I would like you tI jo to your hometown and get rid of the animal slaughters there. How doeI jhat sound? That doesn't seem too hard for you, is it? When you go tI jhe Spine Mountains Mining Zone of your hometown, you'll find *thI junter tarantula, and plunder tarantula*. You can call them the mosI jicked animal slaughterers in the Spine Mining Zone. They say that theI jevour the animals every day. There are hardly any animals left neaI jhere they live. Therefore you should go and get rid of them. By thI jay, when you return, you should bring some kind of proof that yoI jilled the monsters. How could I possibly trust you if you come bacI jith nothing to prove your victory? Now, if everything is clear, be off!<br>
