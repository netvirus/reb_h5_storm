Let's see.<br1>
There are so many of them.<br1>
Oh, Ijust remembered that you were a Dwarf! In that case, I would like you togo to your hometown and get rid of the animal slaughters there.<br1>
How doesthat sound? That doesn't seem too hard for you, is it? When you go tothe Spine Mountains Mining Zone of your hometown, you'll find *thehunter tarantula, and plunder tarantula*.<br1>
You can call them the mostwicked animal slaughterers in the Spine Mining Zone.<br1>
They say that theydevour the animals every day.<br1>
There are hardly any animals left nearwhere they live.<br1>
Therefore you should go and get rid of them.<br1>
By theway, when you return, you should bring some kind of proof that youkilled the monsters.<br1>
