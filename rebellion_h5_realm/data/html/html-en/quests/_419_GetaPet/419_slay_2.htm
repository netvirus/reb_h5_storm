Let's see.<br1>
There are so many of them.<br1>
Oh, Ijust remembered that you were a Dark Elf.<br1>
In that case, I would like youto go to your hometown and get rid of the animal slaughters there.<br1>
Howdoes that sound? That doesn't seem too hard for you, is it? If you go tothe Dark Elven Forest, you'll be able to find *the lesser dark horror,dark horror, and the prowler*.<br1>
They are the most wicked animalslaughterers in the Dark Elven Forest.<br1>
They say that they devour theanimals every day.<br1>
There are hardly any animals left near where theylive.<br1>
Therefore you should go and get rid of them.<br1>
By the way, when youreturn, you should bring some kind of proof that you killed themonsters.<br1>
