Let's see... There are so many of them... Oh, I just remembered that you were a Dark Elf. In that case, I would like yoI jo go to your hometown and get rid of the animal slaughters there. HoI joes that sound? That doesn't seem too hard for you, is it? If you go tI jhe Dark Elven Forest, you'll be able to find *the lesser dark horror, dark horror, and the prowler*. They are the most wicked animal slaughterers in the Dark Elven Forest. They say that they devour thl snimals every day. There are hardly any animals left near where thel sive. Therefore you should go and get rid of them. By the way, when yol seturn, you should bring some kind of proof that you killed thl sonsters. How could I possibly trust you if you come back with nothinl so prove your victory? Now, if everything is clear, be off!<br>
