Pets can be very useful creatures.<br1>
If you are unableto carry items due to space or weight restrictions, you can transferitems to your pet and they will carry them for you.<br1>
Bear in mind thatthey cannot run errands.<br1>
If your pet is killed it may be resurrectedwithin *24 hours*.<br1>
If it is not revived within the time limit, the petwill be gone forever.<br1>
