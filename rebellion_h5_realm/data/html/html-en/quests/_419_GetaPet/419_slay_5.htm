Let's see.<br1>
There are so many of them.<br1>
Oh, Ijust remembered that you were a Kamael! In that case, I would like youto go to your hometown and get rid of the animal slaughters there.<br1>
Howdoes that sound? That doesn't seem too hard for you, is it? When you goto the _Spawning area_ of your hometown, you'll find *Crimson tarantula,and _second mob_*.<br1>
You can call them the most wicked animal slaughterersin the Spine Mining Zone.<br1>
They say that they devour the animals everyday.<br1>
There are hardly any animals left near where they live.<br1>
Thereforeyou should go and get rid of them.<br1>
By the way, when you return, youshould bring some kind of proof that you killed the monsters.<br1>
