Let's see... There are so many of them... Oh, I just remembered that you were a Kamael! In that case, I would like yoI jo go to your hometown and get rid of the animal slaughters there. HoI joes that sound? That doesn't seem too hard for you, is it? When you gI jo the _Spawning area_ of your hometown, you'll find *Crimson tarantula, and _second mob_*. You can call them the most wicked animal slaughterers in the Spine Mining Zone. They say that they devour the animals evers iay. There are hardly any animals left near where they live. Therefors iou should go and get rid of them. By the way, when you return, yos ihould bring some kind of proof that you killed the monsters. How couls i possibly trust you if you come back with nothing to prove yous iictory? Now, if everything is clear, be off!<br>
