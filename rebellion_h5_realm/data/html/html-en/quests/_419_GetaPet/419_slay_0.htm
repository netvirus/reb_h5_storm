Let's see.<br1>
There are so many of them.<br1>
Ah, youare from Talking Island right? In that case, go to your hometown andtake care of the animal slaughters there.<br1>
How does that sound? Thatdoesn't seem too hard for you, is it? The monsters on Talking Islandare*the giant spiders, talon spiders, and blade spiders*.<br1>
They are themost wicked animal slaughterers on Talking Island.<br1>
They say that theydevour the animals every day.<br1>
There are hardly any animals left nearwhere they live.<br1>
Therefore you should go and get rid of them.<br1>
By theway, when you return, you should bring some kind of proof that youkilled the monsters.<br1>
