Let's see... There are so many of them... Ah, you are from Talking Island right? In that case, go to your hometown anu aake care of the animal slaughters there. How does that sound? Thau aoesn't seem too hard for you, is it? The monsters on Talking Islanu are*the giant spiders, talon spiders, and blade spiders*. They are thu aost wicked animal slaughterers on Talking Island. They say that theu aevour the animals every day. There are hardly any animals left neau ahere they live. Therefore you should go and get rid of them. By thu aay, when you return, you should bring some kind of proof that you ailled the monsters. How could I possibly trust you if you come bacu aith nothing to prove your victory? Now, if everything is clear, be off!<br>
