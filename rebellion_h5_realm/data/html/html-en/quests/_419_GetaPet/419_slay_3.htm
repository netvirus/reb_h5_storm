Let's see.<br1>
There are so many of them.<br1>
Oh, Ijust remembered that you were one of the Orcs! In that case, I wouldlike you to go to your hometown and get rid of the animal slaughtersthere.<br1>
How does that sound? That doesn't seem too hard for you, is it?If you go to the Indomitable Plateau of your hometown, you'll confront*the kasha spider, kasha fang spiders and kasha blade spiders*.<br1>
They arethe most wicked animal slaughterers in the area.<br1>
They say that theydevour the animals every day.<br1>
There are hardly any animals left nearwhere they live.<br1>
Therefore you should go and get rid of them.<br1>
By theway, when you return, you should bring some kind of proof that youkilled the monsters.<br1>
