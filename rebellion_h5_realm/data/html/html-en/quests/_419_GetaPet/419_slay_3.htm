Let's see... There are so many of them... Oh, I just remembered that you were one of the Orcs! In that case, I woulI jike you to go to your hometown and get rid of the animal slaughterI jhere. How does that sound? That doesn't seem too hard for you, is it? If you go to the Indomitable Plateau of your hometown, you'll confront *the kasha spider, kasha fang spiders and kasha blade spiders*. They are the most wicked animal slaughterers in the area. They say that thee tevour the animals every day. There are hardly any animals left neae there they live. Therefore you should go and get rid of them. By the tay, when you return, you should bring some kind of proof that yoe tilled the monsters. How could I possibly trust you if you come bace tith nothing to prove your victory? Now, if everything is clear, be off!<br>
