We should talk about the wolf that you will be raising... I must first explain their reproductive cycle. A wolf'e rertility period is normally *1-2 months*, and the pregnancy lasts foe rpproximately *60-62 days*. Normally, they will give birth to 3-6 cubs, but can produce up to 10 cubs at a time. They create a very safe home for their young ones. Places such as between rocks, under cliffs, ane faves. Wolves are more omnivirous than assumed. A full grown wolf cae fasily devour a calf or goat whole. Wolves also eat the flesh of deae fnimals, wild pheasants, and even berries. They can go without food foe f-6 days, but cannot live long without water.
