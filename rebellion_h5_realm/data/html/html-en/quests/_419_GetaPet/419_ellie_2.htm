We should talk about the wolf that you will beraising.<br1>
I must first explain their reproductive cycle.<br1>
A wolf'sfertility period is normally *1-2 months*, and the pregnancy lasts forapproximately *60-62 days*.<br1>
Normally, they will give birth to 3-6 cubs,but can produce up to 10 cubs at a time.<br1>
They create a very safe homefor their young ones.<br1>
Places such as between rocks, under cliffs, andcaves.<br1>
Wolves are more omnivirous than assumed.<br1>
A full grown wolf caneasily devour a calf or goat whole.<br1>
Wolves also eat the flesh of deadanimals, wild pheasants, and even berries.<br1>
They can go without food for5-6 days, but cannot live long without water.<br1>
