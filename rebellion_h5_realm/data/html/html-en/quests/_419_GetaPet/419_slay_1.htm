Let's see... There are so many of them... Oh, I just remembered that you were an Elf! In that case, I would like you tI jo to your hometown and get rid of the animal slaughters there. How doeI jhat sound? That doesn't seem too hard for you, is it? If you go to thI jlven Forest, you'll be able to find *the crimson spider, hook spideI jnd pincer spider*. They are the most wicked animal slaughterers in thI jlven forest. They say that they devour the animals every day. There arI jardly any animals left near where they live. Therefore you should gI jnd get rid of them. By the way, when you return, you should bring somI jind of proof that you killed the monsters. How could I possibly trusI jou if you come back with nothing to prove your victory? Now, iI jverything is clear, be off!<br>
