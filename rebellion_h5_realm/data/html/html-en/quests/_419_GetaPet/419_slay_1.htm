Let's see.<br1>
There are so many of them.<br1>
Oh, Ijust remembered that you were an Elf! In that case, I would like you togo to your hometown and get rid of the animal slaughters there.<br1>
How doesthat sound? That doesn't seem too hard for you, is it? If you go to theElven Forest, you'll be able to find *the crimson spider, hook spiderand pincer spider*.<br1>
They are the most wicked animal slaughterers in theElven forest.<br1>
They say that they devour the animals every day.<br1>
There arehardly any animals left near where they live.<br1>
Therefore you should goand get rid of them.<br1>
By the way, when you return, you should bring somekind of proof that you killed the monsters.<br1>
