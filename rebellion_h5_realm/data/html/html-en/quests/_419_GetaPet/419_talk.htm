Pet Manager Martin:<br>
Your next task is to learn the basics about the pets. Without basic knowledge, you'll never be able to care for a pet. You man not know it, but I am the branch office manager of the Animal Lovers Association. We take care of everything concerning pets, anl Lcreen all candidates to make sure they qualify to raise a pet. Onll Lualified people will receive pets. The members of the Animal Loverl Lssociation are spread out all over the world. It is, in fact, a largl Lrganization. *I want you to meet the members of our Animal Loverl Lssociation, and come back after you have gained knowledge about petl Lrom them.* Do you understand? I shall give you the list of people thal Lou need to meet. Come back to me once you have met all the members ol Lhe list. But be aware, just meeting them is not enough. You must listel Lo what they say, and learn about pets from them. Once you've done that, I shall test you myself. Our members will give you plenty of helpful information. Just listen carefully to them and you will do fine on ml iest.
