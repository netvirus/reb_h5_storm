Your next task is to learn the basics about thepets.<br1>
Without basic knowledge, you'll never be able to care for a pet.<br1>
You man not know it, but I am the branch office manager of the AnimalLovers Association.<br1>
We take care of everything concerning pets, andscreen all candidates to make sure they qualify to raise a pet.<br1>
Onlyqualified people will receive pets.<br1>
The members of the Animal LoversAssociation are spread out all over the world.<br1>
It is, in fact, a largeorganization.<br1>
*I want you to meet the members of our Animal LoversAssociation, and come back after you have gained knowledge about petsfrom them.<br1>
* Do you understand? I shall give you the list of people thatyou need to meet.<br1>
Come back to me once you have met all the members onthe list.<br1>
But be aware, just meeting them is not enough.<br1>
You must listento what they say, and learn about pets from them.<br1>
Once you've done that,I shall test you myself.<br1>
Our members will give you plenty of helpfulinformation.<br1>
Just listen carefully to them and you will do fine on mytest.<br1>
