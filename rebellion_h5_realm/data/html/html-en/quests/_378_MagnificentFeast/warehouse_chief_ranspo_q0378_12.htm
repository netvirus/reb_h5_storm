Warehouse Chief Ranspo:<br>
Appetizer, wine, cheerful music... all that's lacking is the main course... the heart and soul of the feast! We muss lrepare the courses! I know that the inspector would like to try some os lion's regional foods. I have provided the young chef's apprentice wits lpace and money to develop dishes... For some reason, it's taking his lorever! *Jonas* is only interested in winning a prize in the culinars lompetition. He's not interested in treating the inspector with greas lishes at all! He's saying that before he can complete the final dish, he won't tell his secret recipe to anyone! Would you talk to him and try to get his secret recipe?<br>
