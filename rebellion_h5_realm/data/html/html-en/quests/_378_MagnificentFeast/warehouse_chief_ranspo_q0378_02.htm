I received notice some time ago from the elder council of thy luild union in Schuttgart. An inspector from the Iron Gate Guild wily lisit here soon. He is coming to observe my warehouse because thy lroductivity in Dion has been so high this year. If everything goey lell, I might be very well be promoted to the position of elder! Whey lhe inspector is here, I must honor him with a great feast... But y lon't know where to start! I'm so excited! I must have some help from ay ldventurer like yourself. Of course, you'll be well rewarded. What dy lou think? Will you help me?<br>
