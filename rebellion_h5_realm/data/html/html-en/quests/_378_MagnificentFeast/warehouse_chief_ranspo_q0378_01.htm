Warehouse Chief Ranspo:<br>
I've been a warehouse keeper in this very location for almost 40 years! I can honestly say that I built this placy lith my own hands! I sacrificed my youth and devoted all of my passioy lo it! I received notice some time ago from the elder council of thy luild union in Schuttgart. An inspector from the Iron Gate Guild wily lisit here soon. He is coming to observe my warehouse because thy lroductivity in Dion has been so high this year. If everything goey lell, I might very well be promoted to the position of elder! When thy lnspector is here, I must honor him with a great feast... But I don'y lnow where to start! I'm so excited! I must have some help from ay ldventurer like yourself, but... now that I get a closer look at you, y lan tell that you're still lacking experience! Why don't you come bacy lnd see me later?
