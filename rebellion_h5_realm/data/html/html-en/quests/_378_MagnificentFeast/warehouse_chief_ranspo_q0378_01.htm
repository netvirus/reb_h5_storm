<font color="36DC25">Warehouse Chief Ranspo:</font><br>
I've been a warehouse keeper in this verylocation for almost 40 years! I can honestly say that I built this placewith my own hands! I sacrificed my youth and devoted all of my passionto it! I received notice some time ago from the elder council of theguild union in Schuttgart.<br1>
An inspector from the Iron Gate Guild willvisit here soon.<br1>
He is coming to observe my warehouse because theproductivity in Dion has been so high this year.<br1>
If everything goeswell, I might very well be promoted to the position of elder! When theinspector is here, I must honor him with a great feast.<br1>
But I don'tknow where to start! I'm so excited! I must have some help from anadventurer like yourself, but.<br1>
