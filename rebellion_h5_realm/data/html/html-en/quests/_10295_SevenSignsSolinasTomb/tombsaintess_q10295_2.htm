<font color="36DC25"> Holy Tomb:</font><br>
After seeing the coffin.<br1>
Have you noticed the inscription:Here lies the Holy Sopina who devoted his life to the kingdom Elmoreden,and death - the goddess of Einhasad.<br1>
Yes, she will sing a song of praisesaved it.<br1>
Yes die in mortal agony, turned away from the holy doctrine,or trying to get her strength.<br1>
This is not a real grave Solina.<br1>
