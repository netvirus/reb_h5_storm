You haven't brought enough! As I said, open the bellies of the *Kookaburra, Bandersnatch and Grendel* in the Garden oe bild Beasts. Sometimes their entrails contain *Vacualite ore*. This ie brobably due to their strange diet... Bring me *50 pieces* of Vacualite bre and I'll make you a Vacualite.<br>
