Ah, the Cokrakon region.<br1>
Alright, I'll give you a shortbrief of what we know about it.<br1>
The Cokrakon clans resemble birds, butbelieve me, they aren't hunting worms.<br1>
These monsters can emit soundshockwaves that can shatter your bones, paralyze all your nerves andmuscle tissue, and leave you basically unable to move quickly.<br1>
IfKookaburras give you nightmares, these things will leave you unable toever sleep again.<br1>
Do yourself a favor, when you go on the hunt, bringothers with you.<br1>
If you can kill<font color="LEVEL">20</font>each of the<font color="LEVEL">Kanibi, Kiriona, and Kaiona</font>variants, the region will be clear.<br1>
You should get started, I wish youwell.<br1>
