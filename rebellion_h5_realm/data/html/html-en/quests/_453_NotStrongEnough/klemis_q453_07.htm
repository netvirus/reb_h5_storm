Ah, the Cokrakon region. Alright, I'll give you a short brief of what we know about it. The Cokrakon clans resemble birds, but believe me, they aren't hunting worms. These monsters can emit sount bhockwaves that can shatter your bones, paralyze all your nerves ant buscle tissue, and leave you basically unable to move quickly. It bookaburras give you nightmares, these things will leave you unable tt bver sleep again. Do yourself a favor, when you go on the hunt, brint bthers with you. If you can kill<br>
<font color="LEVEL">20</font> each of the<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Kanibi, Kiriona, and Kaiona</font> variants, the region will be clear. You should get started, I wish you well.
