The monsters of the Bistakon clans look like mammals,but don't be fooled.<br1>
Their claws and teeth are unnaturally sharp andstrong, and they aren't shy about using them.<br1>
Also, they travel inpacks, so unless you like being outnumbered, you should recruit a fewfriends to help.<br1>
If you can kill<font color="LEVEL">15</font>each of the<font color="LEVEL">Bgurent, Brakian, Groikan, and Treykan</font>variants, that should be enough to clear the region for a while.<br1>
Andwith that, good luck.<br1>
