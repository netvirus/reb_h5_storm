Ah, the Reptilikons.<br1>
I'll brief you on them.<br1>
Themonsters of the Reptilikon region are basically enormous reptilianbeasts.<br1>
They are just as vicious as the other beast clans, and tend tobe poisonous to boot.<br1>
Trust me on this - don't go alone.<br1>
That said Ihope it goes well.<br1>
If you can kill<font color="LEVEL">20</font>each of the<font color="LEVEL">Turtlelian, Krajian, and Tardyon</font>variants, we can declare that region safe a while.<br1>
