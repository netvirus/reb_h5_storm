Ah, the Bistakonsâ€¦ well, I know a little somethingabout them.<br1>
Here's a short brief.<br1>
The monsters of the Bistakon clanslook like mammals, but don't be fooled.<br1>
Their claws and teeth areunnaturally sharp and strong, and they aren't shy about using them.<br1>
Also, they travel in packs, so unless you like being outnumbered, youshould recruit a few friends to help.<br1>
If you can kill<font color="LEVEL">15</font>each of the<font color="LEVEL">Bgurent, Brakian, Groikan, and Treykan</font>variants, that should be enough to clear the region for a while.<br1>
Andwith that, good luck.<br1>
