The monsters of the Reptilikon region are basicallyenormous reptilian beasts.<br1>
They are just as vicious as the other beastclans, and tend to be poisonous to boot.<br1>
Trust me on this - don't goalone.<br1>
That said I hope it goes well.<br1>
If you can kill<font color="LEVEL">20</font>each of the<font color="LEVEL">Turtlelian, Krajian, and Tardyon</font>variants, we can declare that region safe a while.<br1>
