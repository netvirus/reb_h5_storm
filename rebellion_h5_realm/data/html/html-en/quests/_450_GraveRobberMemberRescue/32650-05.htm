<br> We can't do anything for the ones who are already possessed	by the evil spirits.<br1>
But there are still some who have escaped their	influence.<br1>
<br> If you see any normal	<font color="LEVEL">Grave Robber Warriors</font> roaming through the	mine, tell them to hide in a safe place.<br1>
Bring me	<font color="LEVEL">10 Evidence of Migration</font> as proof that you	were able to persuade them and I'll reward you handsomely.<br1>
<br> Kuk, but know this: those who are possessed will probably	attack you.<br1>
If that happens, do what you have to do.<br1>
