<font color="LEVEL">Grave Robber Warriors</font> roaming through the mine, tell them to hide in a safe place. Bring me<br>
<font color="LEVEL">10 Evidence of Migration</font> as proof that you were able to persuade them and I'll reward you handsomely. Kuk, but know this: those who are possessed will probably attack you... If that happens, do what you have to do...
