	<br> Finally, Shilen's followers used the dark ceremony they had<br>
	originally intended for Aden on Gracia. They opened a door to the land<br>
	of death:<br>
the Seed. Horrific monsters entered the land, further<br>
	devastating it and its people.<br>
	<br>Now we must all unite against this threat. That's why need<br>
	adventurers willing and able to take this battle to the shores of<br>
	Gracia.<br>
	<br> If we fail, that evil will soon find its way here... We<br>
	desperately need your help!<br>
