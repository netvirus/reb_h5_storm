<font color="36DC25"><html><body>	High Priest Orven:</font><br>
<br> I appreciate your commitment.<br1>
All of Aden will be counting on	you and your comrades.<br1>
<br> Your first challenge will be reaching Gracia.<br1>
First, go to	the	<font color="LEVEL">Aden Airship Dock</font>.<br1>
There you should ask the	manager,	<font color="LEVEL">Magister Papiku</font>, about the details of the	journey.<br1>
<br> Take this.<br1>
It is a letter to	<font color="LEVEL">Keucereus</font>, who currently rules Gracia.<br1>
It	designates you as one of the Aden warriors sent to fight the evil in	his land.<br1>
I pray you will be able to help him.<br1>
and us.<br1>
May Einhasad	shine her blessed light upon your path.<br1>
