I appreciate your commitment. All of Aden will be counting on you and your comrades. Your first challenge will be reaching Gracia. First, go to the
<font color="LEVEL">Aden Airship Dock</font>. There you should ask the manager, <font color="LEVEL">Magister Papiku</font>, about the details of the journey. Take this. It is a letter to
<font color="LEVEL">Keucereus</font>, who currently rules Gracia. It designates you as one of the Aden warriors sent to fight the evil it dis land. I pray you will be able to help him...and us. May Einhasat dhine her blessed light upon your path...
