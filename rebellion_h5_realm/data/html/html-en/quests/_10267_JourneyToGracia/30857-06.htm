	High Priest Orve$1<br>
	<br> I appreciate your commitment. All of Aden will be counting on<br>
	you and your comrades.<br>
	<br> Your first challenge will be reaching Gracia. First, go to<br>
	the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Aden Airship Dock</font>. There you should ask the<br>
	manager,<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Magister Papiku</font>, about the details of the<br>
	journey.<br>
	<br> Take this. It is a letter to<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Keucereus</font>, who currently rules Gracia. It<br>
	designates you as one of the Aden warriors sent to fight the evil in<br>
	his land. I pray you will be able to help him...and us. May Einhasad<br>
	shine her blessed light upon your path...<br>
