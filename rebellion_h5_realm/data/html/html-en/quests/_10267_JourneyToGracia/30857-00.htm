	High Priest Orve$1<br>
	<br> Do you know the tragedy that has befallen<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Gracia</font>? The power of Shilen, the Goddess of<br>
	Death, has manifested itself in the form of a<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Seed</font> that has transformed the entire<br>
	continent into a land of death. Despite the valiant efforts by a few<br>
	lords and their warriors, most of Gracia is chaos and evil.<br>
	<br> Now we need brave adventurers more than ever. However, I'm<br>
	afraid you are not yet ready for so great a trial. Perhaps in the<br>
	future...<br>
	<br> (Only characters who are level 75 or higher may undertake<br>
	this quest.)<br>
