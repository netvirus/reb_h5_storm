<br> Do you know the tragedy that has befallen	<font color="LEVEL">Gracia</font>? The power of Shilen, the Goddess of	Death, has manifested itself in the form of a	<font color="LEVEL">Seed</font> that has transformed the entire	continent into a land of death.<br1>
Despite the valiant efforts by a few	lords and their warriors, most of Gracia is chaos and evil.<br1>
<br> Now we need brave adventurers more than ever.<br1>
However, I'm	afraid you are not yet ready for so great a trial.<br1>
Perhaps in the	future.<br1>
