<br> Are you one of the soldiers from Aden? You deserve a reward	simply for coming such a long way to help us.<br1>
<br> Unfortunately, things are happening very quickly here, and	I'm afraid I don't have the luxury for long conversations.<br1>
<br> Even as we speak, monsters unlike any we've ever seen or	heard of are wreaking havoc on my people.<br1>
They seem to be filled with	insane hatred toward all humanoids.<br1>
<br> But if you have the	<font color="LEVEL"> will and skill to fight them</font>, even these	enemies can be defeated.<br1>
I ask for nothing else.<br1>
Nothing is more	fearsome than a mighty warrior fighting in a righteous cause.<br1>
<br> To arms! When you're ready to fight, come see me again.<br1>
