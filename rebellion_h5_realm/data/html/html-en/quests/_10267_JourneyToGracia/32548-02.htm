	<br> Are you one of the soldiers from Aden? You deserve a reward<br>
	simply for coming such a long way to help us.<br>
	<br> Unfortunately, things are happening very quickly here, and<br>
	I'm afraid I don't have the luxury for long conversations.<br>
	<br> Even as we speak, monsters unlike any we've ever seen or<br>
	heard of are wreaking havoc on my people. They seem to be filled with<br>
	insane hatred toward all humanoids.<br>
	<br> But if you have the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL"> will and skill to fight them</font>, even these<br>
	enemies can be defeated. I ask for nothing else. Nothing is more<br>
	fearsome than a mighty warrior fighting in a righteous cause.<br>
	<br> To arms! When you're ready to fight, come see me again.<br>
