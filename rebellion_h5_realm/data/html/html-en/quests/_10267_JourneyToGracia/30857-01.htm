	High Priest Orve$1<br>
	<br> Do you know the tragedy that has befallen<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Gracia</font>? The power of Shilen, the Goddess of<br>
	Death, has manifested itself in the form of a<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Seed</font> that has transformed the entire<br>
	continent into a land of death. Despite the valiant efforts by a few<br>
	lords and their warriors, most of Gracia is chaos and evil.<br>
	<br>Do you know what this means? When<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Gracia has fallen completely into evil, Aden<br>
		will be targeted next</font>. Our leaders met in what is being called the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Giran Assembly</font> and decided we must face this<br>
	threat as a unified group. The Kamael were finally welcomed into the<br>
	alliance at that time.<br>
	<br> Now we need brave adventurers to fight this rising tide of<br>
	darkness. Please help!<br>
