<font color="FF8000"><html><body>	High Priest Orven:</font><br>
<br> Do you know the tragedy that has befallen	<font color="LEVEL">Gracia</font>? The power of Shilen, the Goddess of	Death, has manifested itself in the form of a	<font color="LEVEL">Seed</font> that has transformed the entire	continent into a land of death.<br1>
Despite the valiant efforts by a few	lords and their warriors, most of Gracia is chaos and evil.<br1>
<br>Do you know what this means? When	<font color="LEVEL">Gracia has fallen completely into evil, Aden		will be targeted next</font>.<br1>
Our leaders met in what is being called the	<font color="LEVEL">Giran Assembly</font> and decided we must face this	threat as a unified group.<br1>
The Kamael were finally welcomed into the	alliance at that time.<br1>
<br> Now we need brave adventurers to fight this rising tide of	darkness.<br1>
Please help!	<br>	<a action="bypass -h Quest _10267_JourneyToGracia 30857-02.<br1>
