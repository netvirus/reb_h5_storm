	High Priest Orve$1<br>
	<br> The story begins long ago, during the Elmoreden era. Emperor<br>
	Shunaiman drove out all of Shilen's followers after years of hard<br>
	fighting. Some of them found their way to Gracia. There they seemed to<br>
	disappear from history for a while.<br>
	<br> Now we now they were actually infiltrating Gracian society<br>
	and politics. Then they struck openly, taking advantage of the civil<br>
	war between<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Karneia</font> and<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Kserth</font> after their father<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">King Paris'</font> failed invasion of Aden.<br>
	<br> Soon, Shilen's followers dominated Gracia. Clearly they had<br>
	long prepared for this moment.<br>
