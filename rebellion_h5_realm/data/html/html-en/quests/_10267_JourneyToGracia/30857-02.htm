<br> The story begins long ago, during the Elmoreden era.<br1>
Emperor	Shunaiman drove out all of Shilen's followers after years of hard	fighting.<br1>
Some of them found their way to Gracia.<br1>
There they seemed to	disappear from history for a while.<br1>
<br> Now we now they were actually infiltrating Gracian society	and politics.<br1>
Then they struck openly, taking advantage of the civil	war between	<font color="LEVEL">Karneia</font> and	<font color="LEVEL">Kserth</font> after their father	<font color="LEVEL">King Paris'</font> failed invasion of Aden.<br1>
<br> Soon, Shilen's followers dominated Gracia.<br1>
Clearly they had	long prepared for this moment.<br1>
