The beads of obedience allowed me to create aSeal of Light.<br1>
Could you possibly help me some more? Enfeux is in thedeepest part of the Valley of Saints.<br1>
It's marked on this Map.<br1>
You cantake it with you.<br1>
To extract the remains of saints, you must insert thisSeal of Light into the space to the right side of Enfeux.<br1>
Afteractivating it with the seal, you can take out the remains of saints.<br1>
Ihope you can bring back as many as possible, but remember, the Seal ofLight can be used only once.<br1>
