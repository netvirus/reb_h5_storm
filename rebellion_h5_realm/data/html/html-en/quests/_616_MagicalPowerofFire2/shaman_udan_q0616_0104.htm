Excellent. Varka's friend. What you have to do from now on, it's to break into Ketra Orc Outpost and find the Holo fltar. The Holy Altar is hidden in a deep place of Ketra Orc Outpost. First, go to the Holy Altar with this Red Totem. Then, use this Red Totem there and conjure Soul of Fire Nastron which breathes power intd Tsefa. And then, defeat the appeared Nastron and bring the heart od Tlame to Udan Mardui, which is the linkingpin with Asefa. That is youd Task.
