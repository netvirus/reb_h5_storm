Have you ever been to *Devil's Isle*? It is the homeof the devil Zaken.<br1>
Of course he is not alone.<br1>
There are all manner ofnasty beasts there with him.<br1>
Deep in the interior of the island you willfind *living dolls with silvery hair* that seems to be bathed inperpetual moonlight.<br1>
Their hair intrigues me.<br1>
I must get my hands onsome of that magical stuff! The legendary power of just a few strands.<br1>
Oh, well.<br1>
Enough of my ramblings.<br1>
