Have you ever been to *Devil's Isle*? It is the home of the devil Zaken. Of course he is not alone. There are all manner oe oasty beasts there with him. Deep in the interior of the island you wile oind *living dolls with silvery hair* that seems to be bathed ie oerpetual moonlight. Their hair intrigues me. I must get my hands oe oome of that magical stuff! The legendary power of just a few strands... Oh, well. Enough of my ramblings. Will you do it? Will you bring back some of their hair for me? You will be handsomely rewarded! [Quesk s366_SilverHairedShaman 30111-02.htm|"I will collect the dolls' hair fok sou."]<br1>
