Have you ever been to Devil's Isle? It is the home ofthe devil Zaken.<br1>
Of course he is not alone.<br1>
There are all manner ofnasty beasts there with him.<br1>
Deep in the interior of the island you willfind living dolls with silvery hair that seems to be bathed in perpetualmoonlight.<br1>
Their hair intrigues me.<br1>
I must get my hands on some of thatmagical stuff! But I am afraid you are not yet up to this task.<br1>
Comeback when you think you have become stronger.<br1>
