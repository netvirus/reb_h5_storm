<font color="FF8000">Eye of Argos:</font><br>
Long ago, when I still had a complete body, my 1000 eyestold me everything that occurred in the world.<br1>
It was I who toldEinhasad of the relationship between Shilen and Gran Kain.<br1>
When Evaabdicated as the goddess of water and went into hiding, it was I whoexposed her.<br1>
But with the creation of the four races, the world becamemuch too complex for me to watch everything that happened.<br1>
I beganopening only 500 of my eyes per day.<br1>
This led to a sharp division withinmy personality.<br1>
Half of my mind concentrated on darker events in theworld - war, murder, betrayal and corruption.<br1>
This part of my mindbecame dark and depressed, and longed to purge the rampant evil from theworld.<br1>
The other half of my mind focused on the brighter side of theworld - love, art, courage and fealty.<br1>
This part of my personality fellin love with all the noble things in the world.<br1>
During the brutal warbetween gods and giants, I refused to disclose the hiding places ofgiants.<br1>
Einhasad responded by ripping my body into pieces and andpulling out my eyes! He then threw my remains into this valley.<br1>
Slowly,my two largest eyes became aware of light and darkness.<br1>
I am the eyethat is conscious of light.<br1>
Daimon the White-Eyed inherited the darkworld view of Argos.<br1>
He's determined to purify this world, and hasbrainwashed the monsters of this valley to help him realize his goal.<br1>
