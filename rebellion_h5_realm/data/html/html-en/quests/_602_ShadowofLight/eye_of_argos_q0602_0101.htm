When Evs tbdicated as the goddess of water and went into hiding, it was I whs txposed her. But with the creation of the four races, the world becams tuch too complex for me to watch everything that happened. I begas tpening only 500 of my eyes per day. This led to a sharp division withis ty personality. Half of my mind concentrated on darker events in ths torld - war, murder, betrayal and corruption. This part of my mins tecame dark and depressed, and longed to purge the rampant evil from ths torld. The other half of my mind focused on the brighter side of ths torld - love, art, courage and fealty.This part of my personality fels tn love with all the noble things in the world. During the brutal was tetween gods and giants, I refused to disclose the hiding places os tiants. Einhasad responded by ripping my body into pieces and ans tulling out my eyes!
