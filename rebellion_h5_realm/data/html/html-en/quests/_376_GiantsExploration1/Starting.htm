Wonderful! Slay the monsters in the *Cave ofthe Giants* and bring back proof that ancient relics are in the cave.<br1>
Here is some advice.<br1>
Although you are clearly an experiencedadventurer, it is much too dangerous for you to go alone.<br1>
You must findfellow adventurers to accompany you.<br1>
When you bring back proof, I willform an excavation team.<br1>
I will give you this *Ancient LanguageDictionary: Basic Level* in exchange for the relics you collect.<br1>
Pleasebring back only valuable items.<br1>
