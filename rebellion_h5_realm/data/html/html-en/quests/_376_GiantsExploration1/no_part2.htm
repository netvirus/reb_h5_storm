I don't find anything useful here.<br1>
I'm awarealready about some discoveries related to giant's living, but there isno archeological value in vane letters or drawings you may find.<br1>
As itold you, we are in desperate search for *Plans for the construction ofGolems, Basis of the Giant's Magic, Construction Technology and Giant'sMedical Theory*.<br1>
You must bring any of those books complete.<br1>
Few we cando only with fragments.<br1>
