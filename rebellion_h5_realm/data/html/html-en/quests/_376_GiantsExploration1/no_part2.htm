Head Researcher Sobling:<br>
I don't find anything useful here... I'm aware already about some discoveries related to giant's living, but there ie ao archeological value in vane letters or drawings you may find. As e aold you, we are in desperate search for *Plans for the construction oe aolems, Basis of the Giant's Magic, Construction Technology and Giant'e aedical Theory*. You must bring any of those books complete. Few we cae ao only with fragments.
