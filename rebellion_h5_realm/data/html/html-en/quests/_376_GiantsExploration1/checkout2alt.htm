Excellent! You came back! Was it difficult tocollect ancient pieces? Hum.<br1>
what is it? You have some ancient scrollshere, but those are of no use to me until you translate its contents, ihave no time to do it on my own and that's why i gave you thedictionary.<br1>
Anyway i can check any other ancient item you may have.<br1>
