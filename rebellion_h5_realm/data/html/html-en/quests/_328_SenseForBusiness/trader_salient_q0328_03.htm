Deal! Spit on the ground and let's shake on it.<br1>
Withthis, our contract is sealed in the eyes of the goddess of earth, Maphr.<br1>
Now listen to what I have to say.<br1>
Do you remember the eight basicingredients used for my magic research that I told you about earlier? Wecan find some of them in this area.<br1>
If you'll hunt for *monster eyes*,you can get their useful *Monster Eye Carcasses,* and once in a while,you may even obtain a *Monster Eye Lens*.<br1>
This is a very valuable item.<br1>
They say Dwarves use these to make something called "eye glasses.<br1>
" Also,if you hunt the *Basilisk*, you can get its gizzard.<br1>
The Basiliskswallows the pebbles of the wastelands to aid its digestion, but inside,they are mixed with jade shards.<br1>
So we can obtain jade from the*basilisk gizzard*.<br1>
You can find monster eyes at the bends of the Ruinsof Agony or the Ruins of Despair.<br1>
The basilisk can be found within theWastelands.<br1>
There are also monster eyes in the Wastelands, but they aremuch more dangerous than those at the bends of the Ruins, so you must becareful.<br1>
But you may be able to find items that are that much moreprecious, so it is worth taking the challenge.<br1>
From now on, the itemsyou bring to me I will sell to the Ivory Tower.<br1>
I have already signed aContract with the magicians of the Ivory Tower and fixed the price aswell.<br1>
I will give you 30% of the item price I have agreed to take.<br1>
Soplease bring back as much as possible.<br1>
Well then, may the blessing ofthe earth be with you, partner.<br1>
