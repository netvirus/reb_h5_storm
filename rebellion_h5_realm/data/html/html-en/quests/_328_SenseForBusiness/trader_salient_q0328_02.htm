I know it is hard to believe, but a long time agosouthern Gludio also used to be fertile farmland.<br1>
However, as you cansee, now it is nothing more than barren wastelands.<br1>
It may seem likebarren land to normal people, but true businessmen like me findopportunities in any place.<br1>
In the end, I was able to find somethingvaluable in these Wastelands that could not be found elsewhere.<br1>
Therefore I have decided to begin a *new business* here.<br1>
I would like tohave a reliable partner.<br1>
