I know it is hard to believe, but a long time agosouthern Gludio also used to be fertile farmland.<br1>
However, as you cansee, now it is nothing more than barren wasteland.<br1>
It may seem likebarren land to normal people, but true businessmen like me findopportunities in any place.<br1>
I believe there are valuable commodities tobe found here in the Wastelands that cannot be found elsewhere.<br1>
If I amable to find them, I may begin a *new business* here.<br1>
When that timecomes, I may need your help.<br1>
