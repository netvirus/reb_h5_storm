My thanks for the supplies.<br1>
I now needyou to deliver them to where they are needed most.<br1>
Travel through the*Mining Zone Passage* that you will south of here.<br1>
From there, you willcome to see the Plunderous Plains.<br1>
Once there, you should easily findthe *Train Station* that we Dwarves originally built.<br1>
Find RailroadWorker Obi and give these supplies to him.<br1>
It is a long journey, andthere are a few people to see along the way.<br1>
If your devotion wanes,just think back to all of our guildsmen who are waiting for thesesupplies and how much they are counting on you.<br1>
