I have no hidden motive.<br1>
You and I share a common goal.<br1>
And THATmakes us partners.<br1>
You are most honored by it.<br1>
Have you figured outhow to withstand her deadliest magic? As partners, I'll tell you.<br1>
Usefrozen core, and her eternal blizzard magic will feel like a slushy.<br1>
Wait until Freya casts that magic, and then use the frozen core rightaway.<br1>
Well, those frozen cores I mentioned can make that deadly magicfeel like a soft winter snow.<br1>
Next time you fight her, wait until shetries to cast the spell and immediately use the frozen core when youstart to feel the cold.<br1>
Ah, I wish I could see the look on her face whenher power proves useless.<br1>
