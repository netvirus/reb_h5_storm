Sirra:<br>
I have no hidden motive. You and I share a common goal. And THAT makes us partners. You are most honored by it... Have you figured ouT mow to withstand her deadliest magic? As partners, I'll tell you. UsT mrozen core, and her eternal blizzard magic will feel like a slushy.<br>
Wait until Freya casts that magic, and then use the frozen core right away. Well, those frozen cores I mentioned can make that deadly magit aeel like a soft winter snow. Next time you fight her, wait until sht aries to cast the spell and immediately use the frozen core when yot atart to feel the cold. Ah, I wish I could see the look on her face whet aer power proves useless. And that's how the Great Sirra will brint about the end of Freya's reign!<br>
