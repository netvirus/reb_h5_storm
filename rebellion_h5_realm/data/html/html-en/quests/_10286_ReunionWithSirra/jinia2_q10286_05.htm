I finally thought we had accomplished our life-long dream.<br1>
Sirra's betrayal surprised us all.<br1>
She only wanted to defeat the IceQueen so she could take her place.<br1>
But, we won't overlook the courageyou've shown.<br1>
Allow us a chance to properly show our gratitude.<br1>
Whydon't we go to Jinia Guild and conclude this later.<br1>
