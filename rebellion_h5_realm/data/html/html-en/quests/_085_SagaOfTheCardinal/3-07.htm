Each tribe has a chief shaman who also serves as aguide of dead souls.<br1>
Asefa serves the Ketra Orcs and Udan Mardui servesthe Varka Silenos.<br1>
Each one possesses a* Divine Stone of Wisdom*.<br1>
Theyare vaguely aware of its power, but have no idea how to use it.<br1>
Theyactually give it away as a prize to whomever they consider the wisest oftheir respective tribes.<br1>
You must gain their trust and get the stone!Bring it to me, and I'll combine it with the stone that Agnes gave me tocreate a Stone of Commune.<br1>
The Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos arecurrently at war with each other, so you must choose which tribe toapproach.<br1>
