Countless thoughts beyond comprehension searpainfully into your brain.<br1>
Images twist inside my mind until theyfinally slow down and I begin to see something familiar.<br1>

I see thenext Tablet to find The background of the Tablet resembles* the North ofBorder Outpost*.<br1>
The Stone of Commune cannot be far though I cannotdiscern its exact location.<br1>
It looks like Haures whom I recognize froma picture is a book.<br1>
I peer at it closer, but the visions fade.<br1>
