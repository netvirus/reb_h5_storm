Hello! I've been expecting you! Don't look sosurprised! You're here for the Stone of Commune, aren't you? I got thisone from Agnes a while back.<br1>
Don't you wonder how she got it and why shegave it to me? If you knew her, you'd understand! While you were away,there was an accident in Goddard Castle Town.<br1>
Agnes provided food forthe townspeople, and after the accident, everyone, including myself,came to rely upon her.<br1>
The stone you seek isn't perfect.<br1>
When she gaveme this one, she said she needed another, more powerful one.<br1>
