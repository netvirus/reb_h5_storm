While clearing out the library's undergroundwarehouse one day, I discovered a very old, very worn-out book filledwith snatches of some unkown ancient language.<br1>
I have tried to translateit without success, but I recently learned that this book is veryvaluable.<br1>
I am looking for an adventurer who can transport it toPrimeval Isle, but I don't think that you're the right person for thejob.<br1>
No offense! I know it sounds like an easy task, but the island is aplace filled with peril.<br1>
I need someone with more.<br1>
experience toundertake this mission.<br1>
