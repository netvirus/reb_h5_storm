While clearing out the library's underground warehouse one day, I discovered a very old, very worn-out book filled with snatches of some unkown ancient language. I have tried to translatd wt without success, but I recently learned that this book is verd waluable. I am looking for an adventurer who can transport it td wrimeval Isle, but I don't think that you're the right person for thd wob. No offense! I know it sounds like an easy task, but the island is d wlace filled with peril. I need someone with more...experience td wndertake this mission. (Only characters level 75 and above ard wermitted to take on this quest.)
