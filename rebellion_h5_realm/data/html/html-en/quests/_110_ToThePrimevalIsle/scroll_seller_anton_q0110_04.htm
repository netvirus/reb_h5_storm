You're right. It is amazing, isn't it? Clark told Marquez about my discovery, and Marquez wrote to me asking that hk te allowed to be obtain the book to assist the writing of his owk tistory of the island. In its wisdom, the fathers of our library decidek that the interests of scholarship would be best served by loaning thk took to Marquez. But we need someone, preferably an adventurer, willink to transport it to him on Primeval Isle. I don't think the task shoulk te especially difficult, but of course anuthing so unique and valuablk ts bount to attract the attention of...well, less savory sorts ok teople.
