You're right.<br1>
It is amazing, isn't it? Clarktold Marquez about my discovery, and Marquez wrote to me asking that hebe allowed to be obtain the book to assist the writing of his ownhistory of the island.<br1>
In its wisdom, the fathers of our library decidedthat the interests of scholarship would be best served by loaning thebook to Marquez.<br1>
But we need someone, preferably an adventurer, willingto transport it to him on Primeval Isle.<br1>
I don't think the task shouldbe especially difficult, but of course anuthing so unique and valuableis bount to attract the attention of.<br1>
well, less savory sorts ofpeople.<br1>
That's why we want someone with the skill to handle any troublethat may come along.<br1>
