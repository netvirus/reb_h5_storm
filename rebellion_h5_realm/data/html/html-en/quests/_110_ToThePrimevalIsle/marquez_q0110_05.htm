Excellent! I see in you the spirit of my younger days! Verywell, let me begin: *In the days of old*, when the circle of the godswas broken, countless races were spawned from that circle.<br1>
The greatestof them were the gods themselves; the next greatest were the Giants.<br1>
Andthe gods gave the Giants authority to rule over the world.<br1>
All scholarsknow this story, but in these days men wonder what has become of allcreatures brought forth into the world at the breaking of the circle.<br1>
Aninteresting beginnig, eh? Clearly this was a learned author; perhaps Iwill discover in its pages new knowledge about ancient Primeval Isle.<br1>
Ican hardly wait to begin my translation! Thank you for bringing thisprize to me.<br1>
