Have you heard of the book entitled Traces ofLiving Beings in Ancient Times? While clearing out the library'sunderground warehouse one day, I discovered a very old, very worn-outbook filed with snatches of some ancient language.<br1>
Believe me when Itell you that my years of working here have made me pretty familiar withmost of the ancient tongues, but this language is tatally strange to me.<br1>
I hope to be able to eventually translete it, but right now it has mecompletely stymied! In any event, I placed it on my shelf and, to mychagrin, eventually forgot about it.<br1>
