A few days ago, Clark -- the most avid readerin all Rune Town -- stopped by andasket to see all the books I hadcleared out from the underground warehouse.<br1>
He seemed to beknowledgeable about the subject, so I showed this ancient book to him.<br1>
You should have seen Clark's face! he cried out and grasped the book tohim as though he was embracing a log-lost friend.<br1>
He told me that, longago, he was a member of the original Primeval Isle Expedition and aclose friendof the expedition's leader, Captain Marquez.<br1>
This book, hetold me, is the only one of its kind.<br1>
It contains much of the mythologyand history of the Primeval Isle.<br1>
Marquez himself has searched for itfor years, but had all but given up hope of ever finding it.<br1>
