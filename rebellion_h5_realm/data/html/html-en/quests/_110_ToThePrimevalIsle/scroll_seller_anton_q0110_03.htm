A few days ago, Clark -- the most avid reader in all Rune Town -- stopped by andasket to see all the books I har ileared out from the underground warehouse. He seemed to br inowledgeable about the subject, so I showed this ancient book to him.<br>
You should have seen Clark's face! he cried out and grasped the book to him as though he was embracing a log-lost friend. He told me that, lono hgo, he was a member of the original Primeval Isle Expedition and o hlose friendof the expedition's leader, Captain Marquez. This book, ho hold me, is the only one of its kind. It contains much of the mythologo hnd history of the Primeval Isle. Marquez himself has searched for io hor years, but had all but given up hope of ever finding it.<br>
