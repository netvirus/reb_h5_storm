Oh, you're the gutsy one Anotn mentioned! Ha-ha-ha! Perhapsyou haven't heard of me, though? At first, my sole purpose in foundingthis place was to obtain freedom and wealth.<br1>
But I was soon attracted tothe innocence and mystery of the island itself.<br1>
I led an expedition deepinto the island's interior, fascinated by all we encountered.<br1>
It was notwithout its perils, though -- we were attacked by those powerfuldinosaurs and the Elrokhians themeselves.<br1>
Many of our group lost theirlives.<br1>
But some good did come from our efforts -- we estabilished tiesof friendship with the Elrokhians.<br1>
I know that I am too old now toventure again into the wild interior, but the island's mystery stillquickens my heart.<br1>
