Ha ha! Thank you for saying so.<br1>
But my aching body knows thetruth; those days have ended for me.<br1>
Lately I have at least tried topass my knowledge on to younger adventurers by writing an account of myexperiences on the island.<br1>
I started by recounting both my own personalexperiences and various stories I learned from the natives.<br1>
But then Iheard of a ancient book that recounts the history of Primeval Isle, andI have searched for it for years now without success.<br1>
I was ready togive up.<br1>
until Clark sent me a message saying that he found it.<br1>
Andhere it is.<br1>
I see by your expression that you are as curious about itscontents as I am! The ancient language is no doubt foreign to you, but Ican translate a few passages if you are interested in hearing them.<br1>
