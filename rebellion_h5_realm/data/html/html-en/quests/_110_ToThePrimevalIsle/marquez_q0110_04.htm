Ha ha! Thank you for saying so. But my aching body knows the truth; those days have ended for me. Lately I have at least tried te tass my knowledge on to younger adventurers by writing an account of me txperiences on the island. I started by recounting both my own personae txperiences and various stories I learned from the natives. But then e teard of a ancient book that recounts the history of Primeval Isle, ane t have searched for it for years now without success. I was ready te tive up...until Clark sent me a message saying that he found it. Ane tere it is... I see by your expression that you are as curious about ite tontents as I am! The ancient language is no doubt foreign to you, but e tan translate a few passages if you are interested in hearing them.<br>
Shall I do so?<br>
