The poisons of the plains caused the Leto to die off,and what Leto didn't die began to.<br1>
evolve, if you could call it that.<br1>
They have become a new species, calling themselves the Tanta.<br1>
Only Idoubt poison alone could do that, so it must be magic too.<br1>
The poorLeto.<br1>
they had no choice in the matter.<br1>
A group of investigators weresent to look into the matter months ago.<br1>
We haven't heard anything backfrom them, though, and my duties keep me from handling the situationpersonally.<br1>
Could you do me a favor and talk to the Chief Investigatorfor me? His name is Johnny.<br1>
