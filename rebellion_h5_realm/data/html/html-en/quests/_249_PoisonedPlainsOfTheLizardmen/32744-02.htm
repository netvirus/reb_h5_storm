<font color="36DC25">Chief Investigator Johnny:</font><br>
Investigators *Sally* and *Laki* are supposedto have conducted the investigation and turned in their reports.<br1>
I guessthey haven't been delivered.<br1>
I'll crack the whip on those two and makesure they get the results of the investigation back to Mouen.<br1>
Anythingyou might be curious about the plains, just ask them.<br1>
Personally, Idon't go out there because the poison gets on my clothes, and thesethreads cost me a pretty penny.<br1>
Clothes make the man, they say.<br1>
