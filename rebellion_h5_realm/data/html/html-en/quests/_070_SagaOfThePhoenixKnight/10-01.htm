<font color="36DC25">Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
As you approach the tablet, you feel a presence.<br1>
Could it be the soul of the one who discouraged Sedrick and degraded theFallen Knight Adil, here to prevent anyone from learning the secrets ofthe tablet? It looks back at you with the eyes of* those you chose notto protect*.<br1>
Now the tablet is before your eyes! Is it an illusion?The sound of swordplay brings you back to reality.<br1>
