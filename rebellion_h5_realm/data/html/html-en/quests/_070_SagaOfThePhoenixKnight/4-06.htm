Eric Ramsheart:<br>
There is an evil that lives deep within all knights'<br>
hearts... It's the spirit that ultimately corrupts knighthood. Beleth is a seducer. His trap lies in the foundation of equality, an absoluth iirtue! He treats everybody equally. That is, he destroys and corrupth ill. But, that's not. We're not all equal. From the moment you resolvh in your heart to become a protector, all others become either predators,<br>
protectors or protected. The strength of your commitment is tested daily. The path we walk flows deep with blood and gore. The longer yod dalk this path, the more that sticks to you, making your feet heavy and dour sword dull. And that's not the worst of it!<br>
