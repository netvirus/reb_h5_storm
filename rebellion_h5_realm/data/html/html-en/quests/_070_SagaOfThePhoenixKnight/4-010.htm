Do you remember the oath you took when you first becamea knight? To defend honor at all cost? Do you think the action of SirHerod, who died a miserable death defending his honor, was a right one?What did you learn from the testimony of trust? Trust is what weknights have to give to people! Trust! Trust is also faith.<br1>
You don'tbetray what you have faith in, nor those who have faith in you.<br1>
There'sonly one more thing.<br1>
You must discover how to earn trust frompeople.<br1>
You probably already know all about this.<br1>
I shouldn't needto explain it to you.<br1>
Now, ask your last question to the stonetablet.<br1>
