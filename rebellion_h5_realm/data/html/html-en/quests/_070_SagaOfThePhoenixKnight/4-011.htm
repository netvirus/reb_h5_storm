Do you remember the oath you took when you first becamea knight? To defend honor at all cost? Do you think the actions of SirHerod, who died a miserable death defending his honor, were right? Whatdid you learn from the testimony of trust? Trust is all we knightshave to offer! Trust also means faith.<br1>
You don't betray what you havefaith in, nor those who have faith in you.<br1>
There's only one morething.<br1>
You must discover how to earn trust from people.<br1>
Youprobably already know all about this.<br1>
I shouldn't need to explain it toyou.<br1>
Now, ask your last question to the stone tablet.<br1>
