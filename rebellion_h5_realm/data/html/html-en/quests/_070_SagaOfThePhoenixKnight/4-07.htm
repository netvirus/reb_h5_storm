There is an evil that lives deep within all knights'hearts.<br1>
It's the spirit that ultimately corrupts knighthood.<br1>
Belethis a seducer.<br1>
His trap lies in the foundation of equality, an absolutevirtue! He treats everybody equally.<br1>
That is, he destroys and corruptsall.<br1>
But, we're not all equal.<br1>
From the moment you resolve in yourheart to become a protector, all others become either predators,protectors or protected.<br1>
The strength of your commitment is testeddaily.<br1>
The path we walk flows deep with blood and gore.<br1>
The longer youwalk this path, the more that sticks to you, making your feet heavy andyour sword dull.<br1>
