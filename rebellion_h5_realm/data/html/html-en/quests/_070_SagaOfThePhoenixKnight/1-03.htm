Here's the ice crystal.<br1>
and, a fat white fish! You'vebrought both of them! The dish is very simple.<br1>
This fish contains coldair.<br1>
Cut it carefully into thin slices and wrap them around icecrystals.<br1>
It makes a great sushi! It perfectly enhances the chill ofthe ice crystal and spreads the cold air around it.<br1>
Use the scales towrap it up and seal it.<br1>
This dish is called Ice Cold Flower.<br1>
