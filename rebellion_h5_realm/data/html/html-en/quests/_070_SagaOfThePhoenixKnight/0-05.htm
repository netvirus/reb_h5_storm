<font color="FF8000">Grand Master Sedrick:</font><br>
Long ago, a peasant revolt broke out in a smallvillage in Dion Territory.<br1>
When talks failed, the local manor lordresorted to force.<br1>
Obeying their orders, the top Knights of the guildfought for him.<br1>
However, many young Knights followed their conscienceand sided with the peasants.<br1>
The order was split, each side feelingrighteous.<br1>
I wonder if either side was right.<br1>
* Could a Knight just bedefending his ego? There is no such thing as true justice.<br1>
