So Mirabel said to ask *Trader Herbiel*?<br1>
He is Greenis' uncle, of course, but it would be awkward for me to approach him on so...sensitive...a subject.<br1>
But if Mirabel thinks he can help... Perhaps you would be willing to speak with him for me?<br1>
Please show him my letter, then hurry back and give me his advice!
