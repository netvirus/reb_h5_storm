Arujien:<br>
Have you ever been in love?<br1>
Have you ever felt your heart leap at the sight of your beloved, or your pulse race at the sound of her voice?<br1>
I can think of nothing else; I cannot eat or sleep or even work!<br>
But I lack the courage to confess my feelings, so I suffer in silence.<br1>
But I must know! I have decided to pour my heart out to her in a letter, but who will deliver it for me?<br1>
It must be someone trustworthy -- this is too important to entrust to just anyone!<br1>
