Again!? Sigh.<br1>
Every year around this time, somepoor soul always seems to fall head-over-heels for sister.<br1>
But what doesany of this have to do with me? I have no idea what my sister thinks ofArujien or anyone else; from what I can tell, her heart has never beenwarmed by thoughts of love and romance.<br1>
Perhaps I'm mistaken, though --Greenis and I have never been particularly close, and I'm probably thelast person she would confide in.<br1>
Perhaps my Uncle *Herbiel* would knowmore.<br1>
He raised us like his own children, after all.<br1>
