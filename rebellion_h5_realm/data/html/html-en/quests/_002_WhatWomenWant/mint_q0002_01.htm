Gatekeeper Mirabel:<br>
Again!?<br1>
Sigh... Every year around this time, some poor soul always seems to fall head-over-heels for sister.<br1>
But what does any of this have to do with me?<br1>
I have no idea what my sister thinks of Arujien or anyone else, from what I can tell, her heart has never been  warmed by thoughts of love and romance.<br1>
Perhaps I'm mistaken, though -- Greenis and I have never been particularly close, and I'm probably the last person she would confide in.<br1>
Perhaps my Uncle *Herbiel* would know more.<br1>
He raised us like his own children, after all.
