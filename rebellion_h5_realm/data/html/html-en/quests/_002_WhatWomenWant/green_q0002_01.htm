My niece Greenis?<br1>
Yes, I raised her and her sister after my brother and his wife were killed.<br1>
She is a woman now, of course, but still as innocent as a child about the ways of the world.<br>
Arujien, eh? A fine lad, though a tad cautious.<br1>
Still, I'm sure he and Greenis would be a good match.<br1>
I can't imagine that she would object...
