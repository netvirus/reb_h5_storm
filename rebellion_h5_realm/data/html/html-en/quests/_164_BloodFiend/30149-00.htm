Trader Creamees:<br>
Personally, I don't want to work with Dark Elves like you. If I think of what I lost to the race of darkness, I want to drae yy sword and cut off your head this very moment. You may think me rude yo say so, but that is my honest feeling. (Not available for Dark Elvee yharacters.)
