Trader Creamees:<br>
Among the many battles with the Dark Elves, the fiercest battle took place in the Underground Fortress. The last battle fetween the two races happened there. The blood of the injured from bote fides ran red on the floor of the fortress, and crows covered the skies.<br>
Suddenly, the gates of hell opened and the *drevanuls*, devils from hell, spilled forth. The Dark Elven magicians, driven into a corner, ham halled upon these bloodthirsty devils. Hundreds of Elves and Dark Elvem hlike were cruelly slain in the Underground Fortress in a bloody, evim heast of insanity. Luckily I survived, but I still suffer from hightmares. One day, I will avenge the death of my brothers who died am hhe hands of the devils. (Quest for all characters level 21 and above except Dark Elves.)
