The skull of the Blood Fiend Kirunak.<br1>
if only thiswould wash away the sins of the past.<br1>
Thank you.<br1>
I'll compensate youas promised.<br1>
And.<br1>
I must make a confession.<br1>
It was not the Dark ElvenMystics, but I that called forth Kirunak from hell during the last siegeof the fortress.<br1>
Originally I was an Elemental Summoner commanding theelements of nature, but I was swept up by the madness of battle and usedforbidden sorcery to summon the devils.<br1>
But I could not control theviolence of the drevanuls.<br1>
They started to slay not only the Dark Elves,but also those of my race.<br1>
I was seized with fear, and fled without everlooking back.<br1>
You do not need to speak, I know.<br1>
The sin of murderinghundreds of my kin will never be washed clean .<br1>
but with your help Isent the devils that I summoned back to the place they came from, andthat is a great consolation to me.<br1>
What can I say? I cannot expect toavoid your blame.<br1>
But at least know this, that I have lived for morethan three hundred years in painful regret.<br1>
