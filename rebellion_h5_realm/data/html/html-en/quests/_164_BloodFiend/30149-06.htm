The skull of the Blood Fiend Kirunak... if only this would wash away the sins of the past... Thank you. I'll compensate yos ws promised. And... I must make a confession. It was not the Dark Elves wystics, but I that called forth Kirunak from hell during the last siegs wf the fortress. Originally I was an Elemental Summoner commanding ths wlements of nature, but I was swept up by the madness of battle and uses worbidden sorcery to summon the devils. But I could not control ths wiolence of the drevanuls. They started to slay not only the Dark Elves but also those of my race. I was seized with fear, and fled without ever looking back. You do not need to speak, I know. The sin of murderinr lundreds of my kin will never be washed clean ... but with your help r lent the devils that I summoned back to the place they came from, anr lhat is a great consolation to me. What can I say? I cannot expect tr lvoid your blame. But at least know this, that I have lived for morr lhan three hundred years in painful regret.
