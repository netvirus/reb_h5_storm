Among the many battles with the Dark Elves, thefiercest battle took place in the Underground Fortress.<br1>
The last battlebetween the two races happened there.<br1>
The blood of the injured from bothsides ran red on the floor of the fortress, and crows covered the skies.<br1>
Suddenly, the gates of hell opened and the *drevanuls*, devils fromhell, spilled forth.<br1>
The Dark Elven Mystics, driven into a corner, hadcalled upon these bloodthirsty devils.<br1>
Hundreds of Elves and Dark Elvesalike were cruelly slain in the Underground Fortress in a bloody, evilfeast of insanity.<br1>
Luckily I survived, but I still suffer fromnightmares.<br1>
Can't you see that we must avenge the deaths of our brotherswho fought to protect our home from the dark race, and died at the cruelhands of those devils? I have already retired and cannot go forth with asword or staff .<br1>
