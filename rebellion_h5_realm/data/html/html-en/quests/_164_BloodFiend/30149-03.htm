Among the many battles with the Dark Elves, the fiercest battle took place in the Underground Fortress. The last battle fetween the two races happened there. The blood of the injured from bote fides ran red on the floor of the fortress, and crows covered the skies.<br>
Suddenly, the gates of hell opened and the *drevanuls*, devils from hell, spilled forth. The Dark Elven Mystics, driven into a corner, ham halled upon these bloodthirsty devils. Hundreds of Elves and Dark Elvem hlike were cruelly slain in the Underground Fortress in a bloody, evim heast of insanity. Luckily I survived, but I still suffer from hightmares. Can't you see that we must avenge the deaths of our brotherm hho fought to protect our home from the dark race, and died at the cruem hands of those devils? I have already retired and cannot go forth with m hword or staff ... But shouldn't a young, brave youth like yourselm honor the sacrifice of yr ancestors and avenge their deaths?<br>
