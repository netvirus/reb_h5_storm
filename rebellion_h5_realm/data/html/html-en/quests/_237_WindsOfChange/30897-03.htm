I'm serious as the grave.<br1>
What good is that landdoing completely undeveloped? Does that reed field make money? Is itbenefiting anybody at all? Dr.<br1>
Helvetica just wants to ulitize theland.<br1>
give it a purpose.<br1>
Developing on that land won't just make himmoney, it will make money for us all.<br1>
Can't you see that? The day thatAthenia's plan puts adena in my pocket will be the day that Ire-evaluate my decision.<br1>
But until that time, my patronage goes toHelvetica.<br1>
Ponder that on your way out.<br1>
