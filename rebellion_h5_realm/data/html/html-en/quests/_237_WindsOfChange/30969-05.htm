As you probably know, I am a busy man.<br1>
And I don't havethe time to address this particular matter personally.<br1>
So I want you todecide who I should support.<br1>
Go meet with the supporters of both sides,listen to their opinions and report back to me.<br1>
First, I'll set up ameeting with Head Blacksmith Roman who happens to be a supporter of Dr.<br1>
Helvetica.<br1>
After that, you'll have a meeting with High Priestess Morelynwho supports this Athenia woman.<br1>
After you have meet with these two,come back to me with your decision.<br1>
