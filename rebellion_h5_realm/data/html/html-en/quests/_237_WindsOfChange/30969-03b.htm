Are you talking about Athenia? Oh yes, I've heard abouther.<br1>
Not only is she a passionate believer of Eva, but she is also apowerful priestess who knows well about the ancient rites and rituals.<br1>
She believes that the land is something to be nurtured and protected.<br1>
She would like nothing more than to see this area reinvigorated.<br1>
Yes,it's true.<br1>
I am inclined to help her, for in helping her, I can preventthe spread of these horrible Mucrokians.<br1>
