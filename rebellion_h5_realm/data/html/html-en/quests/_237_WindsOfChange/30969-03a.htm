What can I say about Dr.<br1>
Helvetica? The only things I knowabout him are from his correspondance and idle gossip.<br1>
I've heard thathe is somewhat of a genius, finding fame and notoriety through histenure at the Pavel Laboratory.<br1>
Like Doctor Chaos, he had outgrown theconfines of such a stifflingly correct administration.<br1>
He claims to wantthe land to the north to build a research facility.<br1>
It would surely helpInnadril's development if I were to support his cause.<br1>
