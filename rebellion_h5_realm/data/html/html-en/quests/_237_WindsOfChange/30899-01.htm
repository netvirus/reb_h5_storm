This place - my home - has been untouched by thepassage of time.<br1>
But now, the winds of change have begun to blow .<br1>
even here amidst the beauty of Heine.<br1>
While change often brings with ituncertainty and even anxiety, I sense something indescribable on thewind.<br1>
Something ominous.<br1>
Something perhaps even deadly.<br1>
I hope thesefeelings of mine are wrong.<br1>
