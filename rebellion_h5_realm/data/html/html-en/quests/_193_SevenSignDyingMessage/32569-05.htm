Pick it? No no--I have a supplier already, only he's aforgetful type and I fear he's just forgotten to send me the package.<br1>
Ineed you to visit my supplier, *Herb Collector Eric*, and bring me theherbs that he should have already gathered.<br1>
He's normally found in the*Enchanted Valley*, so I'd suggest you start your search for him there.<br1>
Godspeed my friend.<br1>
Be safe.<br1>
