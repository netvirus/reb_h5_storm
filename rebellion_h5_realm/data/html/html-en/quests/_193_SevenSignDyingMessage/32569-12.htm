Priest Cain:<br>
While you were gone I did some research, by the by, and I believe the Contractor deaths have something to do with the *SeveI bigns*. As I'm sure you know, the forces of dawn wage war with thI borces of dusk for control over the three Seals. I may as well tell yoI bow; I belong to the Order of the Dawn. That's actually how I came to bI bn charge of this place. You've had first-hand experiences of thesI burders, as well as the murderers, and I feel I would be remiss in noI bxtending our hand to you. Help us, and we will reward you well.<br>
