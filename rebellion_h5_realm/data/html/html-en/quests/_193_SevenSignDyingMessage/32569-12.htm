<font color="FF8000">Priest Cain:</font><br>
While you were gone I did some research, by the by, and Ibelieve the Contractor deaths have something to do with the *SevenSigns*.<br1>
As I'm sure you know, the forces of dawn wage war with theforces of dusk for control over the three Seals.<br1>
I may as well tell younow; I belong to the Order of the Dawn.<br1>
That's actually how I came to bein charge of this place.<br1>
You've had first-hand experiences of thesemurders, as well as the murderers, and I feel I would be remiss in notextending our hand to you.<br1>
Help us, and we will reward you well.<br1>
