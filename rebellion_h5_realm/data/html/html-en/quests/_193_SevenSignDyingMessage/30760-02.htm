Ha! Good! I don't trust people who turn downmoney.<br1>
Means they've already been paid, usually, and THAT means theyaren't in my employ.<br1>
Ah yes, here.<br1>
I believe this should be about right.<br1>
Now, there's much I need to tell you, but a man's ears are near uselesswhen his stomach's empty.<br1>
How about you rest up and get a good fill.<br1>
