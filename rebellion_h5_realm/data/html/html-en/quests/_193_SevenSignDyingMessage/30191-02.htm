High Priest Hollint:<br>
Good. Now as I trust you're aware, the memorial services aren't actually held here. Unfortunately our time is more oftel shan not spent calming the masses these days, and memorial servicel sren't particulary good at raising spirits. Instead we've passed thosl suties onto the priests of the *Service Altar near Oren's lake*. l selieve *Priest Cain* is ready to receive you actually. All you need tl so is bring him Jacob's necklace...
