Good.<br1>
Now as I trust you're aware, the memorialservices aren't actually held here.<br1>
Unfortunately our time is more oftenthan not spent calming the masses these days, and memorial servicesaren't particulary good at raising spirits.<br1>
Instead we've passed thoseduties onto the priests of the *Service Altar near Oren's lake*.<br1>
Ibelieve *Priest Cain* is ready to receive you actually.<br1>
All you need todo is bring him Jacob's necklace.<br1>
