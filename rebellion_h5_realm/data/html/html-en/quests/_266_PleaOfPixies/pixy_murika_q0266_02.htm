A few days ago, the king of the birds came to my race andasked for help.<br1>
The *red keltirs* are stealing eggs from the nests ofaquatic birds, hidden in the grass, and eating them.<br1>
Also, the *graywolves* are eating the young pheasants.<br1>
So, they asked us to kill thosegreedy animals.<br1>
It is true that the keltir and the wolf only act ontheir inbred natural instinct, but we must stop them from preying on thebirds so heavily if we are to recover the balance of the forest! Ourwise queen has found the perfect solution for protecting the birds.<br1>
Wecan protect bird nests and homes by placing talismans that emit a powerkeltirs and wolves fear.<br1>
This will prevent them from approaching thebirds.<br1>
But we are having difficulties collecting the necessary materialsto create this talisman.<br1>
