You have brought me *100 fangs* as promised! Thank you!Now our queen can make the talismans to protect the birds of the forest.<br1>
I hope that the day will soon come when songbirds will sing from everytree branch.<br1>
Please don't leave yet! We *pixies* always repay any helpwe receive.<br1>
There! Take this.<br1>
