A few days ago, the king of the birds came to my race andasked for help.<br1>
*Keltirs* steal water birds' eggs hidden in the grass,while the *wolves* devour baby pheasants, and he asked us to slay thegreedy animals for him.<br1>
It is true that the *keltir* and the *wolf* onlyact on their inbred natural instincts, but we must stop them frompreying on the birds for a time, if we are to restore the balance of theforest! Right now our queen is thinking of ways to protect the birds ofthe forest.<br1>
