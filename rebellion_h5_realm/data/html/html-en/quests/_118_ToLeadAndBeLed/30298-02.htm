Blacksmith Pinter Oh, don't you worry about getting this for fee.<br1>
Nothing's for nothing, you know.<br1>
In fact, you will need to fetch meevery single piece of material required to make it! But it'll be worththe effort, I promise you.<br1>
You cant buy this kind of armor in a story.<br1>
First, you must defeat the *Maille Lizardmen* to the *south of thewillage*, and bring me *10 bottles* of their *blood*.<br1>
Their blood is theactivator in the epoxy I use for the armor.<br1>
