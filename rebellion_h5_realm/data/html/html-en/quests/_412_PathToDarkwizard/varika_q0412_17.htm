Dark Wizards can control the power of nature and performpowerful magic.<br1>
But you should be aware of the origin of power thatenables it.<br1>
Long ago, our mother Shilen was insulted by Einhasad andbetrayed by the Elves.<br1>
Since then, the origin of our power is darkness,like our mother Shilen.<br1>
Dark power consists of four factors -- anger,despair, horror and lunacy.<br1>
You can qualify to become a Dark Wizard onlyif you collect the four seeds that symbolize these four things.<br1>
