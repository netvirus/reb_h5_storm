Miner Bolter:<br>
Argh! May your beard become as sparse as a Gremlin's whiskers, you empty-headed wastrel!<br1>
You are as forgetful as Brunon...<br>
First, stop by the Weapons and Armor Shop and get a sack of Boom-boom Powder from *Trader Shari*.<br1>
Then go to the General Store and get a pair of Mining Boots from *Trader Garita*.<br1>
After that, go to the Warehouse and get us a case of Redstone Beer from *Warehouse Chief Reed*.<br1>
Finally, pick up a Miner's Pick from *Blacksmith Brunon*.
