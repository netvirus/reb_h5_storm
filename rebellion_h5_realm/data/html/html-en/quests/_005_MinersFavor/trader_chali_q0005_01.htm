Bolter sent you, eh?<br1>
Lessee here...oh, he ordered some *Boomboom Powder* a few days ago.<br1>
Last time he used too much while trying to blast a new mine entrance and singed his beard!<br1>
Hopefully he'll be more careful with this batch.<br1>
Here you go: 1 sack of Boomboom Powder. Please don't drop it!
