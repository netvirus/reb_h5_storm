Miner Bolter:<br>
Here's a list of the supplies we need. Let's see... Ah!<br1>
First, stop by the Weapons and Armor Shop and get a sack of Boom-boom Powder from *Trader Shari*.<br1>
Then go to the General Store and get a pair of Mining Boots from *Trader Garita*.<br1>
After that, go to the Warehouse and get us a case of Redstone Beer from *Warehouse Chief Reed*.<br1>
Finally, pick up a Miner's Pick from *Blacksmith Brunon*.<br1>
Brunon has become very absent-minded, so take these -- just in case you need to shock him back to reality!
