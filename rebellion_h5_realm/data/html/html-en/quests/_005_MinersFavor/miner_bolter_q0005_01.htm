Miner Bolter:<br>
I'm a member of the Gray Pillar Guild, which controls this Strip Mine.<br1>
Those hard-working Dwarves over there are all my guild brothers.<br1>
Frankly, we prefer it out here, living among the rock and rubble of the mine instead of some stuffy cottage back in the village.<br1>
The only drawback is that we still have to send someone into the village every few days to get supplies.<br1>
It was Fundal's turn to go, but he broke his leg in a mining accident this morning.<br1>
Do you know anyone trustworthy enough to go in his place?<br>
