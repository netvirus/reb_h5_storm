Warehouse Chief Reed:<br>
The item Bolter entrusted to me...? Ah!<br1>
You mean the Dion-brewed *Redstone Beer* he gave me last week! Where is it...here!<br1>
It goes down very smooth, I can tell you that.<br1>
Just the thing to wash away the dust of the road.<br1>
Just thinking about it makes me thirsty...<br1>
Well, well...uh, I really must return to my account book.<br1>
You'd best deliver it to Bolter before something...happens...to that cool, tasty beer...
