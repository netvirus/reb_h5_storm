<font color="FF8000">Miner Bolter:</font><br>
I'm a member of the Gray Pillar Guild, which controlsthis Strip Mine.<br1>
Those hard-working Dwarves over there are all my guildbrothers.<br1>
Frankly, we prefer it out here, living among the rock andrubble of the mine instead of some stuffy cottage back in the village.<br1>
The only drawback is that we still have to send someone into the villageevery few days to get supplies.<br1>
It was Fundal's turn to go, but he brokehis leg in a mining accident this morning.<br1>
