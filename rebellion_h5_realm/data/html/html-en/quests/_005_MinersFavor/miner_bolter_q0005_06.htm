Miner Bolter:<br>
You've done well, my young friend.<br1>
Thanks to you, we now have all the comforts of home!<br1>
Take this as a token of our gratitude.<br1>
It's nothing fancy, but you might find it useful one day.<br1>
In the meantime, what do you say to sharing a cold Redstone Beer with me?
