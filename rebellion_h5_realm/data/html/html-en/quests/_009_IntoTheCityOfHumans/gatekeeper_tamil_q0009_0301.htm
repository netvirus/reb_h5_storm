Gatekeeper Tamil:<br>
Giran is very far from here.<br1>
Here's a magic scroll that allows you to use the gate of time and space.<br1>
It's a scroll called the *Scroll of Escape to the Town of Giran*.<br1>
This is valuable, you can use it only *once*! Use it wisely.<br1>
I will put it in your quest item window.<br1>
I'll give you a *Traveler's Mark* as well.<br1>
When you wish to return to Immortal Plateau, hometown of the Orcs, take this mark and go visit *Trader Galladucci* at his boutique shop.<br1>
He'll help you. May the glory of Pa'agrio be with you!
