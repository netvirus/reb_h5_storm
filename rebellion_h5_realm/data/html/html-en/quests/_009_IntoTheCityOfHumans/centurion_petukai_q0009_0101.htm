I am devoted to the subject of power! Specifically,what is the most powerful thing in the world? Of course, dragons arequite formidable! But there is a beast who can subjugate even themightiest of dragons! They are called Humans.<br1>
We creatures of Paagrioare familiar with this scourge.<br1>
It was they who defeated us in battleand exiled us to this Immortal Plateau! But what is the source of theirvictory? Are they really more powerful than the mighty Orc? But I,Centurion Petukai, guard the great Flame Lord Kakai! I can't investigatethis myself.<br1>
