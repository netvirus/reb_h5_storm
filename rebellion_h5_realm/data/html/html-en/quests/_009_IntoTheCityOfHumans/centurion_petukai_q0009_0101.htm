Centurion Petukai:<br>
I am devoted to the subject of power! Specifically,<br1>
what is the most powerful thing in the world?<br1>
Of course, dragons are quite formidable!<br1>
But there is a beast who can subjugate even the mightiest of dragons!<br1>
They are called Humans. We creatures of Paagrio are familiar with this scourge...<br1>
It was they who defeated us in battle and exiled us to this Immortal Plateau!<br1>
But what is the source of their victory?<br1>
Are they really more powerful than the mighty Orc?<br1>
But I, Centurion Petukai, guard the great Flame Lord Kakai! I can't investigate this myself... Young Orc!<br1>
Find the answer for me!<br>
