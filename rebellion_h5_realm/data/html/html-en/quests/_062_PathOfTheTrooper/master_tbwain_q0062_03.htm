Ah, you have undoubtedly come here in order to become a Trooper.<br1>
It is true that as a Trooper, you will be able to learn more and higher-level skills.<br1>
But our guild only recognizes those whom we judge to be qualified and capable for this honor.<br1>
Put simply, to become a Trooper you must first take a test to prove yourself.<br1>
I don't think you are yet ready to take the test -- come back when you are more experienced.
