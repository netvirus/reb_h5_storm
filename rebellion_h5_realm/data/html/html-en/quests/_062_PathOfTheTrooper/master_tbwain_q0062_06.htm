Master Gwain Excellent! I like your boldness.<br1>
The test itself is verysimple.<br1>
You must defeat a certain malignant spirit to prove your braveryand strength and bring back the creature's heart as proof.<br1>
But no matter how talented you may be, a lack of experience will make you easy preyfor this spirit.<br1>
Therefore, before you begin the test, I advise you complete some additional training.<br1>
Frankly, I am sick of seeing the youngof our race die meaningless deaths after taking on this challengeequipped with nothing but courage.<br1>
So go to *Gludin Village*, train under *Master Shubain* and bring back his *letter of recommendation*.<br1>
Then we will discuss the details of the test.<br1>
