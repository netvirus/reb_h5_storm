Excellent! I like your boldness.<br1>
The test itself is very simple.<br1>
You must defeat a certain malignant spirit to prove your bravery and strength and bring back the creature's heart as proof.<br1>
But no matter how talented you may be, a lack of experience will make you easy prey for this spirit.<br1>
Therefore, before you begin the test, I advise you complete some additional training.<br1>
Frankly, I am sick of seeing the young of our race die meaningless deaths after taking on this challenge equipped with nothing but courage.<br1>
So go to *Gludin Village*, train under *Master Shubain* and bring back his *letter of recommendation*.<br1>
Then we will discuss the details of the test.<br1>
