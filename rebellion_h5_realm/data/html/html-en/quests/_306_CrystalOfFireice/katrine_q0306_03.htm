Although I work as a merchant now, my specialty usedto be collecting and dealing in jewels.<br1>
I would ask travelers like youto obtain rare jewels, and I would sell them at Giran or Aden.<br1>
A littlewhile ago, I found some entertaining information while looking throughsome ancient documents at the School of Wizardry.<br1>
The *Stones of Waterand Fire* that were once used by the ancient Elf magicians could befound some place on this island.<br1>
It was a long-abandoned place calledthe *Elven Ruins.<br1>
* Sound interesting to you? The Elven Ruins are muchtoo dangerous for someone like me, but I'm sure you can handle itwithout a problem.<br1>
If you bring back the jewels that I'm looking forfrom the ruins, I'll pay you generously.<br1>
