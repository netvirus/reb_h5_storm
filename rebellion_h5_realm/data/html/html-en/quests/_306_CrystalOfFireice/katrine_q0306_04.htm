Thank you so much for granting my request.<br1>
Now pleaselisten carefully to my account.<br1>
The *Elven Ruins* here on Talking Islandused to be a place where the Elves taught the Humans magic a long timeago.<br1>
They say that underground, there used to be a temple where theElves performed sacrificial rites to the spirit kings of fire and water.<br1>
When the Elves left the island, they broke the *elemental Stone of Fire*and *elemental stone of ice*, which were in the underground templebefore they left.<br1>
But as the stones were shattered, the magic that wasemitted from the shards summoned water spirit undines and flame spiritsalamanders.<br1>
Therefore, underneath the Elven Ruins there are still manysalamanders and undines that have *Flame Shards*, fragments of theelemental Stone of Fire, and *Ice Shards*, fragments of the elementalStone of Water, in their bodies.<br1>
What you must do is go to the ElvenRuins and bring the fragments of elemental stones that are inside thebodies of the *salamanders* and *undines*.<br1>
I will compensate youaccording to the number of jewels that you bring back.<br1>
