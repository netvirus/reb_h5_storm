I am working as a trader now, but actually myexpertise is collecting and trading jewels.<br1>
I find rare jewels by askingfavors of travelers like you and sell them at Giran or Aden.<br1>
Not longago, I heard that one can find precious jewels at the *Elven Ruins* ofTalking Island.<br1>
It is an elemental stone used by the Elven Mystics orsomething like that .<br1>
Now that I think about it, the Elven Ruins maybe too dangerous for you to go to.<br1>
I was going to ask you to find methat jewel, but .<br1>
If you come across an opportunity later on toexplore the Elven Ruins, please come to me.<br1>
Then I will tell you indetail how to find the jewel there.<br1>
