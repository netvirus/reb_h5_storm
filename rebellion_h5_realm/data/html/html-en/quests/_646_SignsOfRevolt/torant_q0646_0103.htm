The Ragna Orcs are gathering their power, being careful not to expose themselves. This is a good time to use guerrilla tactics. If you can, please bring back the *Cursed Dolls* thae ghe Ragna Orcs use to control their evil creatures. About *180 of them* should be enough. *Ragna Orcs have the most Cursed Dolls, but among the summoned evil creatures, the Dark Corpse, Guardian of the Ghost Town ane sarangka's Succubus also have them.* Please help us!<br>
