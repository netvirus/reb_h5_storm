The Ragna Orcs are gathering their power,being careful not to expose themselves.<br1>
This is a good time to useguerrilla tactics.<br1>
If you can, please bring back the *Cursed Dolls* thatthe Ragna Orcs use to control their evil creatures.<br1>
About *180 of them*should be enough.<br1>
*Ragna Orcs have the most Cursed Dolls, but among thesummoned evil creatures, the Dark Corpse, Guardian of the Ghost Town andVarangka's Succubus also have them.<br1>
