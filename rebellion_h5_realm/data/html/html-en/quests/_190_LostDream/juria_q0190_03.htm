Ah, I see.<br1>
Well, I am afraid I must disappoint you.<br1>
TheCruma are entirely extinct.<br1>
Do you know of the ancient war between theElves and Humans? No? At that time, the last Cruma became our greatestally.<br1>
Despite its massive size and strength, though, we were overwhelmedby sheer number of Human warriors and forced to retreat.<br1>
The Crumafought a valiant rear-guard action, giving us the time to escape to asafe haven.<br1>
In doing so, it was mortally wounded and fell in the placenow called the Sea of Spores.<br1>
That was the last of its kind, and none ofits brethren roam this world in these latter days.<br1>
