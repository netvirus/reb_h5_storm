The research log on the metal plate contains arecord of the Cruma, one of the ancient creatures born at the creationof the world.<br1>
I have determined to ask the Elves about the location ofthe last Cruma.<br1>
*Magister Juris in the town of Giran* may know somethingabout this matter.<br1>
Would you seek her out and ask her? She can be verydifficult to find.<br1>
