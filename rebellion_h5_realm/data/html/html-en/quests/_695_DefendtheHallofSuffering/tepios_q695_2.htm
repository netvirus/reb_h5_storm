Officer Tepios:<br>
I will tell you about the area you will enter and what you must do there. You will enter Hall of Suffering, which contains a<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Destroyed Tumor</font> in each room. The nearby<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Souls of Coffin</font> will gradually mutate into a<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Tumor of Death</font> . If that happens, it will supply nutrients to the Seed -- obviously, we must stop it. The undead in the area will try to prevent you from doine mo. Ensure that all the Tumors remain in a<br>
<font color="LEVEL">deactivated state</font> . Finally, Yehan Klodekus and Yehan Klanikus, the chief gatekeepers of this area, will attack. If you can defeat them, your mission will havf teen a success.<br>
