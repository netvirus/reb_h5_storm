I will tell you about the area you will enter and whatyou must do there.<br1>
You will enter Hall of Suffering, which contains a<font color="LEVEL">Destroyed Tumor</font>in each room.<br1>
The nearby<font color="LEVEL">Souls of Coffin</font>will gradually mutate into a<font color="LEVEL">Tumor of Death</font>.<br1>
If that happens, it will supply nutrients to the Seed -- obviously, wemust stop it.<br1>
The undead in the area will try to prevent you from doingso.<br1>
Ensure that all the Tumors remain in a<font color="LEVEL">deactivated state</font>.<br1>
<br>Finally, Yehan Klodekus and Yehan Klanikus, the chief gatekeepers ofthis area, will attack.<br1>
If you can defeat them, your mission will havebeen a success.<br1>
