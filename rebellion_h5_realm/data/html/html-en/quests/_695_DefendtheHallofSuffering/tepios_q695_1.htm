Office Tepios:<br>
After several attempts, each area was finally<br>
<font color="LEVEL">stabilized</font> once we occupied the<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Seed of Infinity</font> . But now the power of Ekimus is again growing, and the undead have again begun to awaken. Our scouts think they will soon attack the<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Hall of Suffering</font> . If this area falls, the whole Seed will again fall under Ekimus' influence. That must not be allowed to happen. We need volunteers to help<br>
<font color="LEVEL">defend the Hall of Suffering</font> . Will you join them?<br>
