Oh, thank you so much! My son hasreturned to me and started learning to fish! Please, accept this tokenof my gratitude.<br1>
I wish I could give you more.<br1>
I'm just a poorfisherman, and I don't catch as many fish as I used to.<br1>
I don't blamemy son for wanting to run away from home, but what can I do.<br1>
