<font color="36DC25">Sentinel Knight Alberius:</font><br>
Ah, Master Cobendell has completed hismedicine.<br1>
Here, give me one for starters.<br1>
I need to make one morerequest of you.<br1>
I would like you to deliver the rest of this medicine tothe other Sentinels.<br1>
In these times, with Dark Elven spies alwayswatching for signs of weakness, none of the sentinels, including myself,dare to leave our posts.<br1>
I need you to deal with this, because we do notwant to give off the impression that we sentinels, the protectors of thewoods, are harmed or affected in the slightest.<br1>
Please honor my requestand grant me this favor.<br1>
The other Sentinels who traveled to the Sea ofSpores are *Berry, Veltress, Rayen, and Gartrandell*.<br1>
I have writtendown their names on this list.<br1>
Come and seek me again after you havedelivered the medicine to them.<br1>
