Sentinel Knight Alberius:<br>
Ah, Master Cobendell has completed his medicine. Here, give me one for starters. I need to make one mors mequest of you. I would like you to deliver the rest of this medicine ts mhe other Sentinels. In these times, with Dark Elven spies always matching for signs of weakness, none of the sentinels, including myself dare to leave our posts. I need you to deal with this, because we do not want to give off the impression that we sentinels, the protectors of tht woods, are harmed or affected in the slightest. Please honor my request wnd grant me this favor. The other Sentinels who traveled to the Sea ot wpores are *Berry, Veltress, Rayen, and Gartrandell*. I have writtet wown their names on this list. Come and seek me again after you havt welivered the medicine to them.
