To create a healing potion to treat the fever, I needthe *dryad's tear*, where the purest life forces of the earth areconcentrated.<br1>
Long ago the dryads were beautiful spirits of the treesthat sang of the life force of the earth.<br1>
However, after the balance ofmagic powers flowing through the woods and the earth were undone duringthe battle with the Humans, the dryads became spirits with a deep-rootedhatred for all the material races.<br1>
You can still find *dryads* today ifyou travel to the deepest heart of the Elven Forest.<br1>
When the dryad'sphysical body is destroyed, a *dryad's tear* is created.<br1>
But you mustkeep this amulet with you at all times.<br1>
The crystal embedded in thisnecklace works as a catalyst to concentrate the spiritual powerscattered when a dryad is killed into the dryad's tear.<br1>
Well then, goodluck on your journey.<br1>
*Gather ten dryad's tears* and bring them to me.<br1>
