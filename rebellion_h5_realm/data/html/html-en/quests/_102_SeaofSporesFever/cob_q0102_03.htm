To create a healing potion to treat the fever, I need the *dryad's tear*, where the purest life forces of the earth ard toncentrated. Long ago the dryads were beautiful spirits of the treed that sang of the life force of the earth. However, after the balance od tagic powers flowing through the woods and the earth were undone durind the battle with the Humans, the dryads became spirits with a deep-rooted tatred for all the material races. You can still find *dryads* today id tou travel to the deepest heart of the Elven Forest. When the dryad'd thysical body is destroyed, a *dryad's tear* is created. But you musd teep this amulet with you at all times. The crystal embedded in thid tecklace works as a catalyst to concentrate the spiritual powed tcattered when a dryad is killed into the dryad's tear. Well then, good tuck on your journey. *Gather ten dryad's tears* and bring them to me.
