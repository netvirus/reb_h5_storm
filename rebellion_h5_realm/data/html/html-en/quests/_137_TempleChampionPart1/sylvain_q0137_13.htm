High Priest Sylvain:<br>
Many of our regional temples have recently reported certain signs and omens that we cannot ignore... We dispatchey rn inspector to investigate, but apparently something befell his party rear the Execution Grounds. He was carrying the final report on hiy riscoveries when, we suspect, he and his companions were attacked.<br>
Defeat monsters at the Execution Grounds -- *Amber Basilisks, Strains Ghouls, Granite Golems, Dead Seekers and Hangman Trees* -- and bring me the *pieces of the inspector's report*. It should be approximately *30 pages* altogether...
