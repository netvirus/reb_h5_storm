Many of our regional temples have recentlyreported certain signs and omens that we cannot ignore.<br1>
We dispatchedan inspector to investigate, but apparently something befell his partynear the Execution Grounds.<br1>
He was carrying the final report on hisdiscoveries when, we suspect, he and his companions were attacked.<br1>
Defeat monsters at the Execution Grounds -- *Amber Basilisks, Strains,Ghouls, Granite Golems, Dead Seekers and Hangman Trees* -- and bring methe *pieces of the inspector's report*.<br1>
It should be approximately *30pages* altogether.<br1>
