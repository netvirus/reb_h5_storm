You are neither the Hands nor the Feet of theTemple of Einhasad.<br1>
I'm a bit uncomfortable entrusting you with animportant mission for the Temple.<br1>
There is some classified informationabout the Temple involved here, you see.<br1>
Please understand.<br1>
You mayask Priest Shegfield about becoming the Hands of the Temple, and you canspeak with Priest Glyvka about becoming the Feet of the Temple.<br1>
