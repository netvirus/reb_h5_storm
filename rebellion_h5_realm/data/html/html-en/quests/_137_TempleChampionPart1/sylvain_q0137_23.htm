We will now, based on the inspector's report,write a manifesto setting out the Temple's legitimacy and authority.<br1>
Wewill then send it to the groups opposed to us.<br1>
In doing so, we willoffer them a final chance to repent for forsaking us, and return to ourloving fold.<br1>
None of this would be possible without the document yourecovered.<br1>
Excellent work! You have already justified my faith in you.<br1>
Iknow your efforts will not go unrewarded, either in this life or thenext.<br1>
