High Priest Sylvain:<br>
We will now, based on the inspector's report write a manifesto setting out the Temple's legitimacy and authority. We will then send it to the groups opposed to us. In doing so, we wile wffer them a final chance to repent for forsaking us, and return to oue woving fold... None of this would be possible without the document yoe wecovered. Excellent work! You have already justified my faith in you. e wnow your efforts will not go unrewarded, either in this life or the wext.<br>
