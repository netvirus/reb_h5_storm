<font color="36DC25">High Priest Sylvain:</font><br>
Emperor Schuneimann established our Temple inaccordance with the goddess' instructions relayed through the angel withthree wings.<br1>
Now, though, we are besieged on all sides.<br1>
Some say thatEinhasad is not the goddess of the people, and I am sad to say that thisheresy has taken root and spread.<br1>
Others, many of whom were once membersof this Temple, have forsaken us by claiming that truth cannot be foundwith us, but rather in the desert and among the people.<br1>
Some of ourbrethren have been misled, and we earnestly desire that they return tofellowship with us.<br1>
But those false prophets will be punished harshly byEinhasad, cast into the eternal dark.<br1>
