<font color="36DC25">!Lady of the Lake:</font><br>
Don't you know who I am? My mother lost everythingthat she loved, and her grief over the betrayal was overpowering.<br1>
I amthe child who holds hope and faith in the future.<br1>
Some call me theGoddess of Water, but that title really belongs to my sister.<br1>
My name isEva.<br1>
I will give my trust to a mortal over my own siblings, if theyrecite with conviction, and believe in that new future.<br1>
