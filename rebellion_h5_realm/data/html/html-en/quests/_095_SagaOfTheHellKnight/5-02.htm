<font color="36DC25">!Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension searpainfully into your brain.<br1>
A female laugh seems to float by in thewind.<br1>
You sense the location of the next Stone of Commune.<br1>
It isbeing held by* the Guardians of Forbidden Knowledge beside the Tablet ofVision in the northeastern Valley of the Saints.<br1>
