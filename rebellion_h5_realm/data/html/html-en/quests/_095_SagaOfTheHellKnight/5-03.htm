<font color="FF8000">Table of Vision:</font><br>
I can no longer commune with this Tablet.<br1>
It seemsthat there are no marks of Waldstein, so finding the next Stone ofCommune is the best option.<br1>
You sense that the next stone is being heldby the* Guardians of Forbidden Knowledge near the Tablet of Vision inthe northeast part of the Valley of Saints*.<br1>
