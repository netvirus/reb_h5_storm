Dark Knight Mordred:<br>
Will you find Waldstein for us? As I said,<br>
Waldstein's been seen near the Tablet of Vision recently. He's probably paying homage to it...* Join the pilgrims of the Tablet of Vision so yoy pan follow Waldstein. Find out what he's up to.* Speak with* Guary payard of Goddard Castle Town*. He'll tell you what you need to do next.<br>
You should take a copy of the guild bulletin with you!
