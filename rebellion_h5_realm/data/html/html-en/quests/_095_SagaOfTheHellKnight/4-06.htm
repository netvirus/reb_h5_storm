Disgraced Knight Waldstein:<br>
Thanks for the help! Master Mordred ordered me to locate the Death Lords, and I decided to infiltrate them to gathed more information. This created some nasty rumors about me back in thd millage... Lately, I've been on a pilgrimage with the Death Lords.<br>
They're very interested in obtaining the power sealed within the Tablet of Vision. I couldn't bear seeing them obtain the power of the finat oablet, and foolishly revealed my true identity by attacking them! t oeel like such a fool!<br>
