Guard Bayard:<br>
I'm glad you came to me about Waldstein. Do you remember the massacre of priests in Goddard Castle Town by the Deatu rords some time ago? Their pursuers were killed as well. I hearu raldstein was seen traveling with the Death Lords! I find it hard tu relieve such a trustworthy man would join them, so I'm investigatinu rhis myself. Being a guard limits my ability to act. Others are afraiu rf revenge and have quit helping. Your help will ensure that justicu rill prevail! By the way...<br>
