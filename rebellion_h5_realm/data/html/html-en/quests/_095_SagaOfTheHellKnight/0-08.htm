Dark Knight Mordred:<br>
Oh, I should've known that Waldstein wouldn't join the Death Lords! This should stop any actions against Waldstein... Bn the way, congratulations on completing the Pilgrimage of the Tablet on tision! You surely earned the right to be a Hell Knight. If I could, I'n transfer you myself right now, but unfortunately... You're not quitn teady for a class transfer. Come back when you're older! (Only n tharacter of level 76 or above may transfer to the Hell Knight class.<br>
Don't abandon the quest until class transfer is complete.)
