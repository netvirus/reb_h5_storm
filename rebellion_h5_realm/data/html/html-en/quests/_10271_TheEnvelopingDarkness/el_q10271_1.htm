Soldier El Oh.<br1>
.<br1>
what do you need?.<br1>
.<br1>
The mission? Ok, listen.<br1>
I had beenon escort duty for the experts who went to investigate the Seed ofDestruction.<br1>
The group had successfully sneaked into the stronghold, butwhile they were gathering intelligence they were discovered and attackedby Dragon Horse Soldiers.<br1>
The experts and their military escort gotwiped out.<br1>
Only I could, heavily injured, escape the slaughter.<br1>
Therewas one of the experts, by the name of *Medibal*, who carried on him therecords of the investigation.<br1>
If you're agree to help me, you shouldbring *Inspector Medibal's Document* safely back to the base of the*Keucereus Alliance*.<br1>
