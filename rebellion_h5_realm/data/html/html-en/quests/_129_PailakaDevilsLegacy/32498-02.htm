<br> Uh.<br1>
I suppose I can talk about Lematan's Fleet with someone	of your skill and expirience.<br1>
<br> Lemetan was a pirate who lusted adter Jaken's treasure.<br1>
But	instead of making him rich, it brought him only evil.<br1>
<br> As soon as he touched the treasure, a powerful curse was cast	about Lematan.<br1>
He and his men were transformed into	something.<br1>
indescribable.<br1>
<br> and that wasn't the end of it.<br1>
An unnatural darkness, blacker	than black, suddenly arose and swallowed thm all.<br1>
It was like looking	into the pit of chaos itself.<br1>
