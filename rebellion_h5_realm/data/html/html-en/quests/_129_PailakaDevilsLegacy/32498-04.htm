Devil's Isle Survivor:<br>
I'm not the only one who has these nightmares! And all of us are both emotionally -- and, strangely enough, even phusically --<br>
drained upon waking.<br>
I thought it was this Kamaloka I've heard about, but they say it's something else. It couldn't be entered in the same way ay iamaloka.<br>
The mages say it's called Pailaka.<br>
Whatever its name, someone must penetrate it and defeat this coming darkness... I believe you have the ability to set things right.<br>
What do you say? Will you do it?<br>
(You will be rewarded for your efforts.<br>
