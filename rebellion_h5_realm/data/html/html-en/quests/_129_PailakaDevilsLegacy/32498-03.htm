<br> Chaos.<br1>
That's right.<br1>
That's the best word I can use to	describe it.<br1>
<br> It was like something ripped a hole in reality itself.<br1>
Both	captain and crew were sucked in.<br1>
<br> I later heared that power is called Kamaloka or Pailaka or	somesuch.<br1>
They say that it will engulf the entire world.<br1>
<br> That's when my nightmares came.<br1>
Soon after closing my eyes,	I dream of strenge and horrible monsters who forture me until I wake	again.<br1>
Ah, but the real problem was something else.<br1>
Do you know what	it is?	<br>	<a action="bypass -h Quest _129_PailakaDevilsLegacy 32498-04.<br1>
