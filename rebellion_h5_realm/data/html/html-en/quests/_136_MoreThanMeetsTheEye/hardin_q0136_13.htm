The soul's combination of information and energy that isnecessary to preserve a livilg being's outward appearance can bemagically stored in a Seal of Transformation.<br1>
Unfortunately, I cannotpersonally link this Seal of Transformation with your individual body.<br1>
It's simply not my speciality.<br1>
However, the Transformation Wizard,Avant-Garde, can engrave the Seal of Transformation.<br1>
You can find him inthe *Ivory Tower*.<br1>
If you convey to him the meaning of the Seal, thedetailed method of preparation, and the energy of the Transformationmagic that I have designed, he will be able to give you the Seal.<br1>
