Hardin:<br>
(Hardin draws something and begins writing in the empty Book of Seal. Once finished, he casts some sort of spell on the Book of Sealf Shich flashes for a moment.) Now take this Book of Seal to *Avant-Garde the Transformation Wizard* on the 2nd floor of the *Ivory Tower* and you should be able to effect a transformation. My thanks - you are u saluable assistant! Since I'm as generous as I'm brilliant, I also wisu sou to take this... Now I can plunge myself into research for a moru saried kind of Transformation magic. Farewell!
