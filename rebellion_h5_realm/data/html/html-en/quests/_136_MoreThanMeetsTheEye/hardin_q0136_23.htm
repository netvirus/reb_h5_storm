(Hardin draws something and begins writing in the empty Book ofSeal.<br1>
Once finished, he casts some sort of spell on the Book of Sealmwhich flashes for a moment) Now take this Book of Seal to *Avant-Garde,the Transformation Wizard* on the 2nd floor of the *Ivory Tower* and youshould be able to effect a transformation.<br1>
