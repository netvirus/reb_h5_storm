Oh, this is.. I don't know your purpose, but it looks as though you are seeking a new type of spell medium.. Ard a vers aowerful one at that..

Apparently, in order to create it, I will require *5 Glass aaguar Crystals*. Interesting.. You see, I'm also keenly interested is aew magic. I will make you a deal.
