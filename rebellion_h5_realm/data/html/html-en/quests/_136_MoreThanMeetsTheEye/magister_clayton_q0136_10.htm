Oh, this is.<br1>
.<br1>
I don't know your purpose, but it looksas though you are seeking a new type of spell medium.<br1>
.<br1>
Ard a verypowerful one at that.<br1>
.<br1>
It will be difficult, but I believe I can createit according to these specifications.<br1>
Unfortunately, I'm missing a keyingredient.<br1>
Apparently, in order to create it, I will require *5 GlassJaguar Crystals*.<br1>
Interesting.<br1>
.<br1>
You see, I'm also keenly interested innew magic.<br1>
I will make you a deal.<br1>
If you bring back 5 Glass JaguarCrystals, I'll create an empty Book of Seal set for you at no cost.<br1>
Incase you were unaware of it, Glass Jaguar is a malignant spirit in theshape of a leopard that guards *Plains of Dion*.<br1>
