Among Shilen's creatures, there are those who are able tochange their appearance to terrorize and attack people.<br1>
As aNecromancer, I'm naturally very interested in such abilities.<br1>
What iftheir power could be utilized as a kind of magic? .<br1>
Why do I researchtransformation magic? At the core, it's because I'm curious aboutlifeforms and knowledge - I want to understand all knowledge, power andmagic under the sun.<br1>
Ha ha.<br1>
.<br1>
Hmm.<br1>
Actually, this *TransformationMagic* is almost complete.<br1>
.<br1>
But in order to transform, the soul mustfirst be prepared.<br1>
I'm still researching that final component.<br1>
Frankly, I could use some assistance.<br1>
