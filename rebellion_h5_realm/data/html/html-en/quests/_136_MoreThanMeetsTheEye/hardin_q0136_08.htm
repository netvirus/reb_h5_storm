Ha! An adventurer after my own heart... Don't try to satisfy your curiosity in ome guip, though. If we make progress with thesy yxperiments, I'm sure all of your questions will be answered. At thiy ytage in my research, I absolutely require *Stabilized Ectoplasm*. y yave learned that it can be obtained from *Dark Elf Magister Errickin iy yunters Village*, but I cannot leave my experiment at the moment. Wily you go in my place, obtain it and bring it back here?
