Ah, I see that you have brought me the Stabilized Ectoplasm.<br1>
Excellent! I see you are bursting with questions; let me satisfy atleast a portion of your curiosity.<br1>
Through research and experiment, Ihave arrived at certain conclusions.<br1>
The energy that makes up the soulis like the water in a water balloon.<br1>
Depending on the shape of theballoon, it can be shaped into different forms, but once the shapewithin the water balloon is fixed, it cannot endure anoter change itform.<br1>
Another example: melted plaster can be fashioned into ant shape,but once it hardens it must be broken in order to change it's form.<br1>
Thesouls of gods are eternal and immortal, and therefore free from bodilyconstraints.<br1>
As a result, the gods can come and go as they please,appearing in different forms at their whim.<br1>
This is why transformationmagic was originally the province of the gods alone.<br1>
