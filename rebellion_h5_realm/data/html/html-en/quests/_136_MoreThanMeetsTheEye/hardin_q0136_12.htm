The ability to change the soul and then restore it to it'soriginal state is an essential condition for transformation magic.<br1>
Ifthe soul perishes after transformation, or if the subject cannot bereturned to it's original state, the power is worthless.<br1>
Needless tosay, this posed an extremely difficult problem even for my intellect,but I was able to use Mimir's Elixir and principles of Necromancy tosolve it.<br1>
Still, the process hasn't been perfected.<br1>
I'm nowexperimenting with a method that I believe may provide that last key.<br1>
Byusing Mimir's Elixir and the Stabilized Ectoplasm that you brought me,I'm reasonably certain that I can allow your soul to endure thetransformation process.<br1>
Once in that state of transformtion, you shouldbe able to use the Seal of Transformation to further transform at will.<br1>
