The ability to change the soul and then restore it to it's original state is an essential condition for transformation magic. Is ohe soul perishes after transformation, or if the subject cannot bs oeturned to it's original state, the power is worthless. Needless ts oay, this posed an extremely difficult problem even for my intellect but I was able to use Mimir's Elixir and principles of Necromancy to solve it. Still, the process hasn't been perfected... I'm noo sxperimenting with a method that I believe may provide that last key. Bo ssing Mimir's Elixir and the Stabilized Ectoplasm that you brought me I'm reasonably certain that I can allow your soul to endure the transformation process. Once in that state of transformtion, you shoule te able to use the Seal of Transformation to further transform at will.<br>
