Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! You must be more capable than I thought,huh? Ha Ha Ha! Now then, should I try to remember the old times?Hmm.<br1>
Let me see.<br1>
The forbidden power was obtained by a strangehermit.<br1>
It was taken away and divided by the gods.<br1>
It is sealed up inseveral Tablets of Vision.<br1>
In order to release the power that is boundin each tablet, you must have an object called a Stone of Commune.<br1>
EachTablet of Vision has its own individual Stone of Commune that it cancommunicate with! Ah! Here it is.<br1>
The first Stone of Commune.<br1>
Takethis and use it to communicate with the first Tablet of Vision which islocated on the south side of the Tower of Insolence.<br1>
I told youeverything I know.<br1>
So now, leave me in peace and go on your way.<br1>
