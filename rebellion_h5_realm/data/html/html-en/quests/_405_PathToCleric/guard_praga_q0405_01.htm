Ah ... that book. But that book was quite interesting. And I bought it for money.<br1>
I can't give it to you for free. Well, how about this?<br1>
Recently, I was making rounds in *the Ruins of Agony* when I happened into a fight with the *ruin zombies*.<br1>
At that time, I lost a pendant that my mother left me before she died. Please find it for me.<br1>
Here, this is the chain of the necklace. See if the pendant fits it, and then return them to me, please.<br1>
Don't wrinkle your nose like that. A true believer like you will be protected by your strong faith.<br1>
If you need direction, you can reach the Ruins of Agony by journeying west of the village.<br>
