<font color="FFFF00">Priest Zigaunt:</font><br>
By any chance, have you heard the rumors that there is a heretical book that criticizes our religion?<br1>
The book is called *"Understanding of Miracles,"* and it was actually written by a person who used to be a priest.<br1>
That is why the church wants to take care of this problem quietly.<br1>
Can you retrieve the books that have been sold?<br1>
Please do it undercover. The beginning of the rumor about this book was the *town of Gludio*.<br1>
Begin your search there.<br>
