What? The church designated my book as a forbidden book? This is truly too much! Have you read my book?<br1>
I was disappointed with the profession of Priest, which only focused on formalities. I gave up the profession and wrote my understanding of miracles as objectively as possible, as they occur beyond the positions of Priest or Human Crusader. And now it is being treated like this! However...<br1>
I cannot stand alone against those who hold all the power of the church... Please take pity on me and do me one favor.<br1>
The church will burn all the books they have collected but I don't want the book I spent my heart and soul writing to disappear forever.<br1>
Please *give this last book to Gallint at Einhovant's School of Wizardry*. He taught me the importance of knowledge.<br1>
If he puts the book in safekeeping, it may not become known to the world, but it will be preserved forever. Please, I beg you.<br>
