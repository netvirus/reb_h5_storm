*Understanding of Miracles*?<br1>
Ah! You are speaking of the books I sold not long ago. Threatening books? I don't know ...<br1>
As for me, I don't really know the contents of the book ...<br1>
I just got a few to sell because they said that a lot of people wanted to read it ...<br>
The church is collecting the books? Well, if that is the case ...<br1>
I will give them to you, but I bought those books with money so the church will compensate me for them, right?<br1>
I bought five books in all, and I'll give you the three that were not sold. The other two books were bought by*Guard Praga and Priestess Vivyan in this village*.<br1>
Go and ask them about the books.<br>
