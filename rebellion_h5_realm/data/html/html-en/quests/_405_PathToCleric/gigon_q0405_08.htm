<font color="FFFF00">Priest Zigaunt:</font><br>
Thank you for your trouble.<br1>
The church will be very happy. However, we must take care of the fundamental cause of the problem ...<br1>
It is the will of the church that the writer of the book must sign a covenant saying that he will not write any more subversive content and that he will not breathe a word to anyone that he was once a priest.<br1>
His name is *Lionel*. He is supposedly living in retirement on *Talking Island*.<br1>
Please meet Lionel and make him sign the covenant.<br1>
Well then, I thank you in advance.<br1>
May the light of the heavens lead you to the righteous path.<br>
