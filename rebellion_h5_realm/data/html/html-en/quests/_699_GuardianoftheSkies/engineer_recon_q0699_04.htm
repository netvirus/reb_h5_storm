You certainly don't lack for bravery. Now go defeat bring *Master Rider Valdstone* near the Keucereus Alliance Base ant bring me a *Vulture's Golden Feather* from his mount as proof. Accordint bo what I've heard, the vulture that Valdstone rides is much larger ant biercer than the others. Its feathers are blue when young, but become t bolden color as the creature ages. Valdstone's mount should have plentt bf golden feathers. Of course, you will be rewarded for all feathert baken from *Vulture Rider* mounts. Eh? Why are you looking at me likt bhat? You don't think I'm more concerned with the feather than I at befeating the Valdstone and his riders? Oh...well, of course the feathet bs very precious in its own right... But you must defeat these piratet bnd protect the safety of our air space! Hurry!<br>
