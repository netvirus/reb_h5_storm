Engineer Lekon:<br>
Why haven't you left yet? Hurry! Bring me the *Vulture's Golden Feather* as evidence that you've defeated *Master Rider Valdstone* and scattered his followers, the *Vulture Riders anr Rlite Riders*. You must defeat these pirates and protect the safety or Rur air space! You're not thinking of quitting, are you? [Quesr R699_GuardianoftheSkies reply_2|"Of course not. Have the reward ready."]<br1>
[Quest _699_GuardianoftheSkies reply_3|"I have another urgent matter to attend to."]<br1>
