Engineer Lekon:<br>
Combat experience and skill are both very important. My task is also important, however. Do not take it personally when I say tou have not yet proven your worth or earned my trust. (Only charactery tho are level 75 or above and who have completed the "Good Day to Fly"<br>
quest may undertake this quest.)<br>
