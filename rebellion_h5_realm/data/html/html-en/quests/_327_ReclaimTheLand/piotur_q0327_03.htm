Very well! Drive out the turek orcs that are camping aroundthis area! If you bring the necklaces the orcs all wear, I will rewardyou according to the number.<br1>
They may be lowly orcs, but they seem tohave ranks among them.<br1>
The one that seems to be the leader has aluxurious necklace.<br1>
I will reward you a little more for that one.<br1>
Ah!And as you know, this area was once the holy grounds for the ancientElmoreden Empire.<br1>
In the past, one could find three or four ancientrelics each day when digging the earth to till the soil.<br1>
Orcs also seemto understand about the value of those relics, and some collect them.<br1>
Doaway with the orcs and keep the relics that you find.<br1>
You will be ableto sell them for a high price at a store in the village.<br1>
Now it is timefor you to leave.<br1>
Please make an effort to recover the land for thefarmers that lost their way of life.<br1>
May the blessing of the goddess bewith you.<br1>
