So the rumors are true .<br1>
That the mercenaries fightingthe Orcs on the northwest shores are secretly selling relics of theancient kingdom .<br1>
How could they sell such valuable historicalartifacts to businessmen .<br1>
! Objects that represent the lives of ourancestors .<br1>
They'll be degraded into mere decorations and displays .<br1>
This should not happen! Please .<br1>
If any relics of the ancient kingdomshould chance to fall into your hands .<br1>
Don't sell them at the shop,but bring them to me .<br1>
I can't pay you, but .<br1>
I will try to sharesome of my knowledge with you .<br1>
And I will make sure that the relicsthat are recovered will all be used as research material for theresearchers of the Ivory Tower.<br1>
