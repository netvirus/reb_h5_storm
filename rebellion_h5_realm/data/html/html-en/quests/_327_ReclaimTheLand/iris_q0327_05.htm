This is a piece of a broken mirror.<br1>
This is probably aportion of one of the bronze mirrors used by noblewomen of the Elmoredenage.<br1>
Truly this is a very valuable artifact, that holds images of thelives of the ancient ones.<br1>
Thank you very much.<br1>
The relics you havebrought me will all be used as research material by the historicalresearch society of the Ivory Tower.<br1>
Take pride in the fact that youhave played a part in revealing our forgotten past.<br1>
