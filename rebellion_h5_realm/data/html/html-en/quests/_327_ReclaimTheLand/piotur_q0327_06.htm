I am sad to see you go, but it seems that our fates whichbrought us together for a time now must separate.<br1>
However, only the godsknow the destiny of people.<br1>
I may request your help again someday.<br1>
Or aday may come when I will help you .<br1>
we never know.<br1>
May the goddess'blessing be upon your future days.<br1>
