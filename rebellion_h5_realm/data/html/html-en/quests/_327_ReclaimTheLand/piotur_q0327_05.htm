Young soldier, you have fought well.<br1>
By the contract, I willgive you a reward according to the number of turek orc necklaces youhave brought.<br1>
Thanks to your efforts, the farmers who lost their way ofliving are one day closer to recovering their land.<br1>
Ah! Also, do notdispose of the ancient relics that the orcs kept on them, but collectthem all.<br1>
You can sell them for quite a high price in the village.<br1>
Whydon't you think of it as a kind of bonus for the work you've done? Nowthat I think about it, there is supposed to be a specialist ofarcheology in Gludin .<br1>
That person will be able to tell you the valueof these objects in more detail.<br1>
