This brass piece? It is part of a crown! However .<br1>
it's not the crown of a ruler, but a portion of the crown worn bypriests during ceremonies.<br1>
Look at these delicate carvings .<br1>
Beautiful, aren't they? It doesn't look like this item was madethousands of years ago, does it? Thank you very much.<br1>
The relics youhave brought me will all be used as research material by the historicalresearch society of the Ivory Tower.<br1>
Take pride in the fact that youhave played a part in revealing our forgotten past.<br1>
