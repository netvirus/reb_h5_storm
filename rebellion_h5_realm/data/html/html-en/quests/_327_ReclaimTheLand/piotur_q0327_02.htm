When we were at war with Gracia, all the farmers of this regionsought refuge in the east at Castle Gludio.<br1>
However, when we returned tothis land after the war, the turek orcs were occupying the surroundingarea! The lord is at the height of pursuing reconstruction, but hisattention does not extend to remote farm villages like this one.<br1>
However, we cannot wait forever for the lord's help, can we? My brotherand I have decided to collect money and hire mercenaries.<br1>
We willrecover the blessed land that we inherited from our ancestors! Now thatI come to mention it, you look like quite an experienced mercenaryyourself.<br1>
What do you think? Will you lend us your strength to recoverthe farmland that the orcs took away from us? I will give you amplecompensation.<br1>
