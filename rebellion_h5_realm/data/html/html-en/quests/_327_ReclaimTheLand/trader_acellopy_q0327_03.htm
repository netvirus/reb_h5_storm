I see you have collected five clay jar pieces .<br1>
All,all right .<br1>
I think I can restore the jar with this .<br1>
Look at thepattern engraved on this piece .<br1>
It is in the style of the earlyempire age .<br1>
If I match the pieces where the pattern continues .<br1>
Ah!It is done! .<br1>
You can see the lines of the cracks, but .<br1>
One way oranother .<br1>
I have assembled the jar to its original state .<br1>
A relicof the empire that is over one thousand years old .<br1>
this is a veryprecious legacy of history .<br1>
