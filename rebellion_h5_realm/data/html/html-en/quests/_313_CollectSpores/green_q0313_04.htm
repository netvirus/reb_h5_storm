We are attempting to gather information on 2 fronts.<br1>
The renowned Spellsinger Adria Lumingshine is currently on the shores ofthe Sea of Spores, while Hierarch Asterios is attempting to neutralizethe poisons that have seeped into our forest.<br1>
I have been assisting theHierarch's research by collecting and refining the leaves, roots andspores of various plants.<br1>
However, he recently asked me to find aspecific kind of spore pollen that is carried here by the wind from theSea of Spores.<br1>
The pollen is so fine that the only way to collect it isto extract it from *Spore Fungus*.<br1>
I'm needed here to oversee theextraction process, which means I need a volunteer to go to the forestand collect *Spore Sacs* from *Spore Fungi*.<br1>
