Long ago, we Elves dwelled in a beautiful land east ofthe Elven Forest, beyond the mountains.<br1>
But it was scarred by powerfuldark magic used during the Human-Elven War.<br1>
Now it is a poisonousexpanse called the *Sea of Spores*.<br1>
Worse, that noxious area is slowlyexpanding, contaminating our forest and gradually eroding our magicaldefense field.<br1>
Unless we can stop it, I fear it is only a matter of timebefore our village is destroyed.<br1>
Perhaps when you are more experienced,my young friend, you will help us fight this menace.<br1>
