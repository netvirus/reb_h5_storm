<font color="FF8000">Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension are againseared painfully into your brain.<br1>
Now the words of Naverius make sense.<br1>
I know where the next Tablet of Vision is! It's* southeast of HuntersVillage*.<br1>
Someone near the tablet has the Stone of Commune.<br1>
It's hard tomake out, but he seems to be riding something, and something else isbearing down on him from behind! And then the vision fades.<br1>
