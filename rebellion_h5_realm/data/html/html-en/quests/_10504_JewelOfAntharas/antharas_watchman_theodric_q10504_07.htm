	Watcher of Antharas Theodri$1<br>
	<br> Amazing! I congratulate you on your accomplishment!<br>
	<br> The crystal is filled with the energy of the land dragon.<br>
	<br> You have brought back the land dragon's energy.<br>
	<br> Alas... this victory is short lived. Though Antharas has been<br>
	defeated and we may celebrate peace for now... the land dragon will<br>
	return some day.<br>
	<br> As always, I shall sit here and wait for that time to come.<br>
	And when it does I await your return to vanquish the land dragon again.<br>
	Please, take this... it should help you when the time comes again.<br>
