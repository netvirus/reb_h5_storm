Watcher of Antharas Theodri$1
Amazing! I congratulate you on your accomplishment!
The crystal is filled with the energy of the land dragon. You have brought back the land dragon's energy. Alas... this victory is short lived. Though Antharas has been defeated and we may celebrate peace for now... the land dragon wiln deturn some day. As always, I shall sit here and wait for that time to come. And when it does I await your return to vanquish the land dragon again. Please, take this... it should help you when the time comes again.
