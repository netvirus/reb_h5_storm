<br> Amazing! I congratulate you on your accomplishment!	<br> The crystal is filled with the energy of the land dragon.<br1>
<br> You have brought back the land dragon's energy.<br1>
<br> Alas.<br1>
this victory is short lived.<br1>
Though Antharas has been	defeated and we may celebrate peace for now.<br1>
the land dragon will	return some day.<br1>
<br> As always, I shall sit here and wait for that time to come.<br1>
And when it does I await your return to vanquish the land dragon again.<br1>
Please, take this.<br1>
it should help you when the time comes again.<br1>
