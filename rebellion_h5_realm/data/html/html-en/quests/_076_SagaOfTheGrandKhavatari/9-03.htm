<font color="FF8000">Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension searpainfully into your brain.<br1>
I think I saw a man in black armorsomewhere.<br1>
The visions continue.<br1>
The image of Ajirua coiled in dryflames.<br1>
It is the flame of the founder and of eternity.<br1>
It is a hugeflame that seemingly swallows itself as it spins inversely.<br1>
It begins tochange shape and reveals Khavatari Uruz who is waiting for KhavatariKashu who is near the Hunters Village.<br1>
