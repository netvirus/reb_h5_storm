If all you did was look from out here at the Plainsof the Lizardmen, you'd describe it as a beautiful magical place.<br1>
Ifonly that were true.<br1>
I was naive enough to believe that once, but thescars on my skin that I will leave here with will forever remind me ofthe truth.<br1>
Look at this.<br1>
and here.<br1>
you see? That's from the poisonsthat cover the Plains.<br1>
I'm just lucky to be alive.<br1>
How can I study underthese conditions? Further, how does a species survive amidst the cursedmagical energy that came from Antharas' blood that flows through theland? Not only survive.<br1>
they seem to to actually thrive on the magicand poisons.<br1>
That is the root of my research.<br1>
