As you know, there was war between Aden andGracia.<br1>
But the problem is, official trade with Gracia has since beenbanned, and Gracia trade ships no longer come to Talking Island.<br1>
Tsk, Ican't believe they would ban free trade for political reasons, it's asignificant loss to businessmen like me.<br1>
My business was quiteprofitable from my importing and selling of metals like adamantite.<br1>
plus, from a military standpoint, can't they realize that not being ableto produce fine quality adamantite weapons will lead to the weakening ofmilitary powers? Such a difficult situation.<br1>
Now this is our littlesecret, but actually, I am still trading with Gracia through *secretroutes.<br1>
* We may be political enemies, but that doesn't always make adifference in real life.<br1>
There is always a high demand for goods fromGracia.<br1>
So, what do you think? As long as you promise not to talk aboutthis in front of anyone else, I can tell you some more.<br1>
