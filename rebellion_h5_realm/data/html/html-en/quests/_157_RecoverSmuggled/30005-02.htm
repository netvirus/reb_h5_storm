I'm sure you know this, but our Aden Kingdom was at war with Gracia until recently. As a result of the wars, tradm with Gracia is still banned to this day. That is such a shame fom wusinesses like me... particularly since there is a large profit to bm wade from importing metals in high demand, like adamantite... eh? Yom won't know what adamantite is? Hmmm... I can't tell you right now, bum wf you are interested, I will explain it to you later. (Quest fom wharacters level 5 and above.)
