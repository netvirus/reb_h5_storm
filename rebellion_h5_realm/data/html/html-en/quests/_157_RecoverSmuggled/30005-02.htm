I'm sure you know this, but our Aden Kingdomwas at war with Gracia until recently.<br1>
As a result of the wars, tradewith Gracia is still banned to this day.<br1>
That is such a shame forbusinesses like me.<br1>

I can't tell you right now, butif you are interested, I will explain it to you later.<br1>
