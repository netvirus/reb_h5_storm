Good, then let me first tell you what*adamantite* is.<br1>
Adamantite is a very important metal for makingweapons.<br1>
Weapons and armor crafted from refined adamantite ore metal areof high quality.<br1>
Most other weapons can't even compare.<br1>
But thisadamantite is not found in Aden, and has to be imported from the Kardifregions of Gracia.<br1>
But since the trade ban was announced, it has beendifficult to find adamantite anywhere in the Aden Kingdom.<br1>
However,because I had established a partnership with a few Gracian traders longago, I have been able to bring adamantite ore into this island away fromthe eyes of the governor.<br1>
Well, strictly speaking, you can call itsmuggling.<br1>
Usually, we land the smuggling ship on the remote southernshores of Talking Island, then load the materials onto a small boat andtravel upstream to unload them on the shores of the lake nearEinhovant's School of Magic.<br1>
But an unforeseen accident a few days agohave put me in a bit of a dilemma.<br1>
So I'd like to seek your help withthat problem.<br1>
