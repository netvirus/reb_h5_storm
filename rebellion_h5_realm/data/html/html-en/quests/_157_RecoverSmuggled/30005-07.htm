Oh, you have recovered them.<br1>
Good job! I mustsend them off immediately today, on the next trade boat to Giran.<br1>
Thisis all thanks to you.<br1>
Here, the reward that I have promised.<br1>
I hope youwon't talk to anyone else about this.<br1>
It won't be good if this reachesthe ears of the guards.<br1>
I trust that you will take care of things evenif I stop right here.<br1>
