Good, so we see eye to eye.<br1>
Now listencarefully to what I tell you.<br1>
Do you remember the day that the recentstorms hit? That particular day was the day that my 'business partners'and I were to bring some goods in.<br1>
Thankfully, the smuggler's shiplanded safely on the southern shores of the island.<br1>
Because I had tounload before sunrise, I attempted to move the goods to the unloadingplace, even if it meant overexerting myself.<br1>
But while going upstreamwith the adamantite ore loaded on my lifeboat, the boat was upturned bythe waters of the river that was swollen from the storm, and the ore wasscattered all around the lake.<br1>
My business partners and I spent allnight walking around the lakeshore gathering the ore.<br1>
But after wegathered together all the ore that we had collected, we were missingquite a large amount.<br1>
As I found out later, *giant toads* that live nearthe lake had swallowed the ore.<br1>
So what I would like to ask you to do iswalk around the shores of the lake adjacent to Einhovant's School ofWizardry, hunt the toads, and recover the *adamantite ore* that theyhave swallowed.<br1>
I have to send the goods to Giran, and I must sendtwenty at a time.<br1>
When you have gathered *twenty* of them, bring them tome.<br1>
I will give you a generous reward for them.<br1>
Now, go if you areready.<br1>
