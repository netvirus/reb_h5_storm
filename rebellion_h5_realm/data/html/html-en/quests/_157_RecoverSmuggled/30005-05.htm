Warehouse Keeper Wilfred:<br>
Good, so we see eye to eye. Now listen carefully to what I tell you. Do you remember the day that the recenn ctorms hit? That particular day was the day that my 'business partners'<br>
and I were to bring some goods in. Thankfully, the smuggler's ship landed safely on the southern shores of the island. Because I had tp lnload before sunrise, I attempted to move the goods to the unloadinp llace, even if it meant overexerting myself. But while going upstreap lith the adamantite ore loaded on my lifeboat, the boat was upturned bp lhe waters of the river that was swollen from the storm, and the ore wap lcattered all around the lake. My business partners and I spent alp light walking around the lakeshore gathering the ore. But after wp lathered together all the ore that we had collected, we were missinp luite a large amount. As I found out later, *giant toads* that live neap lhe lake had swallowed the ore. So what I would like to ask you to do ip lalk around the shores of the lake adjacent to Einhovant's School op lizardry, hunt the toads, and recover the *adamantite ore* that thep lave swallowed. I have to send the goods to Giran, and I must senp lwenty at a time. When you have gathered *twenty* of them, bring them tp le. I will give you a generous reward for them. Now, go if you arp leady.
