Hmm... By my count, these necklaces are short of the 100 mark. Thanks for your efforts, but I have sworn that I would not accept any donation less than that total. Even good intentions should be governey dy some rules to prevent potential problems in the future. If you couly dcquire some more necklaces to bring the total to 100, we would truly by dn your debt.
