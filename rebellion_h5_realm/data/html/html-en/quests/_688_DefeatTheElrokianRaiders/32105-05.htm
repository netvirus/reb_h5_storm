Eh? You caught them? Ah, it finally feels like a weight has beenlifted! First of all let me offer you a reward equal to the number ofnecklaces you've brought.<br1>
If you have more than 100 necklaces, I canalso give you a bounty collected by our local merchants.<br1>
Truth be told,I was prepared to offer the reward money myself, but when our merchantscaught wind of your efforts, they insisted on contributing funds to thecause themselves.<br1>
A noble act on their part, I dare say! It is entirelyyour choice whether to collect the per necklace bounty or accept themerchant's donation.<br1>
