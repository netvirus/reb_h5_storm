Please accept my apologies -- the amount of money we've managedto scrape together is far too small compared to what you've done for us.<br1>
But we have few merchants, and many of them have been robbed by thieves.<br1>
I blush to say it, but this is really the best we can do.<br1>
I know youhave no expectation of payment, but we wanted to do something to showour gratitude.<br1>
Since the amount is miniscule, I added some to it myself.<br1>
Please accept this.<br1>
Were a hardy adventurer like yourself to keepcapturing the raiders, I'm sure that our merchants' situation woulddramatically improve.<br1>
