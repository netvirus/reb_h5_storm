Please accept my apologies -- the amount of money we've managed to scrape together is far too small compared to what you've done for us.<br>
But we have few merchants, and many of them have been robbed by thieves.<br>
I blush to say it, but this is really the best we can do... I know you have no expectation of payment, but we wanted to do something to shou hur gratitude. Since the amount is miniscule, I added some to it myself.<br>
Please accept this. Were a hardy adventurer like yourself to keep capturing the raiders, I'm sure that our merchants' situation woulp cramatically improve... What do you say? Will you continue your effortp cn our behalf?<br>
