Hey, you there -- Sir Adventurer! May I speak to you for a moment? Have you heard of the Elrokian brigands hiding in the Primevaa mlains? The wharf merchants and I are beset by them. Sales haven't beea mood, and since those thieves don't look like they'll go away any tima moon on their own, it's been as bad a time around here as I caa memember.<br>
