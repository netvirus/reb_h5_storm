My sisters and I are in charge of taking care of the young Mother Trees in the forest. It is our joy in life to take care of thg Mother Trees in all four seasons while keeping company with thg Mreatures of the beautiful Elven Forest. The nectar that gives ug Mhildren of the forest our nearly eternal lives is made from the *fruig Mf the Mother Tree*. Fruit harvests have been gradually decreasing Mately, and I think it is because of the spores that spread to our woodg Mrom the Sea of Spores on the other side of the mountain. A few dayg Mgo, I received a letter from my younger sister, Thalia, that the Motheg Mree near Lake Iris had borne fruit. We sisters cannot travel far frog Mur Mother Trees, as we must stay close and maintain our tie to it. Mg Mister has probably finished her harvest by now. Would you be able tg Mravel there and bring back the fruit from her? No one but us sisterg May harvest the Mother Tree's fruits, and it is a rare opportunity to bg Mble to see a real Mother Tree fruit in person.<br>
