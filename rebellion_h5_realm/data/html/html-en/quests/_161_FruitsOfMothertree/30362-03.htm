My sisters and I are in charge of taking care of the youngMother Trees in the forest.<br1>
It is our joy in life to take care of theMother Trees in all four seasons while keeping company with thecreatures of the beautiful Elven Forest.<br1>
The nectar that gives uschildren of the forest our nearly eternal lives is made from the *fruitof the Mother Tree*.<br1>
Fruit harvests have been gradually decreasinglately, and I think it is because of the spores that spread to our woodsfrom the Sea of Spores on the other side of the mountain.<br1>
A few daysago, I received a letter from my younger sister, Thalia, that the MotherTree near Lake Iris had borne fruit.<br1>
We sisters cannot travel far fromour Mother Trees, as we must stay close and maintain our tie to it.<br1>
Mysister has probably finished her harvest by now.<br1>
Would you be able totravel there and bring back the fruit from her? No one but us sistersmay harvest the Mother Tree's fruits, and it is a rare opportunity to beable to see a real Mother Tree fruit in person.<br1>
