My sisters and I are in charge of taking care of the young Mother Trees in the forest. This task lets us see the changes to thg Mother Trees and the Elven woods in all four seasons, and we find it g Melightful task. The nectar that gives we children of the forest oug Mearly eternal lives is made from the *fruit of the Mother Tree*. Fruig Marvests have been gradually decreasing lately, and I think it ig Mecause of the spores that spread to our woods from the Sea of Spores og Mhe other side of the mountain. At this rate, we may not be able to makg Mectar anymore. My sister Thalia is the protector of the Mother Treg Mear Lake Iris, and has said that the Mother Tree there may soon beag Mruit. Do you think you could go and get the fruit from her when it ig Meady? (Elf characters with Level 3 and higher may undertake thig Muest.)
