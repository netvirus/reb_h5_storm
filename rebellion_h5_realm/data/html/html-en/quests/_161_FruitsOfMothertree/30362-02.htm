My sisters and I are in charge of taking care of the youngMother Trees in the forest.<br1>
This task lets us see the changes to theMother Trees and the Elven woods in all four seasons, and we find it adelightful task.<br1>
The nectar that gives we children of the forest ournearly eternal lives is made from the *fruit of the Mother Tree*.<br1>
Fruitharvests have been gradually decreasing lately, and I think it isbecause of the spores that spread to our woods from the Sea of Spores onthe other side of the mountain.<br1>
At this rate, we may not be able to makenectar anymore.<br1>
My sister Thalia is the protector of the Mother Treenear Lake Iris, and has said that the Mother Tree there may soon bearfruit.<br1>
