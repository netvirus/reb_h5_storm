Buy food from the Feed Sellers.<br1>
Without food thebeasts turn feral.<br1>
If that happens you've wasted everyone's time.<br1>
So dous both a favor, have enough food ready.<br1>
The cubs you can raise are*Alpine Buffalo, Alpine Grendel, Alpine Kookaburra, and Alpine Cougar*.<br1>
So raise em' right.<br1>
And when you do.<br1>
