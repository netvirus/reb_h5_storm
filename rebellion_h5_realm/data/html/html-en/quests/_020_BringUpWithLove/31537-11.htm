Beast Herder Tunatun:<br>
You've guessed it, I want that Jewel of Innocence!<br1>
Beasts crave them, but only the person who raised the cub can retrieve the Jewel of Innocence.<br1>
Also, and I don't know why, but you only get one chance to acquire that jewel.<br1>
I've only seen it once, truly unforgettable to say the least...<br1>
Get this jewel for me and the reward will be great.<br1>
What do you say?<br>
