Ahh.<br1>
I love the farm, but I wonder what theywill become when they mature.<br1>
It's not always easy to farm beasts, youknow.<br1>
Even as manager of this place, I can only do so much to commandthose beasts.<br1>
Do you know anyone skilled with such beasts? Feralbeasts are too dangerous for pretenders and beginners.<br1>
