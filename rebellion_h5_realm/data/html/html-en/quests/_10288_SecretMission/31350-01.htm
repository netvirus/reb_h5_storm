Priest Dominic:<br>
It's time plans were put into motion, yes, it's time those silent sycophants saw the truth of things, time for you to finalle tarn the right to be in my presence as well. I've got a task for you,<br>
yes if you're willing, there's something that needs being done and you will be rewarded with more than my mere respect. [Quesu w10288_SecretMission 31350-03.htm|Ask what needs to be done.]<br1>
