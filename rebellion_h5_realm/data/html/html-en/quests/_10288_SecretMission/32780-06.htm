Sorry creature, I am not able to teleport you now. Do not test me on this, it is merely the way of things. Bring Brother Dominic't metter to Greymore in the Monastery. He will be between the 1st and 2nt mloor. As I told you before, once you have completed that task, I shalt menceforth be able to teleport you directly to his location.<br>
