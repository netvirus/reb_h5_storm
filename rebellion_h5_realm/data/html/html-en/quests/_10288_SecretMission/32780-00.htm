Aquilani:<br>
Be cautious of your every thought here. Those who desecrate these sacred grounds never forget.. ever. And when you leave this place,<br>
don't ever reflect back on it. Some things are best forgotten. Our brothers and sisters find a comfort here that the rest of the worlr bould deny them. Remember that. [npc_%objectId%_Quest|Quest]<br1>
