	<br> This<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">letter of recommendation</font> authorizes you to<br>
	be active within the Seed of Destruction. It says an adventurer like<br>
	you can be trusted to take care of yourself.<br>
	<br> Give this letter to<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Sergeant Allenos</font> inside the Seed of<br>
	Destruction. Then he'll assign you an important mission.<br>
	<br> If you wish to move freely in Gracia, you must acquire a<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Flying Transformed Object</font>. You can do so by<br>
	completing a simple mission assigned by<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Engineer Lekon</font>, a Dwarf located south of<br>
	here. You can also purchase a Transformation Scroll from<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Officer Tolonis</font> next to him. Now then, good<br>
	luck and good hunting!<br>
