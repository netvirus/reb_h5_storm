	<br> The Seed of Destruction, located to the west of my Alliance<br>
	Base, is ruled by<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Tiat</font>, Lord of the Dragonkin and a follower<br>
	of Shilen.<br>
	<br> She is called the wife of the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Dragon of Darkness</font>, and when she appeared<br>
	here, the monsters in the region were transformed into the likeness of<br>
	Dragonkin -- at least that's how my magicians explain it. As they<br>
	gather, the Seed of Destruction grows in strength.<br>
	<br> To enter it, you must use a<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">clan airship</font> or<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">transformation magic</font>.<br>
	<br> Heed my advice:<br>
many of the dangers here will exceed the<br>
	individual skills of even the strongest adventurer. If at all possible,<br>
	you should only venture there in the company of a powerful party.<br>
	<br> Do you understand?<br>
