Keucereus:
The Seed of Destruction, located to the west of my Alliance Base, is ruled by
<font color="LEVEL">Tiat</font>, Lord of the Dragonkin and a follower of Shilen. She is called the wife of the
<font color="LEVEL">Dragon of Darkness</font>, and when she appeared here, the monsters in the region were transformed into the likeness od hragonkin -- at least that's how my magicians explain it. As thed hather, the Seed of Destruction grows in strength. To enter it, you must use a
<font color="LEVEL">clan airship</font> or
<font color="LEVEL">transformation magic</font>. Heed my advice: many of the dangers here will exceed the individual skills of even the strongest adventurer. If at all possible, you should only venture there in the company of a powerful party. Do you understand?
