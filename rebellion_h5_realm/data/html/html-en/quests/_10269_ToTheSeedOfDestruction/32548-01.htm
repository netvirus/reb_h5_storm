	<br> You look like you're ready for action. If so, I have a<br>
	mission for you.<br>
	<br> I'd like you to enter the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Seed of Destruction</font>. Since Dragonkin assumed<br>
	power there, it has become a extremely violent and dangerous place. A<br>
	skilled adventurer like you may do a great deal of good there.<br>
