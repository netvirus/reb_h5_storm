The seed of chaos planted in your very being is whatallows you to live according to your own will than being the clave offate.<br1>
That is freedom indeed.<br1>
Your will cannot be manipulated norcontrolled; it rebels against the old order.<br1>
Liberate it and you will befree of the shackles of fate.<br1>
Perhaps then you will be able to forge anew path.<br1>
