The goal of the journey.<br1>
As I told you before, Iwanted to know about our fate.<br1>
Our 3 great heroes, the Spicula of old,for all their skill are incapable of becoming anything other than whatthey are.<br1>
There can be no improvement, no change.<br1>
That is what we weremade to be, Kamael.<br1>
and that is the barrier that keeps us from ourtrue fate.<br1>
