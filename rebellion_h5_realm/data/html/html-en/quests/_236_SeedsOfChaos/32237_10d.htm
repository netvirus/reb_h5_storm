The Metusela Kamael were not created after the SpiculaKamael; both lines co-existed together.<br1>
Just as countless conditions hadto be perfect before I could exist, so countless conditions had to beperfect in order for you to be here today.<br1>
You Metusela Kamael wereinitially an extremely weak race, not unlike the Humans of the outerworld.<br1>
Sometimes I wonder if it would have been better had you remainedin your weakness.<br1>
But so long ago, no one could envision what wouldhappen.<br1>
