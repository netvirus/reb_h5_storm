Compared to the Kamael of that time, you are not weak.<br1>
Butcompared to other constructs of the Giants and servants of the gods,your race was childish.<br1>
You needed time to mature, to grow in strength.<br1>
Two strains of Kamael were created.<br1>
One was powerful beings, theSpikeulla Kamael, who could be the spear aimed at the skies.<br1>
The otherstrain consisted of Kamael like you.<br1>
These Metusela Kamael were createdweak, but time was on your side.<br1>
Metusela Kamael were also createdwith the help of the *wisest four* of that time.<br1>
Thanks to that, youhave better adaptation skills than we do.<br1>
