It may be possible to escape fate, but it is impossible toescape the rules of this world.<br1>
Although we were able to simulate theSeed of Chaos, unfortunately you cannot take the powers of the otherraces that were created by the gods.<br1>
Even so, you will be able to walkthe path of the other Kamael that you could not before.<br1>
