I will now break one of the restraints imposed upon you.<br1>
This power was bequeathed to myself and Mother Nornil by the ancients.<br1>
It will strengthen the *Seed of Chaos* within you.<br1>
Be warned, though --I do not know what side effects it may have on your body.<br1>
It is, afterall, the essence of chaos.<br1>
I do know that it will definitely help you tobreak through the limitations that you sense.<br1>
