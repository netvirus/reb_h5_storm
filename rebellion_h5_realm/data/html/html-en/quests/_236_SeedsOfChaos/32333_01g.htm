Ah.<br1>
If only time permitted, I would like to tell youeverything.<br1>
But it does not, unfortunately, and even now time isgrowing short.<br1>
Are you familiar with the word *"Spicula?"* Go ask one ofmy brethren, *Harkilgamed* about it and listen to his reply.<br1>
I canspeak no more -- I must disappear now.<br1>
Remember: *Spicula Kamael* Youwill find Harkilgamed hiding in the *Valley of Saints*.<br1>
