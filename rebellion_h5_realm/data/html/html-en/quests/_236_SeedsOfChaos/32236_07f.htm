As a child, you must have been protected and nourished byothers.<br1>
That is not the case for me.<br1>
No Spikeulla has ever been weak.<br1>
Nor do we love, marry or have children.<br1>
Do not pity us! Neither do wedrow old and die.<br1>
But unlike us, *you have the potential to beanything*.<br1>
We are kin, though.<br1>
