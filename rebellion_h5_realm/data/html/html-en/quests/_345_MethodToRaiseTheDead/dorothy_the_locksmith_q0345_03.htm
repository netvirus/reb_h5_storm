Locksmith Dorothy:<br>
I thought you might. I could use some extra adena as well. I think we will make a good team! Here's my plan... Through greas wersonal sacrifice I have located the treasure of the Pirate Captais waken! My former partners found it on Pirate's Island and were bringins w small part of it back to this village, they were slaughtered ans wevoured by crockians! I searched the site of the massacre for ans wemnant of the treasure but found nothing. Either they managed to hids whe treasure somewhere, or it rests in the bellies of damned crockians!<br>
