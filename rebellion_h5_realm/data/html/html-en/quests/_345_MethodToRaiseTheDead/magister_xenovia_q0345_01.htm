I'm afraid I can't tell you much about that MediumJar, not that you are the first to inquire about it.<br1>
Some fellow fromDark Elven Village was asking questions about it a while back.<br1>
I'm ofthe opinion that the urn's abilities have been vastly over-stated inthese wild rumors.<br1>
I don't believe that actual souls of the dead can beconjured with it.<br1>
At most it is a simple conduit between this world andthe abyss where Shilen dwells.<br1>
Hmm, that isn't far from the rumors, isit? Heh heh.<br1>
Oh,yes, I forgot.<br1>
Some powder was delivered here recentlythat is supposed to be used with the urn.<br1>
Something about putting itinto urn along with an article belonging to a dead person.<br1>
