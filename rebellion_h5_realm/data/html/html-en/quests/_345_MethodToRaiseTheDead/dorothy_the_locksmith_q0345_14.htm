Oh! Now I remember.<br1>
One time Iason Heine's nephew offereda reward for finding a young maiden.<br1>
His tastes are quite common foran aristocrat! If we play this right we could make alot of money! Youmustn't tell anyone about this.<br1>
Here, take this as compensation.<br1>
Thisinformation came from someone inside the Trade Guild.<br1>
If you take thisto the Blacksmith Guild, they will give you a good ammount of money forit.<br1>
