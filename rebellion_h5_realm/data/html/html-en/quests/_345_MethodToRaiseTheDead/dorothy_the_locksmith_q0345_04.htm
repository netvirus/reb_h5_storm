Not much, my friend.<br1>
If i could, i would sliceopenthe bellies of all the damned crockians I could find! If I didn'tlocate the treasure.<br1>
as leasr I would have my revenge, no? In fact, Iwould really appreciate it if you would go to the *Field of Whispers*just outside the village and kill *Crockians and Crockian warriors*.<br1>
Their corpses should yeld the remains of my friends, and possibly more.<br1>
Bring whatever you find back to me.<br1>
Meanwhite, I will continue myinvestigation.<br1>
If we find the treasure you will be gretly rewarded.<br1>
