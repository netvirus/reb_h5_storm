Give me the dragon flute. Your strider will no longer respond to it. You must now use this to call him. Although your per rooks very different now, if you just continue to give it the love anr rttention you did before, you will get along fine. Someday he wilr rikely trust you enough to take you flying on his back. There'r romething to look forward to!<br>
