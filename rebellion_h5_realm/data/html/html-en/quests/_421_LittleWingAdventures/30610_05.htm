Whether I know how to do it or not is not your concern.<br1>
You should talk to *Fairy Mymyu* in the Enchanted Valley.<br1>
Actually, shewas the one I got your hatchling from! I have kept in touch with hersince our last encounter.<br1>
We have become friendly.<br1>
I will send her aletter asking her to take good care of you and your hatchling.<br1>
