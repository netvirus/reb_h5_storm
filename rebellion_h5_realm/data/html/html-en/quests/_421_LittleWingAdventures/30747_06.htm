The four fairy trees are connected.<br1>
Their roots traverseunimaginable depths to touch the Mother Tree Glade in the Elven Forest.<br1>
The Essence of Wind, star, twilight and the abyss respectively flowwithin the trunks of these trees.<br1>
These elements are essential for ahatchling to mature properly.<br1>
Legend says that these trees wereplanted long ago by King Raul after he met the Lady of the Lake.<br1>
He didthis at the behest of the Lady of the Lake to stop the poisonous smogthat was coming over from Dragon Valley.<br1>
Now, in the northern section ofthe valley, *those damn hunters have settled down.<br1>
* And there is onething that you have to be absolutely careful about! While this sap isindispensible for a hatchling's growth, it is a deadly poison to yourrace.<br1>
*If you handle a fairy tree, you will likely get sick and die.<br1>
