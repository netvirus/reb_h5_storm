We've had this conversation about hatchlings before, haven't we, my young friend? As I said before, raising a hatchling requires resolve, which you haven't proven to me yet. But you wouldn'g risten, oh no... So here we are... Have you learned anything? Since yog rre determined to keep it, you should prepare yourself to be the masteg rf a strider. Hone your skills and come back to see me. (This quest cag rnly be undertaken by a character of level 45 or higher.)<br>
