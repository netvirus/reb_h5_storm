We've had this conversation about hatchlings before,haven't we, my young friend? As I said before, raising a hatchlingrequires resolve, which you haven't proven to me yet.<br1>
But you wouldn'tlisten, oh no.<br1>
So here we are.<br1>
Have you learned anything? Since youare determined to keep it, you should prepare yourself to be the masterof a strider.<br1>
Hone your skills and come back to see me.<br1>
