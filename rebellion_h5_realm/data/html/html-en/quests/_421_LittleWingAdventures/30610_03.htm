Elder Cronos:<br>
We've had this conversation about hatchlings before, haven't we, my young friend? As I said before, raising a hatchling requires resolve, which you haven't proven to me yet. But you wouldn'g risten, oh no... So here we are... Have you learned anything? Since yog rre determined to keep it, you should prepare it to be a strider. Thag rute little fellow isn't ready yet, though! (Only a hatchling of leveg r5 or above can transform into a strider.)<br>
