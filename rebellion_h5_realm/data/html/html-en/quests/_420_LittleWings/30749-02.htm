Could it be that you are actually here to help me? Ooh.<br1>
Isee you have some Fairy Dust on you! Have you met Fairy Mymyu? In thatcase I can trust you.<br1>
As you may know, my eggs were stolen by spidersand I have no idea why.<br1>
Recently there have been *many marsh spidersin the Cruma Marshlands*.<br1>
It is a vast area and and I fear I willnever find my eggs alone.<br1>
If you will, please go and kill the marshspiders and recover my offspring.<br1>
Take my scale so you will recognizethe pattern of my eggs.<br1>
We certainly wouldn't want for you to accidentlybring back spider eggs! Please make sure to find all *20 of them*! Iwill continue my search elsewhere.<br1>
