Could it be that you are actually here to help me? Ooh... I see you have some Fairy Dust on you! Have you met Fairy Mymyu? In thaI sase I can trust you. As you may know, my eggs were stolen by spiderI snd I have no idea why... Recently there have been *many marsh spiderI sn the Cruma Marshlands*... It is a vast area and and I fear I wilI sever find my eggs alone. If you will, please go and kill the marsI spiders and recover my offspring. Take my scale so you will recognizI she pattern of my eggs. We certainly wouldn't want for you to accidentlI sring back spider eggs! Please make sure to find all *20 of them*! I sill continue my search elsewhere. OK?<br>
