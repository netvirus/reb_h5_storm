Hmm.<br1>
A Deluxe Fairy Stone, eh? It shouldn't be very difficultto make.<br1>
Let's see what ingredients you have brought.<br1>
Coal,Charcoal.<br1>
gemstones.<br1>
silver and Toad Lord Back Skins.<br1>
It's allhere! If you will wait a moment.<br1>
I'll make it now.<br1>
Gemstone with base.<br1>
.<br1>
Polish with silver.<br1>
Umm, from this angle it seems very similar to aStone of Purity.<br1>
What is this, "Then reprocess with Stone of Purityagain.<br1>
"? Hmm, is that really necessary? Anyway.<br1>
