Let me guess.<br1>
You have come for a hatchling, am I right?You should reconsider this foolish choice! It will not fight and eatslike a pig.<br1>
You cannot ride it, but must escort it about like it is yourmaster.<br1>
Why do you want something that will give you such trouble andheartache? I suppose you want to raise it to be a wyvern.<br1>
If it werethat easy, I, Cronos, would be astride one instead of sitting heretalking to you! You should not expect more from a pet than to be cuteand cuddly.<br1>
I don't approve of your choice at all.<br1>
