Elder Cronos:<br>
Let me guess. You have come for a hatchling, am I right? You should reconsider this foolish choice! It will not fight and eats like a pig. You cannot ride it, but must escort it about like it is yous laster. Why do you want something that will give you such trouble ans leartache? I suppose you want to raise it to be a wyvern. If it wers lhat easy, I, Cronos, would be astride one instead of sitting hers lalking to you! You should not expect more from a pet than to be cuts lnd cuddly. I don't approve of your choice at all.
