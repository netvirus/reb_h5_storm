Nearby there are drakes and wyverns looking for their losteggs.<br1>
There is evil afoot.<br1>
Why would anyone steal eggs? Really.<br1>
! Iknow of at least five creatures who have had their eggs stolen.<br1>
Theclosest one to us.<br1>
is *Drake Exarion, who lives at the top of themountain to the west of Oren Castle*.<br1>
It is a very difficult place foryour tribe who cannot fly to reach.<br1>
*Drake Kalibran lives at the top ofanother mountain southwest of Oren Castle*.<br1>
Two-legged races like yourstypically have quite a bit of trouble climbing mountains, don't they?*Wyvern Suzet is searching in the northwest side of Death Pass*, alsoquite a mountainous region.<br1>
And south from there.<br1>
You will find*Wyvern Shamhai looking for her eggs in the low western mountains ofDeath Pass*.<br1>
And last, *Drake Zwov is in the reservoir of the westmountain ridge of Plains of the Lizardmen*.<br1>
You shouldn't have anyproblem reaching her.<br1>
Yes, I hope you can meet up with them.<br1>
All ofthem have lost their eggs and are quite frantic.<br1>
Take this poison ofmonkshood with you.<br1>
While deadly to your race it will quickly bring awyvern or drake to her senses.<br1>
If you stick it in the nose of one ofthese creatures, they will gladly do whatever you say.<br1>
