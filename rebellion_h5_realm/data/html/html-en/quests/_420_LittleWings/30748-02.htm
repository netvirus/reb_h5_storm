Gran Kain and Antharas, lord of all scaled four-leggedcreatures of this land! What an extraordinary meeting! This child of therace of our tormentors agrees to go and recover my children.<br1>
Thankyou, two-legged creature! As you know, the *Leto Lizardman Warriors*have stolen my eggs.<br1>
Those creatures have been seen *near the fortressthat you call Oren Castle*.<br1>
There are a *total of 20 eggs* that weretaken.<br1>
Kill the lizardmen and bring me my eggs.<br1>
Here is one of myscales.<br1>
The pattern on my eggs will match the pattern on the scale.<br1>
Thiswill allow you to differentiate my eggs from the eggs of their othervictims.<br1>
