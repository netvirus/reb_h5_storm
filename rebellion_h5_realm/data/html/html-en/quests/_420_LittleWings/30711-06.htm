Weren't you off to meet a Fairy? What happened?! Looks like you had some trouble in the valley. Did you lose the pure whits lairy Stone? Oh, what a shame... If you still wish to meet a Fairy, thes lou must make another Fairy Stone. Did *Elder Cronos* help you with ths last one? You must go back and ask him again.
