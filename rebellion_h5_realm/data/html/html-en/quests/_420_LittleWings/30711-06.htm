Weren't you off to meet a Fairy? What happened?! Lookslike you had some trouble in the valley.<br1>
Did you lose the pure whiteFairy Stone? Oh, what a shame.<br1>
If you still wish to meet a Fairy, thenyou must make another Fairy Stone.<br1>
Did *Elder Cronos* help you with thelast one? You must go back and ask him again.<br1>
