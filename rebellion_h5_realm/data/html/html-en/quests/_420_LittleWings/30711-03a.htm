Something happened to me when I was quite young.<br1>
I don'tremember it well, but.<br1>
If there are still Fairies living in EnchantedValley, they would most likely be found in *the deepest part of thenorthern valley*.<br1>
Take that Fairy Stone and.<br1>
Wait! Let me see thatstone again.<br1>
This is not an ordinary Fairy Stone! It's as white aspure driven snow.<br1>
This is the pure white Fairy Stone that Fairiescan't resist! You mustn't let any blood touch the stone.<br1>
In particular,the blood of creatures related to fairies.<br1>
If it gets blood on it itwill break immediately.<br1>
And there are many creatures there that don'tlike Humans at all.<br1>
Ah, yes, it is a very difficult situation.<br1>
*Youmust not attack any creatures in the Enchanted Valley* on your way tomeet the Fairy.<br1>
