One of my eggs? I see.<br1>
In other times, I would dragyou into the sky and drop you to your death.<br1>
But today I shall make anexception and listen to what you have to say.<br1>
All right.<br1>
I accept youroffer.<br1>
However, this is on the condition that you will find and bringback all *20 of my eggs*.<br1>
Understand? My eggs were stolen by the *deadseekers* who inhabit the place that Humans call the *Execution Ground*.<br1>
Take one of my scales.<br1>
Kill the dead seekers and find the 20 eggs thathave the same pattern as my scales and bring them to me.<br1>
