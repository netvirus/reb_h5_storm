My, my, hatchlings are very popular this season.<br1>
Iwill tell you what I can about them.<br1>
When they grow larger they arecalled striders and may be ridden.<br1>
Later they mature into flyingcreatures called wyverns.<br1>
Hatchlings are so cute and cuddly it's hard toimagine that they become such gigantic creatures! A hatchling will onlyobey one who possesses a certain degree of skill.<br1>
You're not yet up tothe task.<br1>
