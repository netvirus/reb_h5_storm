That jewel that I made for you earlier was so curious.<br1>
If itis too fragile it will be useless as an ornament.<br1>
It seemed rather weakand sensitive.<br1>
Do you suppose it was made for a special purpose? Oh,by the way, I have been asked to make something for Dwarves to use tocraft mithril and adamantite.<br1>
A jewel that is harder than a diamond.<br1>
