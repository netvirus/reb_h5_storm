Ah, so a Deluxe Fairy Stone will break when it comes incontact with blood? This stone is more fragile than I thought.<br1>
You knewabout this weakness before you fought? If Byron told you not to engagein combat, you should have followed his instructions.<br1>
How unfortunate!Oh well, some people never learn.<br1>
I'm just wasting my breath.<br1>
Aren't youready to give up and create a regular Fairy Stone? It's easier to makeand more durable.<br1>
