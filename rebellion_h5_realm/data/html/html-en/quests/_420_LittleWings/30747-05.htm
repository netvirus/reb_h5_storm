You haven't yet found the ones looking for their eggs? Whynot? Is it because the mountain was too high? Or perhaps, you forget thelocations that I told you? OK, I'll tell you again.<br1>
Please remember itwell! The closest one to us.<br1>
is *Drake Exarion, who lives at the topof the mountain to the west of Oren Castle*.<br1>
It is a very difficultplace for your tribe who cannot fly to reach.<br1>
*Drake Kalibran lives atthe top of another mountain southwest of Oren Castle*.<br1>
Two-legged raceslike yours typically have quite a bit of trouble climbing mountains,don't they? *Wyvern Suzet is searching in the northwest side of DeathPass*, also quite a mountainous region.<br1>
And south from there.<br1>
Youwill find *Wyvern Shamhai looking for her eggs in the low westernmountains of Death Pass*.<br1>
And last, *Drake Zwov is in the reservoir ofthe west mountain ridge of Plains of the Lizardmen*.<br1>
You shouldn't haveany problem reaching her.<br1>
