I am a cold-hearted beast.<br1>
Is this the Juice ofMonkshood? I suppose Fairy Mymyu told you that in order to straightenout a dull-witted wyvern, you would have to pour this poison into mymouth? Poppycock! You should throw away such dangerous stuff.<br1>
If youhave been sent by Mymyu, I suppose you are the one who will find my losteggs.<br1>
I guess you want a reward for your work, right? What is your wish?I will try to meet your expectations as much as possible.<br1>
