You are a mean, greedy and selfish creature! What harmwould it do to part with a little of the dust I gave you? Oh well, itseems to be moving normally.<br1>
If it's well fed and cared for it shouldthrive.<br1>
But the world is a very dangerous place, it can't be leftunprotected.<br1>
I shall hide the baby in the Elven world under my powers.<br1>
Take this flute.<br1>
You'll be able to summon the child at any time just byblowing on it.<br1>
Take heed.<br1>
