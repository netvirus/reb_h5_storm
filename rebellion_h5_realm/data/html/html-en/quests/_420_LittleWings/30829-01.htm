My, my! Hatchlings are very popular this season! I will tell you what I can about them. When they grow larger they arI walled striders and may be ridden. Later they mature into flyinI wreatures called wyverns. Take a look at this Katz. It's so cute anI wuddly it's hard to imagine that they become such huge creatures! HI wa... What is your interest in hatchlings? Would you like to raise one?<br>
