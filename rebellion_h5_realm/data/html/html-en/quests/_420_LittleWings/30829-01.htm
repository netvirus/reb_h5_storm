My, my! Hatchlings are very popular this season! Iwill tell you what I can about them.<br1>
When they grow larger they arecalled striders and may be ridden.<br1>
Later they mature into flyingcreatures called wyverns.<br1>
Take a look at this Katz.<br1>
It's so cute andcuddly it's hard to imagine that they become such huge creatures! HaHa.<br1>
