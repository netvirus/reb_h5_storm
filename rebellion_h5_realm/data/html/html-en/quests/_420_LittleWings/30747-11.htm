This is food for the hatchling.<br1>
This will help the childgrow strong.<br1>
Would the new mother care to do the honors? OK.<br1>
Themovement of the arms and legs seems to be quite healthy.<br1>
If it's wellfed and cared for it should grow up normally.<br1>

You'll be able tosummon the child at any time just by playing it.<br1>
Take heed.<br1>
