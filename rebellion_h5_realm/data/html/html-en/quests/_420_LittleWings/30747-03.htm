Ah, yes, I know why you have come.<br1>
You want a hatchling,don't you? Well, its not as easy as that.<br1>
To obtain a hatchling, youmust obtain the egg of a wyvern and hatch it.<br1>
The wyvern will notsurrender her egg without a fight.<br1>
Your race gives live birth, doesn'tit? Anyway, if someone were to ask you for your child, would you gladlygive it? No? Oh, really.<br1>
Well, your generosity must be rewarded, Ishall tell you a valuable secret.<br1>
It is not necessary for the egg tocome from a wyvern! Any egg from a scaled flying creature will do, suchas a drake or wyvern.<br1>
Their eggs will be easier to get since they havebeen acting odd lately.<br1>
Anyway, they can tell you more.<br1>
