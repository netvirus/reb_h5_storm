Are you still here? How fortunate! This gives me theopportunity to see my child again.<br1>
Oh yes! There is something I musttell you.<br1>
It is said that the lord of all creatures with scales andwings, who has been sleeping deeply in Dragon Valley has awoken.<br1>
Weakcreatures cannot even gaze upon his countenance.<br1>
I believe that soonmany races will unite and attempt to kill him.<br1>
I can guarantee that noneof them will ever succeed.<br1>
