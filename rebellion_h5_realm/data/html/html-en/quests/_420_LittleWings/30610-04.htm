<font color="36DC25">Elder Cronos:</font><br>
Are you deaf? You still insist on going there even thoughyou will surely be killed? Oh well, you were warned! Don't blame me ifyou wind up dead.<br1>
Now where is that book? You must listen carefully!Let's assume that by some miracle you survive the Enchanted Valley longenough to meet a fairy.<br1>
Do you really think this fairy will listen toyou and grant your request? Certainly not! The fairy will ignore you,not even bothering to laugh at your ignorance.<br1>
If you wish to catch afairy's eye you must have a *Fairy Stone*! You cannot buy one anywhere.<br1>
You must collect the ingredients and make it yourself! There are twotypes of Fairy Stone.<br1>
One is a regular Fairy Stone and the other is a*Deluxe Fairy Stone*.<br1>
The difference between them is quite mysterious,even for a wizened old sage like myself.<br1>
