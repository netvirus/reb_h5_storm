Oh well, what do I have to lose? Here is the list of ingredients you will need in order to create a *Fairy Stone*. Howovef ihis cannot be accomplished easily, not even by a skilled Dwarvef irtisan. I do know of a young lady named *Maria who lives in Dion Castlf iown* who can make a Crystal of Purity. I think she may also be able tf iake a *Fairy Stone*... If she can't help you I am afraid you may be ouf if luck. But you won't know until you ask, eh? By the way, among thf ingredients, the *Toad Lord's Back Skin* cannot be purchased. You musf io to the *Cruma Marshlands* yourself and kill a *Toad Lord* to collecf it.
