Oh well, what do I have to lose? Here is the list ofingredients you will need in order to create a *Fairy Stone*.<br1>
Howoverthis cannot be accomplished easily, not even by a skilled DwarvenArtisan.<br1>
I do know of a young lady named *Maria who lives in Dion CastleTown* who can make a Crystal of Purity.<br1>
I think she may also be able tomake a *Fairy Stone*.<br1>
