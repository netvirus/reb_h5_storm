Greetings, two-legged creature! What brings you up thistall mountain? If you intend to kill me with that weapon, pleaseproceed.<br1>
Those vicious *Leto Lizardman Warriors* have stolen my eggs.<br1>
Ihave already killed countless lizardmen trying to retrieve them but sofar my search has been in vain.<br1>
The depth of my grief precludes me fromkilling any more of those horrible creatures.<br1>
If you truly believe inthe sense of justice spoken of by your gods, please help me.<br1>
You mustfind the eggs holding my sleeping babies! If you retrieve all of theeggs that were stolen, I shall give you one of them.<br1>
This shoulddemonstrate my sincerity and profound sense of loss.<br1>
