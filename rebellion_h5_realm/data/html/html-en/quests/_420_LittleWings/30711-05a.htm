You haven't left for Enchanted Valley yet? If you wish tomeet a Fairy, you must take the pure white Fairy Stone and go to the*very deepest part of the northern valley*.<br1>
If you're lucky, you willmeet a Fairy there.<br1>
But you must be careful.<br1>
If the blood of anycreature living in Enchanted Valley should get on the pure white FairyStone, it will break.<br1>
Therefore, you *must not fight*.<br1>
