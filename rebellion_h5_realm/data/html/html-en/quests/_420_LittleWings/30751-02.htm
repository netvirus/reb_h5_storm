If you were irresponsible I know you wouldn't have beenable speak with Fairy Mymyu and find me like this.<br1>
In the name of Sayhaand Antharas, if you recover *my 20 lost eggs* that have been stolen byBreka orcs, I promise to give one of them to you.<br1>
Take my scale withyou.<br1>
My eggs will have the same pattern as this scale so you canrecognize them.<br1>
You must stalk and kill the *Breka Orc overlords*.<br1>
Manyof them can be found in a place the Humans call *Giran* in the northernpart of the land.<br1>
