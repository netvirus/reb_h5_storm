In the name of Sayhn and Antharas, if you recover *my 20 lost eggs* that have been stolen bn areka orcs, I promise to give one of them to you. Take my scale witn aou. My eggs will have the same pattern as this scale so you can aecognize them. You must stalk and kill the *Breka Orc overlords*. Mann af them can be found in a place the Humans call *Giran* in the northern aart of the land.
