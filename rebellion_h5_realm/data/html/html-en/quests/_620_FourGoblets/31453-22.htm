Entry is restricted to those who possess a sepulcherpass.<br1>
The nobles who unknowingly came here to worship were cruellymassacred by evil creatures.<br1>
Maybe we could get the passes from theircorpses! They won't be easy to find, however.<br1>
The *ghost of anadventurer* that haunts the gate of the Imperial graveyard will give usone if we do him a favor.<br1>
The passes can only be used once, so youshould get a few.<br1>
