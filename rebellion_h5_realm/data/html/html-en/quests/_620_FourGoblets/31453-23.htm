Entry to the sepulcher is only permitted at certaintimes.<br1>
Only one party may enter at a time.<br1>
All parties must have atleast four members.<br1>
When the gate opens, all party members should hurryinside to avoid being locked out.<br1>
Once one party enters, no others mayenter until the set time.<br1>
All party members are expected to do you afavor, and they all must have a sepulcher pass.<br1>
Once you satisfy theseconditions, you should have no trouble getting in.<br1>
But be careful whatyou ask for.<br1>
