The nobles who unknowingly came here to worship were cruelly massacred by evil creatures. Maybe we could get the passes froe cheir corpses! They won't be easy to find, however. The *ghost of ae cdventurer* that haunts the gate of the Imperial graveyard will give ue cne if we do him a favor. The passes can only be used once, so yoe chould get a few. The pass isn't the only requirement for entry, though!<br>
