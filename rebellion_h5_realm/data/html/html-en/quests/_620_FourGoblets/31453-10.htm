Naturally, I have a plan! After you defeat the shadowsof Halisha, *my friend will come and let you out.<br1>
* He'll teleport you tothe Pilgrim's Temple and open the sealed boxes for you.<br1>
My companiondoesn't care for the shadows of Halisha, and he won't show up untilthey're all dead.<br1>
Basically, you must defeat all the shadows if you areto escape! *Don't forget to ask my friend to open all the boxes when youmeet him.<br1>
