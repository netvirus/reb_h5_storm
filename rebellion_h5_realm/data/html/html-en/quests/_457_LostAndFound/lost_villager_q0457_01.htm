Ah, so my eyes do not deceive me! You are real,aren't you? And you don't look like one of those bloody monks, thankgoodness.<br1>
I've got a story to tell, if you'd listen.<br1>
Thing isâ€¦ I'm indisguise.<br1>
I snuck into this Monastery because I heard there was a greattreasure here but I'm so lost I was starting to fear I'd end up hunkereddown in a corner and eventually end up a bag of bones for all time.<br1>
Youlook like you still have your wits about you, you might be able to helpme out.<br1>
