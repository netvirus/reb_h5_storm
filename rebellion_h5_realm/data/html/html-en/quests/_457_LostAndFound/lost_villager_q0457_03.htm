Treasure Hunter Gumiel:<br>
Guh, OK, I know I've been in this room before, because I've seen that ugly painting and smelled that stinky monk. Seriously, that one monk stinks so bad, he's become a landmark in this place for a treasure hunter like me. They say to follow your nose, but s pever really took that saying seriously... (Only characters level 82 ans pbove can take this quest.)<br>
