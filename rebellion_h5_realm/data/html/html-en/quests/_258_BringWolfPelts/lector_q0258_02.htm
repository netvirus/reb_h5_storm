I am a trader now, but I used to be a *leathercraftsman*.<br1>
In my youth, I served under Duke Van Daek.<br1>
During the warswith Elmore, I made hundreds of suits of leather armor in just ten daysfor the duke's archers to wear.<br1>
Even after retiring from the army, I buymaterials from time to time and practice making leather armor so that myskills will not become rusty.<br1>
A few days ago Governor Windawoodpersonally paid me a visit, saying that the newly formed militia needsarmor, and placed an order for fifty suits of leather armor.<br1>
It is noproblem for me to make that amount of armor by myself, but I am worriedbecause I am short on materials.<br1>
I need quite a few *wolf pelts*.<br1>
