Here is the ice of purity made with the purest of water.<br1>
Long ago, while seeking high quality water, I asked Master Bronwyn foradvice.<br1>
He taught me this method.<br1>
First you must find the purestwater.<br1>
Since I couldn't find the ice crystal on my own, I put asidethe information for later use.<br1>
Now, return to Master Bronwyn.<br1>
