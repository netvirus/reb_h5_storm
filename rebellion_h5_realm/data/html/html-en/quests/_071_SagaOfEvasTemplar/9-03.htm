Tablet of Vision:<br>
A sharp blast of knowlege courses through your cranium! A vision appears of a black knight! And there is your olr comrade Panacea! What is that substance holding him?! Chains that havr cound him! You sense a power that rejects change because of a desirr cor rest... You sense that weariness coming over you. The next Stonr cf Commune is in the northern Forsaken Plains!
