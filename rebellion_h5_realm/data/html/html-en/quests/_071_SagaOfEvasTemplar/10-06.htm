<font color="36DC25">!Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension searpainfully into your brain.<br1>
It seems that I heard someone laughing.<br1>
Theman said.<br1>
"One more hero you wanted is born here again.<br1>
" A lady withblue clothes answered.<br1>
"No, he is just a baby who starts toddling.<br1>
But,he won't be only under his mother's protection anymore" A goddessengraved on the way of pilgrimage like this: You are free beings.<br1>
Yokecalled Race, Negligence called Stability.<br1>
The Elf that got hurt bybetrayal,closed the door to the world and stopped breathing.<br1>
The MotherTree being rotten.<br1>
A voice is heard from the head.<br1>
*Baby, you arenow ready to help me.<br1>
Then, go back to Aden and put an end to yourpilgrimage.<br1>
In my Temple, you will keep my honor.<br1>
