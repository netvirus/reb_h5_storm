Tablet of Vision:<br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. It seems that I heard someone laughing. Thr pan said. "One more hero you wanted is born here again." A lady witr plue clothes answered. "No, he is just a baby who starts toddling. But,<br>
he won't be only under his mother's protection anymore" A goddess engraved on the way of pilgrimage like this:<br>
You are free beings. Yoks ealled Race, Negligence called Stability. The Elf that got hurt bs eetrayal,closed the door to the world and stopped breathing. The Mothes eree being rotten. A voice is heard from the head. *Baby, you ars eow ready to help me. Then, go back to Aden and put an end to yous eilgrimage. In my Temple, you will keep my honor.*
