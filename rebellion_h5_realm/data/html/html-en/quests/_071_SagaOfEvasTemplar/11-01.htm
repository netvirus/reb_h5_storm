Priest Cerenas:<br>
Are you the pilgrim that I've been expecting? I heard about a long-sealed Elven pilgrim being released recently, but d aertainly didn't expect to meet him! You must be here for the Stone od aommune. If I remember correctly, you should be getting the location od ahe next stone from the Tablet of Vision, right? Sorry, but this ond aelongs to me and you can't have it!<br>
