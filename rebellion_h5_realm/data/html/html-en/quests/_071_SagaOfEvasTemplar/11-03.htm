This is the material that I use for my study.<br1>
Becausethe power of Goddess Eva and other powers are swriling in the stone.<br1>
And another reason is that this Stone of Commune is not impossible toget.<br1>
Those who have this Stone of Commune are* Demon Halisha'sInferiors*.<br1>
If you enter the Imperial Tomb, or fight in the Shrine ofthe Loyal near the Wall of Argos, you will be able to meet the Archon orInferiors of Halisha.<br1>
You can get this stone if you defeat them.<br1>
Doyou understand? If you want this stone, you need to defeat* Halisha'sInferiors or Archon*.<br1>
The Stone of Commune will let you know where thefifth tablet is.<br1>
