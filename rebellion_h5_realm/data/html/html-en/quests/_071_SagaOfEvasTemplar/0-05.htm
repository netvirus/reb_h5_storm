<font color="36DC25">Master Sinden:</font><br>
The highest honor amongst Elves is to be a guardian ofthe Mother Tree.<br1>
However, we are destined to leave the Mother Treeeventually.<br1>
You sense this as well since you've been fighting so long.<br1>
Here many people gather and live preparing the future.<br1>
We are saddenednot to have your skills to protect the Mother Tree, but I feel you couldbetter serve us by going on a pilgrimage that has long been forbidden.<br1>
