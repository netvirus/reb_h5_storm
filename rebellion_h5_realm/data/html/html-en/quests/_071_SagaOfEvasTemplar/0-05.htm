Master Sinden:<br>
The highest honor amongst Elves is to be a guardian of the Mother Tree. However, we are destined to leave the Mother Tref tventually. You sense this as well since you've been fighting so long.<br>
Here many people gather and live preparing the future. We are saddened not to have your skills to protect the Mother Tree, but I feel you could netter serve us by going on a pilgrimage that has long been forbidden.<br>
Will you do it?<br>
