Well done! As promised, I will reward you based on thenumber and type of necklaces you have brought after killing the goblins.<br1>
Their spirits must be significantly deflated! What is this, a contract? This is the suspicious memos all combined! Let me see .<br1>
Hmm .<br1>
Yes .<br1>
As I thought .<br1>
*The goblins were hired by the Silver ScaleGuild.<br1>
* I can't believe Balanki would hatch such a bold plot .<br1>
Well, Imust do something! Going straight to the Guild Elder Council is not muchfun .<br1>
I think meeting Balanki and coming to a mutual agreement isbetter! I finally have his weak point .<br1>
He must pay a high price forhis actions! Thanks to you, I have obtained valuable information.<br1>
SinceI am a fair Dwarf, I will reward you additionally for your unexpectedachievement.<br1>
