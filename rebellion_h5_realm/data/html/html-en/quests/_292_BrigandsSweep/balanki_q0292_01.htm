I heard you work for the Golden Wheel Guild .<br1>
Is thistrue? Oh .<br1>
I see.<br1>
Young friend, let me give you a piece of advice.<br1>
Spiron is only taking advantage of you.<br1>
That mean old man is onlyinterested in generating profits for his guild! Even if you should gethurt or run into trouble while carrying out guild business, don't expectSpiron to help you.<br1>
He'll only argue that that wasn't in the contract.<br1>
