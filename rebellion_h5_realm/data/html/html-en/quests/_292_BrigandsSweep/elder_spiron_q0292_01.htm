Business is bad these days because of the *goblinbrigands*.<br1>
The goblins have become so bold that they attack freightwagons now! Just last week, a wagon belonging to our guild was attackedby the goblin brigands.<br1>
I am thinking of addressing this brigand issuenext month at the Guild Association Elder Council .<br1>
But I can't waitthat long .<br1>
I need to do something about this .<br1>
