Welcome back! So you have taken care of the insolentgoblins that interfered with our business! Now I'll finally get a goodnight's sleep! Of course, we need to work very hard to cover lastmonth's loss .<br1>
Whew .<br1>
Anyway, you have done well! As promised, Iwill reward you based on the number and type of necklaces you havebrought after killing the goblins.<br1>
Thanks to your efforts, the insolentbrigands have been taught a lesson, but I am still worried .<br1>
A freightwagon is departing for Shootguart tonight .<br1>
