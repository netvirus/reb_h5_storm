Aren't you Spiron's messenger? What business do you havewith me? Hmm? What is this contract? Oh no.<br1>
Those goblins .<br1>

This puts mein quite a difficult situation .<br1>
However .<br1>
Why did you bring thiscontract to me? Oh .<br1>
Now I understand .<br1>
If I give you the properprice, you will forget about this contract, right? You are as cunning asthat old man .<br1>
Ok.<br1>
Is this enough? Not enough? Now, this should beenough.<br1>
You are a greedy one .<br1>
Give me the contract now! I will throwthis into the brazier in the forge tonight .<br1>
