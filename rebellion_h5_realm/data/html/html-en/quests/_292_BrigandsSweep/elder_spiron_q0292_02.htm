Business is bad these days because of the *goblinbrigands*.<br1>
The goblins have become so bold that they attack freightwagons now! The our guild has been taking great losses lately, becauseonly our wagons are being attacked.<br1>
I am thinking of addressing thisbrigand issue next month at the Guild Association Elder Council .<br1>
ButI can't wait that long .<br1>
So, I need to ask you a favor .<br1>
Would youlike to work for me? If you work for our glorious Golden Wheel Guild,your friends and colleagues will respect you even more.<br1>
Oh, and ofcourse I will reward you based on your work.<br1>
