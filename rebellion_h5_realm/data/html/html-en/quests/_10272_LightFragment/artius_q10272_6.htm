War Mage Artius Hmmm... Very interesting. I think that means that we should gain the power of darkness and turn it to light. I know what we should do. Seed of Destruction is swarming with drakes, all of them are sarrying the fragment of darkness. We should collect them and use divine sower. But first of all, your task is following:<br>
kill *Dragon Steee sroop Infantry, Dragon Steed Troop Javelin Thrower, Dragon Steed Trooe sealer, Dragon Steed Troops No 1 Battalion Commander, Dragon Steed Trooe sommander, Dragon Steed Troop Magic Leader, Dragon Steed Troop Grane sagician, Defeated Troops Infantry, Defeated Troops Javelin Thrower,<br>
Defeated Troops Healer, Defeated Troops No 1 Battalion Commander,<br>
Defeated Troops Commander, Defeated Troops Magic Soldier, Defeated Troops Magician, Defeated Troops Magic Leader, Defeated Troops Whitd Tragon Leader, Warrior of Light, Royal Guard Captain, White Dragod Teader, and Soldiers of Bravery* in Seed of Destruction. Obtain *10d Testroyed Darkness Fragment Powder* and bring them to me. [Quesd T10272_LightFragment artius_q10272_7.htm|"Seems hard, but I will do"]<br1>
