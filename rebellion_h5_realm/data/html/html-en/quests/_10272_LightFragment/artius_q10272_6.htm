<font color="36DC25">War Mage Artius Hmmm. Very interesting. I think that means that weshould gain the power of darkness and turn it to light. I know what weshould do. Seed of Destruction is swarming with drakes, all of them arecarrying the fragment of darkness. We should collect them and use divinepower. But first of all, your task is following:</font><br>
kill *Dragon SteedTroop Infantry, Dragon Steed Troop Javelin Thrower, Dragon Steed TroopHealer, Dragon Steed Troops No 1 Battalion Commander, Dragon Steed TroopCommander, Dragon Steed Troop Magic Leader, Dragon Steed Troop GrandMagician, Defeated Troops Infantry, Defeated Troops Javelin Thrower,Defeated Troops Healer, Defeated Troops No 1 Battalion Commander,Defeated Troops Commander, Defeated Troops Magic Soldier, DefeatedTroops Magician, Defeated Troops Magic Leader, Defeated Troops WhiteDragon Leader, Warrior of Light, Royal Guard Captain, White DragonLeader, and Soldiers of Bravery* in Seed of Destruction.<br1>
Obtain *100Destroyed Darkness Fragment Powder* and bring them to me.<br1>
