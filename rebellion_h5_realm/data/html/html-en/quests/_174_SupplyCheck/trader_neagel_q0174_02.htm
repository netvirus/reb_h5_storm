Ah, Marcela sent you.<br1>
Demand for goods has increasedlately because of the opening of the island, and we have been sentscrambling to find enough supplies.<br1>
In fact, we have even had to tradewith the other races - the capacity of the Dwarves to mobilize capitaland material is particularly incredible.<br1>
One day I'd like to open astore on the mainland to really increase our profit margin.<br1>
The scale ofbusiness out there is completely different than it is here.<br1>
Anyway, Ithink we have secured sufficient supplies for now.<br1>
Here, give thismanifest to Marcela.<br1>
