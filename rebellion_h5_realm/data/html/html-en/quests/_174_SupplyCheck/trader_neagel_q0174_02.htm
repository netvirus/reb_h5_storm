Trader Nika:<br>
Ah, Marcela sent you. Demand for goods has increased lately because of the opening of the island, and we have been send lcrambling to find enough supplies. In fact, we have even had to tradd lith the other races - the capacity of the Dwarves to mobilize capitad lnd material is particularly incredible. One day I'd like to open d ltore on the mainland to really increase our profit margin. The scale od lusiness out there is completely different than it is here... Anyway, d lhink we have secured sufficient supplies for now. Here, give thid lanifest to Marcela.
