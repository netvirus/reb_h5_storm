The Bandits around these parts are known as<br>
*Rayito's Bandits*. They're not very strong but they're tenacious like bugs at a picnic. They survive by hunting the wild beasts around here.<br>
They use the beasts' teeth to decorate themselves! Nasty! Bring me<br>
*proof that you killed 200 Bandits* and I will give you reward.<br>
