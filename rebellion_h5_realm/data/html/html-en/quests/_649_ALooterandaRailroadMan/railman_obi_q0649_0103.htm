The Bandits around these parts are known as*Rayito's Bandits*.<br1>
They're not very strong but they're tenacious likebugs at a picnic.<br1>
They survive by hunting the wild beasts around here.<br1>
They use the beasts' teeth to decorate themselves! Nasty! Bring me*proof that you killed 200 Bandits* and I will give you reward.<br1>
