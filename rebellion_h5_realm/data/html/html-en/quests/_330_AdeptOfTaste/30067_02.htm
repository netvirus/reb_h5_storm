So you haven't been able to gather all the moss yet.<br1>
As I told you, you must hunt giant ants like the *gray ant* and *giantcrimson ant* to obtain swamp moss.<br1>
Bring me *twenty bundles of moss* andI will prepare them for cooking.<br1>
<br>Swamp moss is usually green, but if you want a truly luxurious dish, youmust invest the time and look for *brown moss*.<br1>
