Is this Jonas' cooking? I tasted his cooking lastmonth.<br1>
He definitely has talent, but still lacks in some areas.<br1>
Hiscooking is flawless, but his selection of ingredients is.<br1>
inappropriate, should I say? I wonder what this dish will be like.<br1>
Oh!It's a steak! Shall I have a taste ? It is monster eye meat! How didhe think to cook it into a steak? What a unique idea.<br1>
The taste is verygood.<br1>
It would have been better if the sauce were a little richer.<br1>
Thesalad goes well with the meat, but it is not that fresh.<br1>
There are a fewflaws, but overall, I am pleased.<br1>
A little improvement will make it amagnificent dish.<br1>
I will give you this letter with my review.<br1>
Pleasegive it to *Jonas*.<br1>
And tell him that I look forward to finer cuisine inthe future.<br1>
