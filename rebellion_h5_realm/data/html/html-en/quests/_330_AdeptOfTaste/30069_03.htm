You have found all thirty Monster Eye Carcasses!Thank you for your efforts.<br1>
Now I will begin to prepare the meat.<br1>
Themonster eye has many pores that emit poisons on its body.<br1>
Therefore itis very dangerous if you do not trim the meat properly.<br1>
If you cut offall the dangerous sections, you are not left with much meat.<br1>
That is whyyou need thirty carcasses to obtain meat for one person.<br1>
There! Allfinished.<br1>
I have packed it well, so take it to your chef friend just asI've packed it.<br1>
Monster eye meat steak.<br1>
I am truly curious as to itstaste.<br1>
Tell your friend that I wish him luck.<br1>
