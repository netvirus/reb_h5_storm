I learned the arts of cooking from Master Croker, and havecontinued to develop my skills over the last ten years.<br1>
Though I do notknow how to wield a sword or cast spells, I am sure that I know moreabout cooking than anyone else.<br1>
But I am frustrated, as I have yet toreceive recognition for my talents.<br1>
I would like to prove my skills andbecome famous as the top chef of the kingdom.<br1>
And I want to return to myfamily with pride.<br1>
That is why I have come to Dion.<br1>
Every month, chefsfrom all over the kingdom come together to compete in a contest.<br1>
Thejudge is the Elf *Magister Mirien*, also known as the *Food Critic* forher food-judging abilities and discerning palette.<br1>
Cooks that receiveacknowledgement from Mirien receive a reward from the lord himself.<br1>
Ientered a chicken dish at the last contest, but failed.<br1>
But that wasbecause the weather was bad and the meat was not good! It has nothing todo with my cooking methods! I plan to enter the contest being held nextmonth.<br1>
I failed the last contest, but I want to try again with thismonth's cooking contest.<br1>
I have thought of a marvelous dish, but I amworried about the ingredients.<br1>
A dish depends on fresh, qualityingredients, but the ingredients needed for this dish are all hard tofind.<br1>
Please help me gather these ingredients.<br1>
If I do well in thecontest and receive the lord's award, I will give you half of it.<br1>
