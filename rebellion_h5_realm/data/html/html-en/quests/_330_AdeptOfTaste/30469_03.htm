Thank you.<br1>
The dish I am planning to make uses monster eye meat,which is usually used by Mystics in their research.<br1>
I want to cook themonster eye meat as a steak, the way Gracian nobility like it.<br1>
For that,I will need five ingredients.<br1>
I need *Mandragora Essence* to make asauce for the steak.<br1>
You can get this from *Trader Sonia.<br1>
* The saladthat will accompany the steak will be made from *marsh moss,* one ofDion's delicacies.<br1>
This moss only grows in the Cruma Marshlands, and itsrefreshing taste is truly a treat.<br1>
They say that you can find the mossif you ask *Priestess Glyvka.<br1>
I plan to make the salad dressing withmustard and *honey.<br1>
* You can obtain the finest honey if you ask *GuardJacob* a favor.<br1>
I will also make a *potato dish* to accompany the steak.<br1>
They say that the potatoes grown in Dion are the best in the kingdom.<br1>
You can obtain them from *Grocer Pano in Floran Village.<br1>
* The main dish,the steak, will be made from *monster eye meat,* like I mentionedbefore.<br1>
It's best that you go to *Magister Rollant* to find the monstereye meat.<br1>
Please gather these five ingredients for me.<br1>
I have writtenthem down on this list, so don't forget.<br1>
A dish's flavor depends on howmuch care was given in gathering the ingredients.<br1>
Your job is indeed animportant one.<br1>
Thank you.<br1>
