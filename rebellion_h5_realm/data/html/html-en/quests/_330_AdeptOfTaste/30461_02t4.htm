Is this Jonas' cooking? I tasted his cooking lastmonth.<br1>
He definitely has talent, but still lacks in some areas.<br1>
Hiscooking is flawless, but his selection of ingredients is.<br1>
inappropriate, should I say? I wonder what this dish will be like.<br1>
Oh!It's a steak! Shall I have a taste ? It is monster eye meat! How didhe think to cook it into a steak? What a unique idea.<br1>
It is trulydelicious! The sauce is excellent.<br1>
Did he use Mandragora Essence? Thefresh salad goes well with the meat.<br1>
Magnificent! I will give you thisletter where I wrote my review.<br1>
Please give it to *Jonas*.<br1>
And tell himthat I look forward to finer cuisine in the future.<br1>
