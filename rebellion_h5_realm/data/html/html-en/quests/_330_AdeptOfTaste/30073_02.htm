To make the honey, I need enough nectar to fill twentybottles.<br1>
You can obtain the nectar by hunting giant bees like the*bloody bee* and the *stinger wasp.<br1>
* But the stinger wasps are verylarge and ferocious, so be careful.<br1>
If you are lucky, you may be able toobtain something called *Royal Jelly* from worker bees are yet a week.<br1>
If I add Royal Jelly to the nectar, I will be able to make a moreflavorful, Golden Honey.<br1>
But for that I need *10 bottles of RoyalJelly.<br1>
* It is such a rare ingredient that you may have trouble findingit.<br1>
