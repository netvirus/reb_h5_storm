You need Mandragora Essence? I do not know who you havecome on behalf of, but if you need Mandragora Essence of the finestquality, you have come to the right person.<br1>
I can prepare MandragoraEssence for you, but first you must bring me *forty Mandragora Roots*.<br1>
You can easily obtain Mandragora Roots that have a red tint.<br1>
However,rarely, there are also *white roots*.<br1>
If I prepare the essence with onlythe white roots, I can obtain a clear, transparent fluid that is richerand stronger in taste compared to the red.<br1>
If you bring forty WhiteMandragora Roots, I can make you clear Mandragora Essence.<br1>
Since you areignorant, I assume you do not know which part of the mandragora tocollect.<br1>
Take this illustrated book of botany to refer to when yougather the roots.<br1>
