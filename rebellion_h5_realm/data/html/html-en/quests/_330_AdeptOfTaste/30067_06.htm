Oh my! You've brought me twenty bundles of brownmoss.<br1>
I will prepare them immediately.<br1>
You won't be needing the rest, soI'll take them.<br1>
Jonas will be able to create a wonderful dish from thisbrown moss.<br1>
He's had so many failures in the past.<br1>
I hope he canfinally receive acknowledgement for his cooking skills.<br1>
Here, all done.<br1>
I've rinsed off all the dirt and cut off any inedible portions.<br1>
Here,smell it.<br1>
Such a lovely, fresh smell, isn't it? Please deliver this toJonas as soon as possible.<br1>
And tell him I'll be praying for his success.<br1>
