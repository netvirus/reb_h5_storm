Dionian Potatoes? Yes.<br1>
People say they are the bestpotatoes in the kingdom, raised in our own province.<br1>
They are not onlybig but also sweet.<br1>
However, recently *hobgoblin plunderers* areinterfering with our potato production.<br1>
The farmers are experiencingsevere damage.<br1>
Those hobgoblin rascals steal flock, tear up the fields,and take all our crop.<br1>
If this goes on, it will be difficult toproperly harvest any crop this year, let alone potatoes.<br1>
Since wares arenot coming in, it is harder for me to keep up my trade.<br1>
The villagechief seems to be hiring some soldiers to try to keep out the thieves.<br1>
But it is not as easy as people thought it would be.<br1>
It would be nice ifyou went out and got rid of the hobgoblins.<br1>
If you take care of thetask, I will give you some Dionian Potatoes that I have in stock.<br1>
I willkeep my promise, so don't worry.<br1>
Here, I have written a Contract, sokeep it safe with you.<br1>
Remember the conditions of the Contract.<br1>
If youkill the hobgoblins and bring back *thirty Hobgoblin Amulets* as proof,I will give you a sack of Dionian Potatoes.<br1>
