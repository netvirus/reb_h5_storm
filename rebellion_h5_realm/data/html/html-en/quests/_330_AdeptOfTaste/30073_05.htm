I understand.<br1>
I will make a honey from the ingredients youhave brought me.<br1>
It's a shame we don't have enough Royal Jelly.<br1>
But it'squite all right.<br1>
I can make plenty of good honey from this.<br1>
Here you go.<br1>
A honey so sweet that slumbering grizzly bears will awaken with a snap!Ha ha! Be careful not to break the bottle while carrying it.<br1>
