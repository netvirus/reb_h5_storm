I see you have brought all five ingredients that I asked youfor.<br1>
Thank you for your trouble.<br1>
However.<br1>
I am sorry, but theingredients are not very much to my liking.<br1>
You could have found betteringredients if you had spared a little more time.<br1>
But we must nottarry any further, so I will go right into the preparations.<br1>
First, toslice the monster eye meat into appropriate pieces and marinate it indrevian wine.<br1>
Next, we go into preparations for the steak sauce.<br1>
MixMandragora Essence and vinegar and add thinly sliced onions.<br1>
There! Itis complete.<br1>
I have finished the setting and packed it, so please hurryand take it to *Magister Mirien*.<br1>
