Honey? Hmmm? How did you know? Actually, my family hasbeen in the beekeeping business for many generations.<br1>
Though I've becomea guard, I still haven't forgotten the skills of making a good honey.<br1>
Tomake premium honey, you must collect *nectar* from the giant bees thatlive here in Dion.<br1>
Nectar is the honey water that the bees store intheir honey sacs after sucking it out from flowers with their tongues.<br1>
Bring twenty bottles of this, and I will make a honey from it.<br1>
To gatherthe nectar, you must hunt the giant bee called the *bloody bee*.<br1>
Youcould also collect nectar from the *stinger wasp* that lives in theswamps, but it is such a large and ferocious creature that you must bevery careful when taking it on.<br1>
And since you probably don't know thestructure of a bee's honey sac very well, refer to this insect diagramwhile hunting.<br1>
Oh, and if you are lucky, you may be able to obtainsomething called *Royal Jelly* from worker bees that are less than aweek old.<br1>
It is a white liquid with a sour smell, but it is a rareingredient with much nutrition and flavor.<br1>
If you can bring me *tenbottles of Royal Jelly* as well, I can make an even more flavorful andGolden Honey.<br1>
