I understand.<br1>
I will go ahead and prepare the twentybundles of green moss you have brought me It would be best if we couldprovide brown moss for Jonas.<br1>
But since we are short on time, we haveno other choice.<br1>
You won't be needing the rest, so I'll take them.<br1>
Here,all done.<br1>
I've rinsed off all the dirt and cut off any inedibleportions.<br1>
Please deliver this to Jonas.<br1>
And tell him I will be prayingfor his success.<br1>
