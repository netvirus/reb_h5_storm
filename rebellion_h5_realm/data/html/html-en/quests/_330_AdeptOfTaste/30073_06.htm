You've brought me twenty bottles of nectar.<br1>
And tenbottles of Royal Jelly to boot! I will be able to make a deliciousGolden Honey from this! Here you go.<br1>
A honey so sweet that slumberinggrizzly bears will awaken with a snap! Put some of this honey on freshlybaked bread and eat it with a nice glass of warm milk.<br1>
Ahh.<br1>
