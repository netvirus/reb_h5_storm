I see you have brought all five ingredients that I asked you.<br1>
Thank you for your trouble.<br1>
However.<br1>
I am sorry to say this, but someof the ingredients you brought could have been better.<br1>
You could havefound better ingredients if you had taken a little more time.<br1>
But wemust not tarry any further, so I will go right into the preparations.<br1>
First, to slice the monster eye meat into appropriate pieces andmarinate it in drevian wine.<br1>
Next, we go into preparations for thesteak sauce.<br1>

There! It is complete.<br1>
