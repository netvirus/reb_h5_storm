So you are the one helping Jonas.<br1>
He told me that heneeds Swamp Moss for his cooking.<br1>
Swamp Moss is very refreshing and manypeople enjoy eating it, but it is very hard to find.<br1>
It only grows incold and damp places deep in the Cruma Swamp.<br1>
But I know an easier wayof getting this Swamp Moss.<br1>
It may be a little dangerous, but you don'tneed to wander the swamp for many days to find the moss.<br1>
Giant ants likethe *Gray Ant* and *Giant Crimson Ant* collect the moss to line theirnests.<br1>
You will be able to easily obtain the moss by hunting these ants.<br1>
Take this insect diagram along with you for guidance.<br1>
It shows where themoss is stored when the ant collects and swallows it.<br1>
Bring me *20bundles of moss* and I will prepare them for cooking.<br1>
Swamp Moss isusually green, but very rarely one may come across brown moss.<br1>
This*brown moss* has a fuller flavor and is more nutritious, and fetches ahigh price on the market.<br1>
If you want a more luxurious dish, it would bebetter to invest some time and find brown moss.<br1>
