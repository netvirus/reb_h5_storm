I see you have brought all the ingredients that I asked you.<br1>
Thank you for your trouble.<br1>
Some ingredients could be better.<br1>
but thiswill make quite a satisfactory dish indeed.<br1>
I will proceed immediatelywith the preparations.<br1>
First, I cut the monster eye meat into smallpieces and marinate it in drevian wine.<br1>
Next, we go into preparationsfor the steak sauce.<br1>
Mandragora extract combined with vinegar, thenthinly sliced onions.<br1>
And so! It is complete.<br1>
I have finished thesetting and packed it, so hurry up and take it to *Magister Mirien*.<br1>
Andplease tell me how she evaluated my cooking after she tasted it.<br1>
