Is this Jonas' cooking? I tasted his cooking lastmonth.<br1>
He definitely has talent, but still lacks in some areas.<br1>
Hiscooking is flawless, but his selection of ingredients is.<br1>
inappropriate, should I say? I wonder what this dish will be like.<br1>
Oh!It's a steak! Shall I have a taste ? It is monster eye meat! How didhe think to cook it into a steak? What a unique idea.<br1>
However.<br1>
Themeat is tough and the sauce seems too mild.<br1>
The salad goes well with themeat, but lacks freshness.<br1>
Is it because of the dressing? It was a goodattempt, but has some weaknesses.<br1>
I will give you this letter with myreview.<br1>
Please give it to *Jonas*.<br1>
And tell him that I look forward tofiner cuisine in the future.<br1>
