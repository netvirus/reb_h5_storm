I see you have returned.<br1>
I have already heard.<br1>
It is not easy toreceive a favorable review from the Food Critic Mirien.<br1>
However, we mustnot be satisfied at this level.<br1>
Next time, please find me betteringredients so I can try again.<br1>
It seems that the lord has already beeninformed of the results.<br1>
I did not receive a high score, but the lordsent some prize money.<br1>
As promised, I will give a portion to you.<br1>
And asa gift, I will give you a memo with the secrets of my cooking.<br1>
I supposeyou have your own dreams as well? Be patient and persevere.<br1>
Then somedayyou will fulfill that dream.<br1>
