Was it made by Jonas? I tasted his cooking last month.<br1>
He definitely has talent, but still lacks in some areas.<br1>
His cooking isflawless, but his selection of ingredients is.<br1>
inappropriate, should Isay? I wonder what this dish will be like.<br1>
Oh! It's a steak! Shall Ihave a taste ? It is monster eye meat! How did he think to cook itinto a steak? It is a unique idea.<br1>
Ahh.<br1>
Delicious! Truly delicious!The tenderness of the meat and the sauce are first rate.<br1>
Did he useMandragora Essence? The fresh moss salad goes well with the meat.<br1>
Thehoney mustard dressing is also very good.<br1>
Excellent! This steak is byfar the finest I have tasted since I have come out into the Human world!With these skills, I believe he has a great chance to become a courtcook of the King's Castle of Aden.<br1>
I will give Jonas the highest marks.<br1>
Please give him this review.<br1>
And tell him that I anticipate more of hisfine cuisine in the future.<br1>
