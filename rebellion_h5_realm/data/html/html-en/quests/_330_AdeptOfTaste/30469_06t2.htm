I see you have returned.<br1>
I have already heard the news.<br1>
It isnot easy to receive a favorable review from the Food Critic Mirien.<br1>
However, it seems that she was not greatly pleased.<br1>
What a pity.<br1>
Nexttime, please find me better ingredients so I can try again.<br1>
It seemsthat the lord has already been informed of the results.<br1>
Although I didnot receive high points, the lord sent some prize money.<br1>
As promised, Iwill give a portion to you.<br1>
Thank you so much for your trouble.<br1>
I hopewe can work together again next time.<br1>
