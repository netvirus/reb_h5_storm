I learned the arts of cooking from Master Croker, and havedeveloped my skills by myself for the last ten years.<br1>
Though I do notknow how to wield a sword or anything about magic, I am sure that I knowmore about cooking than anyone else.<br1>
But I am frustrated, as I have yetto receive recognition for my talents.<br1>
I would like to prove my skillsand become famous as the top chef of the kingdom.<br1>
And I want to returnto my family with pride.<br1>
That is why I have come to Dion.<br1>
Every month,chefs from all over the kingdom come together to compete in a contest.<br1>
The judge is the Elven Magister Mirien, also known as the *Food Critic*for her food judging abilities and discerning palette.<br1>
Cooks thatreceive acknowledgement from Mirien receive a reward from the lordhimself.<br1>
I entered a chicken dish at the last contest, but failed.<br1>
Butthat is because the weather was bad and the meat was not good! It hadnothing to do with my cooking methods! I plan to enter the contest beingheld next month.<br1>
I am currently thinking up a new dish that I can enter.<br1>
I would appreciate it if you could help me with gathering theingredients later.<br1>
