What can I do for you? Ah, Luis sent you! What's thisabout? Oh I see! Those vile Langk lizardmen are causing problems in thesouth.<br1>
You've already dealt with them? Very impressive! The Langklizardmen's sorcery has long been a mystery to us.<br1>
Up to now we haven'tgiven them much thought, since our magic has been more than enough tokeep them in check.<br1>
This new sorcery of theirs is something else,however.<br1>
I must find out what they're up to.<br1>
I'm glad to see you! Well,let me take a look at that.<br1>
Hmm.<br1>
This is no ordinary object! Whatcould be the source of its mysterious power?.<br1>
Who would have such athing?.<br1>
I can't say where it came from, but it's obvious that itssorcery bestows the power of a formidable entity into the bodies ofWarriors.<br1>
and I detect the scent of a dragon! I fear the Land Dragonhas awakened from its slumber.<br1>
Well, we've obviously got to deal withthis thing.<br1>
Hopefully it's not too late.<br1>
But what ever shall we do?Its power is growing by the moment!.<br1>
I'll bet Magister Rohmer ofGludio Castle knows what we should do.<br1>
But I can't just dropeverything and run to him.<br1>
