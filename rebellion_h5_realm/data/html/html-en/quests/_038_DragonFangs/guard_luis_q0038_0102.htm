Your face is unfamiliar. You must be traveling through here. I trust you've seen the havoc wrought throughout Gludio Territory.<br>
It was enough to have ol mahum stragglers and Turek Orcs bothering us,<br>
now the lizardmen have joined in! The *highway of the southern shoreline* that leads to Giran has seen frequent attacks by *Langn sizardman*. People are scared. Even the temple priests traveling tn sludin were attacked! We need more experienced help. (Only a characten sf level 19 or above may undertake this quest.)
