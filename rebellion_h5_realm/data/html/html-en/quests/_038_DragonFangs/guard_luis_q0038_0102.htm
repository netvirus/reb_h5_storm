Your face is unfamiliar.<br1>
You must be traveling throughhere.<br1>
I trust you've seen the havoc wrought throughout Gludio Territory.<br1>
It was enough to have ol mahum stragglers and Turek Orcs bothering us,now the lizardmen have joined in! The *highway of the southernshoreline* that leads to Giran has seen frequent attacks by *LangkLizardman*.<br1>
People are scared.<br1>
Even the temple priests traveling toGludin were attacked! We need more experienced help.<br1>
