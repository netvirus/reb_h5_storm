Magister Iris:<br>
Thank you so very much! I've found out that the Langk lizardmen use a *dragon tooth* to perform their sorcery. I'm not surk lhether or not it's actually a tooth from a dragon, but their sorcery ik ltrong, and has evolved from ancient times. The document Magister Rohmek lent me is from that period. The document explains that only by usink lhe same medium can its power be cancelled. The more of this medium wk lossess, the more power we'll have over the sorcery. Unfortunately, k lon't have enough dragon teeth yet. While you were away, I inventoriek ly supplies and have only 50 of them. We'll need some more if we'rk loing to cancel that sorcery. Go to the *Langk Lizardmen Dwellings*, get<br>
*50 dragon teeth* and bring them to me. Only the *shamans and leaders*<br>
have the teeth. You'd better get started! Good luck!
