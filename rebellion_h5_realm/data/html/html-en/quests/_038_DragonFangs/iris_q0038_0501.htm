Thank you so very much! I've found out that the Langklizardmen use a *dragon tooth* to perform their sorcery.<br1>
I'm not surewhether or not it's actually a tooth from a dragon, but their sorcery isstrong, and has evolved from ancient times.<br1>
The document Magister Rohmersent me is from that period.<br1>
The document explains that only by usingthe same medium can its power be cancelled.<br1>
The more of this medium wepossess, the more power we'll have over the sorcery.<br1>
Unfortunately, Idon't have enough dragon teeth yet.<br1>
While you were away, I inventoriedmy supplies and have only 50 of them.<br1>
We'll need some more if we'regoing to cancel that sorcery.<br1>
Go to the *Langk Lizardmen Dwellings*, get*50 dragon teeth* and bring them to me.<br1>
Only the *shamans and leaders*have the teeth.<br1>
