Ah.<br1>
Actually, I am simply binding you to theoath on Shilen's behalf.<br1>
She and she alone can give you Gazkh.<br1>
Youundoubtedly know that Shilen suffered unspeakable tragedy after the sealof Sailren.<br1>
The poor goddess was abandoned by her parents and brothersand sisters, shunned and transformed into the goddess of death.<br1>
Theworld today has forgotten how wise and powerful Shilen was.<br1>
Were shestill the water goddess, the chaos rampant in the world would be farless than it is.<br1>
