Yes, it is true.<br1>
There will be great danger, butif you face Sailren while wielding Gazkh, you will weaken the creature'spower.<br1>
Then we stone statues may gather all our power and seal him againin his prison.<br1>
But to wield Gazkh, you must take the Warrior's Oath,which can be made only by an Elrokian who has undergone a difficult riteof passage.<br1>
The spirit of that warrior's grave gave you his ashes sothat you might satisfy the conditions of the oath by giving them to me.<br1>
In doing so, you will become one with the Elrokian warrior.<br1>
