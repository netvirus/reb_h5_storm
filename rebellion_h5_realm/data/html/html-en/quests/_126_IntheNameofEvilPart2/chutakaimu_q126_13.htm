O Shilen! Let this broken sentinel return to its master'sside! Travel to a place where the thick trees lean against a cliff andhold their hands together.<br1>
To a place where the Elrokian warriors of oldcast off their worn bodies and left on the journey from which no manreturns.<br1>
Were it within my power, I would already be with them! Oh, mysilver-armored master.<br1>
