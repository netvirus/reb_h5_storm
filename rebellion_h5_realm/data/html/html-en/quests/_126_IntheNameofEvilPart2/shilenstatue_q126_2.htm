Oh, is that right? I have sensed the energyemmitted by Sailren had become stronger these later days and wondered ifthis ancient evil was simply waiting for its chance to strike.<br1>
Sadly,the seal stones can no longer completely hold him.<br1>
I have prayed toShilen to show me a solution.<br1>
Now, with your arrival here, I think ourgracious mother has answered our prayers.<br1>
It may be possible now todefeat it.<br1>
