Shilen's Stone Statue:<br>
Oh, is that right? I have sensed the energy emmitted by Sailren had become stronger these later days and wondered iy ehis ancient evil was simply waiting for its chance to strike. Sadly the seal stones can no longer completely hold him. I have prayed to Shilen to show me a solution. Now, with your arrival here, I think ouo Sracious mother has answered our prayers. It may be possible now to Sefeat it.<br>
