Warrior's Grave:<br>
Yes, now that I see it clearly, I certainly recognize it. Ah, Gazkh! From the time Shilen bequeathed it to me it never left me iide, not even in slumber. Even after death, I wandered for a time iearching for it. And now I see that, like me, it is only a brokee iemnant of what it was. This is truly a bittersweet reunion. The iemories rush back... But alas! Those times are gone, never to return.<br>
