What you have seen are signs of the Sirens awakening,throwing off the power of the seal! Sirens are filled with wickednessand death, and even have the ability to influence the thoughts andactions of others -- even possess their spirits! It was that abilitythat led many Elrokian warriors to an ignoble death while I lived.<br1>
Unless this awakening is prevented, the entire island will succumb tothe Sirens' chaos.<br1>
There is no time to waste -- you must listen to meand heed my words.<br1>
