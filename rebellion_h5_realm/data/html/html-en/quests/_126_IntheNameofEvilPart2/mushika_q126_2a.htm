You are indeed filled with curiosity! Very well, then.<br1>
Listencarefully and I will read to you the part in which the password ishidden.<br1>
The contents of<font color=LEVEL>Traces of Living Beings from Ancient Times</font>is fairly well known to any scholar of mythology or history.<br1>
.<br1>
In thedays of old, when the circle of the gods was broken, countless raceswere spawned from that circle.<br1>
The greatest of them were the godsthemselves; the next greatest were the Giants.<br1>
And the gods gave theGiants authority to rule over the world.<br1>
All scholars know this story,but in these latter days men wonder what has become of all the creaturesbrought forth into the world at the breaking of the circle.<br1>
Althoughthey had subjugated all the races of the world, the Giants seemed uneasyin their rule.<br1>
Legend has it that they then created a mighty army ofOrcs.<br1>
But no one knows their purpose.<br1>
There must still have beensomething or some creatures they considered a threat.<br1>
But what kind ofcreatures could threaten Giants in the safety of their mountains? Moreimportantly, what became of these mysterious creatures? I read thisdocument over and over again, but I never thought the password washidden inside.<br1>
I didn't know that this book was really a secret documentwritten in ancient secret passwords -- like others, I read it only withscholarly interest.<br1>
But although this seems to be like any otherdocument, through proper decryption we can discover its hidden meaning.<br1>
Legend has it that our ancestors once shared their secret documents inthis way, but I've never seen such a thing before.<br1>
