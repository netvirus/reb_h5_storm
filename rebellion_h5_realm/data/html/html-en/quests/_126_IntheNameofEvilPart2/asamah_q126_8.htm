Amazing! I am bewildered by hearing all that you have endured.<br1>
Listening to your tale just now, I can't help but wonder if you are theone the prophecies speak of, the one destined to save our Elroki tribeand restore us to glory.<br1>
The Warrior's Oath you invoked is so ancientthat we have lost the specific wording.<br1>
It is clear to me that anancient Elrokian warrior's spirit is within you.<br1>
