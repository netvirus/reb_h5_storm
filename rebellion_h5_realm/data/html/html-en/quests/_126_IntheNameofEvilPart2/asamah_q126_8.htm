Asamah:<br>
Amazing! I am bewildered by hearing all that you have endured.<br>
Listening to your tale just now, I can't help but wonder if you are the one the prophecies speak of, the one destined to save our Elroki tribe ond restore us to glory. The Warrior's Oath you invoked is so anciene ohat we have lost the specific wording... It is clear to me that ae oncient Elrokian warrior's spirit is within you. I hear and see the oroof of this, but still cannot bring myself to believe it!<br>
