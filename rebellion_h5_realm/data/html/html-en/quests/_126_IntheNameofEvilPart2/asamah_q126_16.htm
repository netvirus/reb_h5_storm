Shilen commanded my Elkrokhian ancestors to rule over thedinosaurs, using powerful magic to control and restrain them.<br1>
It was thepeak of Shilen's glory, and the world owed her a debt it could neverrepay.<br1>
But the other gods envied Shilen, and sought a chance todiscredit her.<br1>
At last she was seduced by her father, Gran Kain.<br1>
Greatwith child, she was punished by her enraged mother, Einhasad.<br1>
Einhasadcast her from the continent, installing in her place as the goddess ofwater the weak and timid Eva.<br1>
The primitive creatures who called hermother were suddenly abandoned, forever disrupting the balance of thisisland.<br1>
As a result, we Elrokians were forced to migrate to thesePrimeval Plains to escape the mindless fury of the dinosaurs.<br1>
When Evabecame the goddess of water, it was the single most unfortunate thing tobefall our tribe up to that time.<br1>
Shilen's misfortune continued fromthat day onward, and eventually she became slanderously known as agoddess of evil or a goddess of death.<br1>
Some historians also begandescribing her as the avatar of evil.<br1>
But I have heard that other,less-biased historical documents depict Shilen as a victim of Eva'sinsatiable jealousy.<br1>
They say that not only did we lose our wise andstrong goddess, but that all the suffering and chaos in our world is areflection of Eva's spiteful heart.<br1>
