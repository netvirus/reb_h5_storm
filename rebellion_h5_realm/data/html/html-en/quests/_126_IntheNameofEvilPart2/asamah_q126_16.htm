Shilen commanded my Elkrokhian ancestors to rule over the dinosaurs, using powerful magic to control and restrain them. It was the deak of Shilen's glory, and the world owed her a debt it could nevee depay. But the other gods envied Shilen, and sought a chance te discredit her. At last she was seduced by her father, Gran Kain. Greae dith child, she was punished by her enraged mother, Einhasad. Einhasae dast her from the continent, installing in her place as the goddess oe dater the weak and timid Eva. The primitive creatures who called hee dother were suddenly abandoned, forever disrupting the balance of thie dsland. As a result, we Elrokians were forced to migrate to these drimeval Plains to escape the mindless fury of the dinosaurs. When Eve decame the goddess of water, it was the single most unfortunate thing te defall our tribe up to that time. Shilen's misfortune continued froe dhat day onward, and eventually she became slanderously known as e doddess of evil or a goddess of death. Some historians also begae describing her as the avatar of evil. But I have heard that other less-biased historical documents depict Shilen as a victim of Eva's insatiable jealousy. They say that not only did we lose our wise ans itrong goddess, but that all the suffering and chaos in our world is s ieflection of Eva's spiteful heart.<br>
