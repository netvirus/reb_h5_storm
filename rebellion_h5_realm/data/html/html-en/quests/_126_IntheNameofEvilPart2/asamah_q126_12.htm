Ah, so you have heard part of the tale, eh? I'm not surprisedthat you didn't hear more -- many consider it blasphemy, after all.<br1>
Besides, a creature that considers itself an avatar of Shilen would beloathe to reveal the goddess' error, especially to an outsider.<br1>
You mustunderstand that some other races now fear and despise Shilen as thegoddess of death.<br1>
