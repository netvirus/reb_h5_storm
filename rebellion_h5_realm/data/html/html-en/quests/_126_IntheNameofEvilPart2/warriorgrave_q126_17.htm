There is no time to give you all the details now --they can wait until the first step is finished.<br1>
First, you must retrievemy ashes from this grave.<br1>
A memorial ceremony will prepare my remains;sing the<font color="LEVEL">Warrior Song</font>that inspired countless Elrokian warriors as they prepared for battle inthe days of old.<br1>
Summoned by that old tune, my bones will rousethemselves from their long slumber and emerge.<br1>
