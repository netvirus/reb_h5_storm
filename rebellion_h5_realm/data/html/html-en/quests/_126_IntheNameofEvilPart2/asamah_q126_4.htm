Apparently our ancestors wielded a powerful ax called Gazkh.<br1>
More than just a weapon, it was a sacred relic granted to our tribe bythe goddess Shilen herself.<br1>
Gazkh's most important power was the abilityto keep the dinosaurs of the Lost Nest sealed within their prison.<br1>
Butsomehow the ax's head was shattered, dispersing that power and creatinga number of side effects.<br1>
