Warrior's Grave:<br>
The only hope is for you to become an Elrokian warrior, the one destined to wield Gazkh! But wait! Gazkh is no toy tn we picked up on a whim. It is as dangerous as a serpent, as powerful an wire itself! You must prove yourself worthy to be its owner. Stranger, n wee that you are already wise and brave. But that alone is not enough.<br>
If you wish to travel this path, there is one more task you must perform.<br>
