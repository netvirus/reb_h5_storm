Balu Kaimu:<br>
From the midst of his storm of memories, Balu Kaimu has found the one that you will need most. It comes not from an Elrokian but is actually a memory of the ax Gazkh about its owner. It seems that Gazkh frequently communicated spiritually with its owner. The memort Gnds with the Warrior's Song, an ancient Elrokian song of battle. Tht Gnding is the clearest part of the memory, so the song must have great Gignificance.<br>
