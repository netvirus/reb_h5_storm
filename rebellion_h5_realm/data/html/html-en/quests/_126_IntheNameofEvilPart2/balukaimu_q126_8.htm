<font color="FF8000">Balu Kaimu:</font><br>
From the midst of his storm of memories, Balu Kaimu hasfound the one that you will need most.<br1>
It comes not from an Elrokian,but is actually a memory of the ax Gazkh about its owner.<br1>
It seems thatGazkh frequently communicated spiritually with its owner.<br1>
The memoryends with the Warrior's Song, an ancient Elrokian song of battle.<br1>
Theending is the clearest part of the memory, so the song must have greatsignificance.<br1>
