	<br> Yes. The yourney to reveal the truth about Kamaloka and<br>
	Kaneus can now begin in earnest thanks to the tissue samples you<br>
	provided.<br>
	<br> But there are still many Kamalokas to be investigated in this<br>
	world. And it is vital that we gather information about every Kamaloka.<br>
	You have already become an important member of this study.<br>
	<br> Thank you for your work. Good luck!<br>
