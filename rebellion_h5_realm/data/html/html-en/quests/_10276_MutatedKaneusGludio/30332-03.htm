Excellent! Visit the Kamaloka we can enter from Gludio, kill the Kaneus there and extract their cellular tissues. You will face the
<font color="LEVEL">Tomlan Kamos</font> and
<font color="LEVEL">Ol Ariosh</font> Kaneus. When you have extracted all the cellular tissues of the Kaneus, take them to
<font color="LEVEL">Magister Rohmer</font> at the Temple of Einhasad. I know he and the other Sages will appreciate your efforts. Good hunting!
