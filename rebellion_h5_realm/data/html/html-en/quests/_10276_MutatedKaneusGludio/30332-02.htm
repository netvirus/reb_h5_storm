<br> The favor I ask is on behalf of	<font color="LEVEL">Magister Rohmer</font> of the Temple of Einhasad.<br1>
The Sages of Magic, a group of magisters of which Magister Rohmer is a	member, are researching the Kaneus: recently discovered monsters of	Kamaloka.<br1>
<br> They know that Kamaloka exists between this world and the	infernal regions; "normal" monsters in that region mutate into the	Kaneus.<br1>
<br> They do not know the cause of this mutation, however.<br1>
<br> To assist their research into this matter, they asked me to	obtain some	<font color="LEVEL">cellular tissues of the Kaneus.<br1>
</font> Will you	help me?	<br>	<font color="LEVEL">(You may only undertake this quest only if		you are eglible to enter Kamaloka, Hall of the Abyss, level 23)</font>	<br>	<a action="bypass -h Quest _10276_MutatedKaneusGludio 30332-03.<br1>
