Oh! You're going to work with us! Welcome aboard! I'll tell youwhat I just found out.<br1>
We lost touch with a large party of our Guildmembers who had been dispatched to investigate the recent activities ofthe Ice Queen.<br1>
We recently got lucky and found out where they mightbe.<br1>
It seems that the Ice Queen put a curse on them and turned theminto ice sculptures! I think we should find out if there are anyremnants of their investigation.<br1>
The ice sculptures can be found on the*plains north of the entrance of the Ice Queen's castle*.<br1>
