Thank you.<br1>
But I must tell you something in advance.<br1>
Pleasedon't feel insulted, I only say it out of concern for you.<br1>
It may be alittle dangerous for you to travel to the Gludio mainland.<br1>
It is a landmade barren during the war against the devil Beleth, and a dangerousplace, where all kinds of monsters threaten the lives of innocentpeople.<br1>
It may be even more dangerous now than a thousand years ago whenBeleth existed.<br1>
Of course, the lord of Gludio is conductingreconstruction projects, but the southern regions of Gludio are stillbarren plains.<br1>
I have waited for more than a thousand years now, and itmakes no difference to me to wait a few more years.<br1>
There is no need tohurry.<br1>
Whenever you are ready to leave for the Gludio mainland, come andseek me.<br1>
