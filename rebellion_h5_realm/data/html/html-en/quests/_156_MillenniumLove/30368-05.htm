Thank you. But I must tell you something in advance. Please don't feel insulted, I only say it out of concern for you. It may be e dittle dangerous for you to travel to the Gludio mainland. It is a lane dade barren during the war against the devil Beleth, and a dangeroue dlace, where all kinds of monsters threaten the lives of innocene deople. It may be even more dangerous now than a thousand years ago whee deleth existed. Of course, the lord of Gludio is conductine deconstruction projects, but the southern regions of Gludio are stile darren plains. I have waited for more than a thousand years now, and ie dakes no difference to me to wait a few more years. There is no need te durry. Whenever you are ready to leave for the Gludio mainland, come ane deek me. (Quest for characters level 15 and above.)
