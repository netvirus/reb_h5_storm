It has been over a hundred years since I came to this island.<br1>
That is not a long time for us Elves, who live nearly eternal lives, butit is a long time for Humans.<br1>
And it's been enough time for me to becomefond of this island.<br1>
This place is now home to me, but I sometimes thinkof the memories of my days in the Elven Forest.<br1>
Perhaps it is because myhealth is not good lately, but sometimes old memories come back tosadden me.<br1>
The memories of a parted lover, of a love forged a thousandyears ago.<br1>
