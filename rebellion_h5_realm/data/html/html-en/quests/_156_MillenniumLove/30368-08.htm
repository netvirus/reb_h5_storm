I see .<br1>
Theon .<br1>
has gone back already to the arms of Eva.<br1>
It's not that I did not think of such a thing .<br1>
but it is all right.<br1>
There is no need to comfort me.<br1>
I had hoped to see his face just once.<br1>
I just wanted to go near him and quietly call out his name .<br1>
Fateis such a cruel thing .<br1>
Making us meet and fall in love .<br1>
And tospend such a long time yearning for each other .<br1>
and finally separateus with death .<br1>
This .<br1>
This is Theon's diary? Thank you.<br1>
I wouldlike to be alone today and spend some time in quiet, reading this diary.<br1>
I will never forget your good intentions.<br1>
This is a small token of mygratitude.<br1>
Please accept.<br1>
