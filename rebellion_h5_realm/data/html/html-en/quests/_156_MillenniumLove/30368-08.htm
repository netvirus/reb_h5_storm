Lilith:<br>
I see ... Theon ... has gone back already to the arms of Eva.<br>
It's not that I did not think of such a thing ... but it is all right.<br>
There is no need to comfort me. I had hoped to see his face just once<br>
... I just wanted to go near him and quietly call out his name ... Fate is such a cruel thing ... Making us meet and fall in love ... And te ipend such a long time yearning for each other ... and finally separate is with death ... This ... This is Theon's diary? Thank you. I woule iike to be alone today and spend some time in quiet, reading this diary.<br>
I will never forget your good intentions. This is a small token of my gratitude. Please accept.
