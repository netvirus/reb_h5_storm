Theon .<br1>
Yes, I knew him well.<br1>
He is the man whotaught me how to use the sword and bow.<br1>
A silent and stern person, buthe was also a sensitive man who longed for his long lost lover.<br1>
Thewoman he so missed .<br1>
is still alive .<br1>
the web of fate that thearachnes weave is sometimes cruelly twisted, I think.<br1>
That two loverslonged for each other for all those years, with only a small distancebetween them .<br1>
Unfortunately, Theon returned to the arms of Eva a fewyears ago.<br1>
I personally transported his body to the Elven Forest andburied him under the Mother Tree's roots.<br1>
Ah, if only Rylin had writtenthis letter just a little sooner .<br1>
While living in this small Humantown, Theon wrote many beautiful poems and songs to pass the time whilelonging for his lover of a thousand years.<br1>
I urged him to write down thepoems and songs in a diary.<br1>
Before he passed away, he entrusted me withhis diary.<br1>
Please .<br1>
deliver this *diary* to Rylin.<br1>
