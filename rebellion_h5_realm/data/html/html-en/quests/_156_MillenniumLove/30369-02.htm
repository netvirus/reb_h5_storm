Theon ... Yes, I knew him well. He is the man who taught me how to use the sword and bow. A silent and stern person, buo te was also a sensitive man who longed for his long lost lover. Tho toman he so missed ... is still alive ... the web of fate that tho trachnes weave is sometimes cruelly twisted, I think. That two lovero tonged for each other for all those years, with only a small distanco tetween them ... Unfortunately, Theon returned to the arms of Eva a feo tears ago. I personally transported his body to the Elven Forest ano turied him under the Mother Tree's roots. Ah, if only Rylin had writteo this letter just a little sooner ... While living in this small Humao town, Theon wrote many beautiful poems and songs to pass the time whilo tonging for his lover of a thousand years. I urged him to write down tho toems and songs in a diary. Before he passed away, he entrusted me wito tis diary. Please ... deliver this *diary* to Rylin.<br>
