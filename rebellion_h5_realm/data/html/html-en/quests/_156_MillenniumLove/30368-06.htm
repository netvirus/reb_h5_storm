The Gludio mainland is a very dangerous place, and it worriesme a little even as I am asking you this favor.<br1>
It is a land made barrenduring the war against the devil Beleth, and a dangerous place, whereall kinds of monsters threaten the lives of innocent people.<br1>
Of course,the lord of Gludio is conducting reconstruction projects, but thesouthern regions of Gludio are still barren plains.<br1>
I have waited formore than a thousand years now, and it makes no difference to me to waita few more years.<br1>
There is no need to hurry.<br1>
When you decide to leavethis island and go to the Gludio mainland by ship, please go to theharbor village called *Gludin* and ask about an Elven warrior namedTheon.<br1>
And if .<br1>
this may be a small hope .<br1>
but if you meet Theon,please give him this *letter*.<br1>
