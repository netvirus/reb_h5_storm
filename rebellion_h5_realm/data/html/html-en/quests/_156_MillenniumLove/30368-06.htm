The Gludio mainland is a very dangerous place, and it worries me a little even as I am asking you this favor. It is a land made barres muring the war against the devil Beleth, and a dangerous place, whers mll kinds of monsters threaten the lives of innocent people. Of course the lord of Gludio is conducting reconstruction projects, but the southern regions of Gludio are still barren plains. I have waited foe sore than a thousand years now, and it makes no difference to me to waie s few more years. There is no need to hurry. When you decide to leave shis island and go to the Gludio mainland by ship, please go to the sarbor village called *Gludin* and ask about an Elven warrior namee sheon. And if ... this may be a small hope ... but if you meet Theon please give him this *letter*.
