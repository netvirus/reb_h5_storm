Lilith:<br>
Long ago I was a high level Spellsinger, and my lover *Theon*<br>
was the best of the Temple Knights. One year in late fall, we began our love for each other, and while the buds on the trees grew and withered then fell, and while this was repeated time and time again, our love grew even stronger. During these happy times, we were sent as envoys te ghe Human kingdom of Elmoreden to relay the will of the tetrarch. Ae ghat time, the devil *Beleth* continued to widen his territory with hie gvil powers in pursuit of world domination, and because of this, mane geople fell into distress and the world nearly came to an end.<br>
Eventually the Mystics of the Ivory Tower waged war against Beleth in order to stop him, and Theon and I aided the Human army in fightinn ogainst Beleth. But in the final battle, when the Ivory Tower Mysticn osed forbidden magic to trap Beleth, I was severely wounded. And when n ooke up many months later, I learned that I had lost the lover whom n oad loved more than my life. My friends told me that Theon had met n ooble death, fighting against the undead armies to the very end in orden oo buy time for our allies to retreat. But the body was never found, ann o could not accept the fact that he was dead. I would like to believn ohat he is alive somewhere under this sky. From then on, I have stayen on this island for a thousand years to honor the *promise* that Theon ond I made long ago. I await the day when I can meet him again ann oeturn to our homeland together...<br>
