<font color="FF8000">Lilith:</font><br>
Long ago I was a high level Spellsinger, and my lover *Theon*was the best of the Temple Knights.<br1>
One year in late fall, we began ourlove for each other, and while the buds on the trees grew and withered,then fell, and while this was repeated time and time again, our lovegrew even stronger.<br1>
During these happy times, we were sent as envoys tothe Human kingdom of Elmoreden to relay the will of the tetrarch.<br1>
Atthat time, the devil *Beleth* continued to widen his territory with hisevil powers in pursuit of world domination, and because of this, manypeople fell into distress and the world nearly came to an end.<br1>
Eventually the Mystics of the Ivory Tower waged war against Beleth inorder to stop him, and Theon and I aided the Human army in fightingagainst Beleth.<br1>
But in the final battle, when the Ivory Tower Mysticsused forbidden magic to trap Beleth, I was severely wounded.<br1>
And when Iwoke up many months later, I learned that I had lost the lover whom Ihad loved more than my life.<br1>
My friends told me that Theon had met anoble death, fighting against the undead armies to the very end in orderto buy time for our allies to retreat.<br1>
But the body was never found, andI could not accept the fact that he was dead.<br1>
I would like to believethat he is alive somewhere under this sky.<br1>
From then on, I have stayedon this island for a thousand years to honor the *promise* that Theonand I made long ago.<br1>
I await the day when I can meet him again andreturn to our homeland together.<br1>
