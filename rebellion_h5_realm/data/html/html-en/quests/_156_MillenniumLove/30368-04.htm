Before the beginning of the war against the devil Beleth, Theonand I made a promise to stay on Talking Island and teach the Humans theuse of magic for harmony and preservation, so that there would never beanother Beleth.<br1>
If Theon is still alive, I am sure he will come to thisisland to honor our promise.<br1>
It has been a thousand years since weparted, but I still hold on to the belief that someday he will come tothis island, and I continue to wait to this day.<br1>
Seasons change, andchange again, and as the years pass by, my heart is filled with despair,but I have not abandoned hope yet.<br1>
But a few days ago, I heard some gladnews while dining with Sir Windawood.<br1>
He says that he saw an Elvenwarrior in the village of *Gludin* fitting the description of Theon.<br1>
My heart was racing when I heard that.<br1>
