Have you been to the Cemetery? It's a dangerous place,where many monsters roam.<br1>
The neglect of the kingdom has allowed it tofall into ruins.<br1>
If we incur our ancestors' wrath, we'll have no one toblame but ourselves.<br1>
You must use extreme care when you go there.<br1>
Iseriously doubt that you will survive.<br1>
