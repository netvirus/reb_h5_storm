A few monthsago, hundreds of her works were excavated in Innadril.<br1>
Galfredo Romer'sBust was one of them.<br1>
He was one of my ancestors who was as an aid tothe Emperor! It is recorded in my family's genealogy! If you don'tbelive me, I'll show it to you! Anyway, I sent my nephew to Innadril tobuy all the sculptures for me.<br1>
But, while they were being delivered tome, they were stolen by orc bandits.<br1>
I'm very upset with my nephew! Itold him repeatedly to hire guards! Ahem! So, here's the deal.<br1>
