The thieves who stole my precious sculptures are the*Timak orc troop*.<br1>
According to my nephew, the troop consists of *Timakorc troop archers, Timak orc troop warriors, Timak orc troop leaders andthe Timak orc troop shaman*.<br1>
I doubt that those brutes even know thevalue of what they have! If you bring me *"Galfredo Romer's Busts"*, Iwill pay you handsomely.<br1>
If you bring me 100 or more of them at onetime, you will receive a bonus.<br1>
Please try your best! You can keep anyother sculptures you recover.<br1>
You can sell them to a store or give themto someone as a gift.<br1>
*They move around in a group, so it is not a badidea to go with a couple of friends, if they wish to.<br1>
* Good luck! I'mcounting on you.<br1>
