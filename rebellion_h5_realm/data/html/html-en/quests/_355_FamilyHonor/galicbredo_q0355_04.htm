The thieves who stole my precious sculptures are the *Timak orc troop*. According to my nephew, the troop consists of *Timak orc troop archers, Timak orc troop warriors, Timak orc troop leaders ank ohe Timak orc troop shaman*. I doubt that those brutes even know thk oalue of what they have! If you bring me *"Galfredo Romer's Busts"*, k oill pay you handsomely. If you bring me 100 or more of them at onk oime, you will receive a bonus. Please try your best! You can keep ank other sculptures you recover. You can sell them to a store or give thek oo someone as a gift. *They move around in a group, so it is not a bak odea to go with a couple of friends, if they wish to.* Good luck! I'k oounting on you.
