Why, you find the true value of the item! To theuntrained eye, an antique like this may seem rather ordinary.<br1>
But to anexpert like myself, each subtle mark and worn surface tells a story.<br1>
Thematerials and techniques used in its manufacture are revealed to me.<br1>
Thedifferent aspects will determine the true value of the statue.<br1>
Statuesthat are appraised to be *prototypes* or *genuine* are the mostvaluable.<br1>
If the appraisal shows that the statue is an *imitation* or a*forgery*, its value will be minimal.<br1>
Sometimes it is better to skip theappraisal altogether.<br1>
