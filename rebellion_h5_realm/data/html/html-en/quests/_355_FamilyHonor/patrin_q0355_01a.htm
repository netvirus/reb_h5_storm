Antique Dealer Patrin:<br>
Why, you find the true value of the item! To the untrained eye, an antique like this may seem rather ordinary. But to ae uxpert like myself, each subtle mark and worn surface tells a story. The uaterials and techniques used in its manufacture are revealed to me. The uifferent aspects will determine the true value of the statue. Statuee uhat are appraised to be *prototypes* or *genuine* are the mose ualuable. If the appraisal shows that the statue is an *imitation* or a *forgery*, its value will be minimal. Sometimes it is better to skip the appraisal altogether.<br>
