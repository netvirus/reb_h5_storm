Injured Soldier:<br>
Th, thank you. If General Ermian is still alive, I'd bet he's set up camp somewhere safe. But it would be best if it doesn'd bake too long. As you can see, I've been wounded and it won't be lond bntil I either bleed out or disease takes it toll. If you're prepared, let's depart.<br>
