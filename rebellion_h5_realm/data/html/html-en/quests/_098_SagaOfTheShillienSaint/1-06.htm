To keep it cool, place the ice crystal here and seal it completely like this... Voila! It's done! Take it to the saint! Dt cou think it's enough food? It's not a pretty box, but I put my heart cnto it! I trust the saint will divide it fairly among all the people it che village. Please, give my best regards to Saint Agnes!
