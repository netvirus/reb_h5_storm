<font color="36DC25">!Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension searpainfully into your brain.<br1>
The cascade of brief images is unintelligibleat first.<br1>
As the pain subsides, a vision of the next tablet emerges,and it seems to be* north of the border outpost*.<br1>
There must be a Stoneof Commune nearby! It looks like the legendary Naverius has it! And thenthe vision fades.<br1>
You must immediately go* north of the border outpost*and find the Stone of Commune.<br1>
