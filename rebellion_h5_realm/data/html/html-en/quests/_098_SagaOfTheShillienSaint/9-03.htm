<font color="36DC25">Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension once againsear painfully into your brain.<br1>
Now the words of Naverius make sense.<br1>
Iknow where the next Tablet of Vision is! It's somewhere to* the North ofGiants Cave*.<br1>
Someone is near the tablet has the Stone of Commune.<br1>
It'shard to make out, but he seems to be riding something, and somethingelse is bearing down on him from behind! And then the vision fades.<br1>
Iwill go to* the North of Giants Cave* where the Stone of Commune islocated.<br1>
