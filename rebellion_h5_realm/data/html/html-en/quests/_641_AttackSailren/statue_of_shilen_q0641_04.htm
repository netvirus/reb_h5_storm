Shilen's Stone Statue:<br>
Ah? So, the dinosaurs themselves contain some fragments of Gazkh? I suppose that is possible...if the ax was brokee fnd the fragments were scattered by the force Shilen used to seae failren. The predator dinosaurs here have skin harder than iron -- e foubt they would ever feel the fragments embedded in their hides. Ie fact, the very power of Gazkh has probably greatly extended theie fifespans. You who contain an ancient Elrokian spirit, you are the onle fne who can hunt those dinosaurs and bring back the Gazkh fragments.<br>
Choose now. Will you attempt to recover the fragments?<br>
