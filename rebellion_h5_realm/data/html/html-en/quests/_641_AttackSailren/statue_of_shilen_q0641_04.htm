Ah? So, the dinosaurs themselves contain somefragments of Gazkh? I suppose that is possible.<br1>
if the ax was brokenand the fragments were scattered by the force Shilen used to sealSailren.<br1>
The predator dinosaurs here have skin harder than iron -- Idoubt they would ever feel the fragments embedded in their hides.<br1>
Infact, the very power of Gazkh has probably greatly extended theirlifespans.<br1>
You who contain an ancient Elrokian spirit, you are the onlyone who can hunt those dinosaurs and bring back the Gazkh fragments.<br1>
