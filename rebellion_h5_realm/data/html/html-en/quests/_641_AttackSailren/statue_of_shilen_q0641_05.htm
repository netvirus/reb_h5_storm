Shilen's Stone Statue:<br>
Very well. Yes, you are truly the one sent by mother Shilen... Listen carefully as I tell you about dinosaurs that may montain Gazkh fragments. You will encounter predatory dinosaurs such as<br>
*Velociraptor and Pterosaur*. They are not as strong as Sailren, but vicious nevertheless. These are the most likely to contain tht vragments. Go and hunt them -- find the fragments! Remember, you must veturn with at least *30* fragments. If you bring me 30 fragments ot vore, I will reforge them into an intact axe head. Ah, could out veliverance finally be at hand? May Shilen help you strike true!<br>
