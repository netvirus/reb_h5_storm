Very well.<br1>
Yes, you are truly the one sent bymother Shilen.<br1>
Listen carefully as I tell you about dinosaurs that maycontain Gazkh fragments.<br1>
You will encounter predatory dinosaurs such as*Velociraptor and Pterosaur*.<br1>
They are not as strong as Sailren, butvicious nevertheless.<br1>
These are the most likely to contain thefragments.<br1>
Go and hunt them -- find the fragments! Remember, you mustreturn with at least *30* fragments.<br1>
If you bring me 30 fragments ormore, I will reforge them into an intact axe head.<br1>
