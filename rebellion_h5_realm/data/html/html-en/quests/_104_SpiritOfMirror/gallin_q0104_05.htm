So you have captured all the escaped spirits!Thank you! In the meantime, I have reconstructed all of the magicbarriers around the school, and the spirits will not escape again.<br1>
Iwill give you this as a reward for your work.<br1>
It may not look like much,but it is a helpful item which brings out the inner magic potential ofthe user.<br1>
As Einhovant has always said, true power comes from within.<br1>
