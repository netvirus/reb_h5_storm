I don't know why, but the magic defense fieldthat I erected around the school of magic disappeared a few days ago.<br1>
Ihave restored most of the shields, but I am worried that the spiritsthat were kept within the school for research have escaped to theoutside.<br1>
If some spirits have escaped, I may have to ask you to go andcapture them .<br1>
