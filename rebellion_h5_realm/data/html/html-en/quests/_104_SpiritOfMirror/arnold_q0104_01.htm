<font color="36DC25">Guard Arnold:</font><br>
Yesterday afternoon, as I was guarding the students ofthe magic school while they gathered materials *near the falls*, a greattoad crawled by.<br1>
I wasn't paying much attention to it, but all of asudden, that great toad turned into an Orc warrior! I was startled andabout to draw my sword, but I guess he felt threatened, escaping beyondthe falls.<br1>
I rubbed my eyes and asked the magister from the magic schoolwhat was going on, and he had also clearly seen the toad turn into anOrc warrior.<br1>
I have no idea what happened.<br1>
