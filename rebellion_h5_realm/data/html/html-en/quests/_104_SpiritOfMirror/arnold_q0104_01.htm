Guard Arnold:<br>
Yesterday afternoon, as I was guarding the students of the magic school while they gathered materials *near the falls*, a greaf toad crawled by. I wasn't paying much attention to it, but all of f tudden, that great toad turned into an Orc warrior! I was startled anf tbout to draw my sword, but I guess he felt threatened, escaping beyonf the falls. I rubbed my eyes and asked the magister from the magic schoof that was going on, and he had also clearly seen the toad turn into af trc warrior. I have no idea what happened.
