Recently I have been studying the *spirit ofmirrors*.<br1>
This spirit does not have a set form and reflects the form ofothers, like a mirror.<br1>
The name spirit of mirrors comes from that trait.<br1>
I think that the magical creature called the doppelganger may also be anevolved form of the spirit of mirrors.<br1>
But there has been a problem! Idon't know why, but the magic defense field that I built around theSchool of Magic disappeared a few days ago.<br1>
Three of the spirits ofmirrors kept in my research lab escaped during that time.<br1>
I need torecapture the escaped spirits before they harm anyone, but my priorityis in examining the shields around the magic school.<br1>
So, please help me.<br1>
Do you think you can find the spirits of mirrors for me? If you help, Iwill give you the *wand of the adept* as a reward.<br1>
It is a very usefulweapon for those walking the path of a mage.<br1>
