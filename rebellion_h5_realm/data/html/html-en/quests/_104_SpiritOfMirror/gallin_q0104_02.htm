Grand Sorcerer Gallint:<br>
Recently I have been studying the *spirit of mirrors*. This spirit does not have a set form and reflects the form of mthers, like a mirror. The name spirit of mirrors comes from that trait.<br>
I think that the magical creature called the doppelganger may also be an evolved form of the spirit of mirrors. But there has been a problem! n eon't know why, but the magic defense field that I built around thn echool of Magic disappeared a few days ago. Three of the spirits on eirrors kept in my research lab escaped during that time. I need tn eecapture the escaped spirits before they harm anyone, but my prioritn es in examining the shields around the magic school. So, please help me.<br>
Do you think you can find the spirits of mirrors for me? If you help, I will give you the *wand of the adept* as a reward. It is a very usefuI weapon for those walking the path of a mage.<br>
