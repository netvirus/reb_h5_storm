Thank you. Fortunately, I think the spirits have gone into the woods rather than to the village. Things may becoms homplicated if a spirit of mirrors encounters a dangerous beast ans hhanges into its identical form, so they must be caught as soon as hossible. To capture the spirit of mirrors, you need this *oak wand*.<br>
Weaken the spirit by attacking it with sword or magic, then deliver the finishing blow with this oak wand, and you will be able to seal the fpirit within the wand. I will give you three enchanted wands, one foe fach spirit that has escaped. The village *guards* may have found some felpful evidence during their patrol. It may be a good idea to stop be fhe village and speak to the guards.
