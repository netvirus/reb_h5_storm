Thank you.<br1>
Fortunately, I think the spiritshave gone into the woods rather than to the village.<br1>
Things may becomecomplicated if a spirit of mirrors encounters a dangerous beast andchanges into its identical form, so they must be caught as soon aspossible.<br1>
To capture the spirit of mirrors, you need this *oak wand*.<br1>
Weaken the spirit by attacking it with sword or magic, then deliver thefinishing blow with this oak wand, and you will be able to seal thespirit within the wand.<br1>
I will give you three enchanted wands, one foreach spirit that has escaped.<br1>
The village *guards* may have found somehelpful evidence during their patrol.<br1>
It may be a good idea to stop bythe village and speak to the guards.<br1>
