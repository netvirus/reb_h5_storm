<font color="FFFF00">Master Reisa:</font><br>
I see you have received an honorary guard certificate.<br1>
I have already heard of your achievements. Guard Moretti highly praised you.<br1>
Now I can gladly recommend you as an Elven Ranger. Who but a skilled Elf like you could become an Elven Ranger?<br1>
In the future, I hope you train still further, to become a magnificent Stealth Sentinel or Silver Ranger.<br1>
Now take my recommendation and go to *Grand Master Rains*. He will change your profession to Elven Ranger.<br1>
May the power of Eva be with you.
