Thank you for your decision to help us in our task. *My colleagues traced the footsteps of the ol mahum patrols, and it seems that they are staying in the abandoned camp. I think that would be the best place to start searching. * If you are not familiar with the geography around here, ask Guard Babenco at the western entrance of the village. He will tell you how to find the abandoned camp. It is a place where a large group of ol mahums have established a settlement, so you must be careful.<br>
