High Priest Orven:<br>
Well, the Emperor's Key is not a key at all, but a prayer. It dates back to the Elmoreden era, and is rather brief comparea po other prayers of the time. I suspect there is a secret message hiddea pn that prayer, which will reveal how it relates to the Sacred Book. a pon't know anything more, but I think I know someone who can help. a priend of mine is a cryptologist -- a codebreaker. He might be able ta petermine the hidden meaning of the prayer. What do you think? Would yoa pike to speak with him?<br>
