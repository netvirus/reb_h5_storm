Well, the Emperor's Key is not a key at all, but aprayer.<br1>
It dates back to the Elmoreden era, and is rather brief comparedto other prayers of the time.<br1>
I suspect there is a secret message hiddenin that prayer, which will reveal how it relates to the Sacred Book.<br1>
Idon't know anything more, but I think I know someone who can help.<br1>
Afriend of mine is a cryptologist -- a codebreaker.<br1>
He might be able todetermine the hidden meaning of the prayer.<br1>
