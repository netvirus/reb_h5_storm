Oh my.<br1>
I wonder if it was after you.<br1>
or the sacredtext? Well, that settles it.<br1>
Give me that manuscript and the object youfound and I'll keep them safe.<br1>
You must be exhausted! Rest for a while.<br1>
When you've refreshed yourself, then come back and see me.<br1>
By then,perhaps Franz will be back as well.<br1>
