I'm so sorry: document number 1667was lost in the great fire.<br1>
However, there is a copy.<br1>
a handwritten,incomplete copy.<br1>
It is a mysterious record in its own right--we have norecord of its title, year of publication, author, or subject.<br1>
I wonderif anyone has actually read it? Well, I'm going to need to see someidentification before I can turn this over.<br1>
