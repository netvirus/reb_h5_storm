Mysterious Necromancer:<br>
Ah! You're looking for the elder too, aren't you?<br1>
Lots of folks looking for him these days...<br1>
This is getting old! Do I look like a street sign to you?<br1>
Anyway, past the Entrance of the Saints, you'll see the valley.<br1>
Go to the deepest part of the valley and enter the cave.<br1>
You'll find the elder there.
