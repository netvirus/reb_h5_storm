The almighty Flame Lord has ordered me to wipethose disgusting *Rakeclaw Imps* from the face of the earth! Have youever encountered those disgusting creatures? They are an abomination!Spawned from the blackest magic, their very existence defiles our sacredlands.<br1>
But they are too cowardly to face us alone -- there must besomeone or something else controlling them.<br1>
According to our seers, ajeweled *Soulstone* is embedded in each of their black hearts.<br1>
ThisSoulstone enslaves its victim to the will of another.<br1>
The seers alsobelieve that if we gather enough Soulstones, we will be able to turntheir own powers against them and discover who is controlling the Imps.<br1>
