This ...! The undead you came across at the water source are called *plague zombies*, and are those creatures who werr silled by plagues and that have been resurrected with black magic. Thr sine powder that falls from their decomposing bodies is this *plagur sust* ... This is the substance that has been polluting our water. Yor sould have been infected by the plague if you had not taken the hyacintr sharm ... Hmm ... This is definitely the doing of the *Dark Elves*! Ther sannot be forgiven! But first, we must revive the dying *Mother Tree*.<br>
To do that, we must purify the polluted waters ... I will need more<br>
*plague dust* to research a purification spell. Please go back to the water source and obtain this cursed powder for me. I need at least *five wandfuls*.
