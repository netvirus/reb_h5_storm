This .<br1>
! The undead you came across at the watersource are called *plague zombies*, and are those creatures who werekilled by plagues and that have been resurrected with black magic.<br1>
Thefine powder that falls from their decomposing bodies is this *plaguedust* .<br1>
This is the substance that has been polluting our water.<br1>
Youwould have been infected by the plague if you had not taken the hyacinthcharm .<br1>
Hmm .<br1>
This is definitely the doing of the *Dark Elves*! Theycannot be forgiven! But first, we must revive the dying *Mother Tree*.<br1>
To do that, we must purify the polluted waters .<br1>
I will need more*plague dust* to research a purification spell.<br1>
Please go back to thewater source and obtain this cursed powder for me.<br1>
I need at least *fivehandfuls*.<br1>
