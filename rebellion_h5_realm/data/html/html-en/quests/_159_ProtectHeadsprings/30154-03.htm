I don't know if you've noticed, but the *MotherTree* in the middle of the village has been slowly withering.<br1>
Theprogress of the blight is so slow that it is hard to notice unless onepossesses high magic powers.<br1>
We do not wish to worry our brothers, andonly a few of us know this secret.<br1>
None of our ancestors' records showany incident of the *Mother Tree* withering.<br1>
I cannot shake the dreadthat something is terribly wrong.<br1>
As a result of my research, Idiscovered that the *Mother Tree* is withering because the water is fullof contaminants that dry up the tree's roots.<br1>
It is my guess thatsomeone is polluting the water source of the river that flows into thevillage.<br1>
But I cannot guess who that someone is.<br1>
That someone would dareto pollute our life source, our water, in this chaotic time of waragainst the Misty Mountain orcs .<br1>
This cannot be left alone, it mustbe dealt with.<br1>
The sentinels cannot be spared, as they must defend thevillage, and all of our Rangers have been sent to the woods inpreparation for our battle with the orcs.<br1>
You must go to the watersource and find out the reason behind the pollution.<br1>
