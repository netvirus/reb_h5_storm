Have you felt anything strange lately while walkingaround the village? I recently saw yellow, withered leaves on thesurface of the pond in the middle of the village, under the *MotherTree*.<br1>
I don't know why a tree that has grown for thousands of yearsshould suddenly drop discolored, withered leaves.<br1>
I am very worried.<br1>
Iwill delve deeper into this, but if further investigation is necessary,I may have to ask you to aid me in investigating this matter.<br1>
