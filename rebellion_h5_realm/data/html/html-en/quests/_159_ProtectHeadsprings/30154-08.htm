Well done.<br1>
This will be enough to research thepurification magic.<br1>
As soon as the magic is complete, I will travelunder the protection of the sentinels to the water source and performthe purification spell, and eradicate any plague zombies that may yetremain.<br1>
My young kinsman, you have performed a great deed for our sacred*Mother Tree Glade* and for the *Elven* race.<br1>
I will give you this as atribute to your brave deed.<br1>
It may not seem like much, but it will comein handy one day, so keep it well.<br1>
