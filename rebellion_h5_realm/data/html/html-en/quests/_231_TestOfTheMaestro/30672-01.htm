Ah, those trespassers I caught in this cave? He he he,you should have heard their screams as their limbs were torn off one byone.<br1>
They didn't stop until I lopped off their heads! The one thatcursed the loudest escaped somehow.<br1>
But he is as good as dead.<br1>
He hassurely become a lovely meal for the evil eye Lord that stalks this cave.<br1>
He he he.<br1>
