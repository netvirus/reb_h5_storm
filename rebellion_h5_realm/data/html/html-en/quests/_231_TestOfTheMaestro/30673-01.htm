Let's talk about the research paper afterwards! Oneof the research team was poisoned by a monster in the dungeon! Hemanaged to escape from the monster, but if he doesn't have his antidotequickly, he'll die soon! Fortunately, we can find all the materials forthe antidote around here.<br1>
But we are short of people! You said youwere an adventurer? We need 10 Needles of Weird Bees, 10 units ofLeech's Blood, and 10 Cobwebs of Swamp Spider from the swamp area rightnow.<br1>
Can you find these things, please? We'll talk about the researchpaper after we have saved my colleague.<br1>
