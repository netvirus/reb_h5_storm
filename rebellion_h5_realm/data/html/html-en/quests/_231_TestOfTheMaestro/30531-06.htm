<font color="FF8000">First Elder Lockirin:</font><br>
Let's see, yes they are all here.<br1>
I am impressed!I'm sure the other Elders are preoccupied with the upcoming election.<br1>
Did you learn much from them? Many people covet this position and wouldlike it for themselves.<br1>
Many also fail to realize the deep significanceit holds for all of us Dwarves.<br1>
I pray that you become a perceptive andfar-sighted Warsmith.<br1>
