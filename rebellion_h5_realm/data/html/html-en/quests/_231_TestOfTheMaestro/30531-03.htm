<font color="FF8000">First Elder Lockirin:</font><br>
It has been a long time since a Dwarf has come totake the Maestro test.<br1>
Youngsters these days do not appreciate thebenefits of hard work.<br1>
You are a notable exception, my ambitious youngfriend.<br1>
Actually,it is far too easy to become a Maestro these days.<br1>
Inthe days of my youth the test was so intense that the stress would oftencause physical disfigurement! Many ended up looking like Elves! Thesedays you only need to get recommendations from the 3 Elders.<br1>
