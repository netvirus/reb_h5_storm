The products of the Black Anvil Guild are considered thecutting edge of Dwarven technology.<br1>
We are responsible for therenaissance of the ancient giants' technology.<br1>
If I become guild master,I intend to double the pace of our technological development, andDwarves will take a new place among the races.<br1>
So, you want a letterof Recommendation.<br1>
Such things do not come freely.<br1>
A mobile teleportdevice developed by our guild was recently stolen.<br1>
We suspect MasterToma, but our guild cannot investigate directly.<br1>
Meet Master Toma tofind out if he has the device.<br1>
If he does, get it from him and return itto me.<br1>
He might be either in the Dead Pit or at the entrance of MithrilMines, east of the village, or on the northern seashore.<br1>
He is alwayswandering around here and there.<br1>
We will talk about the recommendationletter afterwards.<br1>
