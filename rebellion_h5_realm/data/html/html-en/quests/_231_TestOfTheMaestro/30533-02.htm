Well, I can't go into details, but it concerns thedelivery of a certain item.<br1>
I don't know how the news leaked out, but itseems that every thief around here is targeting our wagon.<br1>
I havedecided to hire some Guards.<br1>
The Orcs are perfect for this job.<br1>
But whenI tried to hire them, the Orcs staying in the town would not listen! Doyou think you can go and persuade them? The Orc Leader's name is Krotoor something like that.<br1>
All I ask is that you extract a promise fromthem that they will send some of their mercenaries.<br1>
