<font color="36DC25">Elder Filaur:</font><br>
I don't mind writing you a letter of recommendation, butfirst you must do something for me.<br1>
In anticipation of next year's FirstElder election our guild is planning to construct an amazing building.<br1>
Our current skills are not up to the task.<br1>
We require the technology ofthe ancient giants! If we can secure that our dreams will becomereality.<br1>
Certainly you know of the Cruma Tower? It is where the skillsof the ancient giants are preserved.<br1>
I have heard that a scout team fromthe Black Anvil Guild is there, too.<br1>
They are led by a woman namedLoraine or something like that.<br1>
Go and obtain the technology fromthem.<br1>
Do what you must.<br1>
