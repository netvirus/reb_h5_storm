<font color="FF8000">Chief Croto:</font><br>
Truthfully, we were exiled from the holy land and havebeen living in a foreign village.<br1>
The bitterest pill to swallow is thatthe altar of our ancestors is in the hands of our betrayers.<br1>
I havetried and failed several times to retrieve the altar which is being keptin the Cave of Trial.<br1>
This year we sent the army and not one hasreturned.<br1>
My nephew Kamuru is among the lost.<br1>
Possibly lost in thecave or killed by the monster.<br1>
Anyway, if something has happened tohim I won't be able to face my sister.<br1>
Let us make a bargain.<br1>
Go to theCave of Trial and find out what has happened to Kamuru.<br1>
If he was killedby monsters, bring his belongings to me.<br1>
