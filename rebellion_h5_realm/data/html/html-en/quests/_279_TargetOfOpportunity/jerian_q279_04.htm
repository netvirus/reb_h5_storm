Alright, here's what you need to do.<br1>
Defeat the<font color="LEVEL">Cosmic Scout, Cosmic Watcher, Cosmic Priest,	and Cosmic Lord</font>.<br1>
You will pick up a<font color="LEVEL">fragment of their essence</font>after defeating them.<br1>
Assemble these parts and you will have a SealBreaker, a stone that will allow you to travel directly to Ranku andDemon Prince by fooling the Tower's Seal into thinking you a devil.<br1>
Bring the parts to me and I can convert them.<br1>
