Oh, thank you so much, that's really cool of you.<br1>
Iwish I was tough like you.<br1>
or heck, even as tough as my little nieceGretzka.<br1>
She's a tough little cookie.<br1>
Anyway, that's not important.<br1>
Whatis important is that you bring me samples of the plants on the Plains.<br1>
Ineed<font color="LEVEL">one bag of spores from the Fantasy Mushroom</font>,<font color="LEVEL">one bag of spores from the Sticky Mushroom</font>, and<font color="LEVEL">one leaf from the Energy Plant</font>.<br1>
All of these can be found on the Plains.<br1>
