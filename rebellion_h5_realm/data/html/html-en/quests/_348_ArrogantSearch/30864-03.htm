That is really good news.<br1>
I like the kind of peoplelike you.<br1>
Anyway, here is what I wish of you for now: go to the GiantsCave, defeat a *Lesser Giant Elder* or a *Lesser Giant Mage* and bringback the Titan's Powerstone that they carry.<br1>
I only need one stone, soit shouldn't be too hard for you.<br1>
