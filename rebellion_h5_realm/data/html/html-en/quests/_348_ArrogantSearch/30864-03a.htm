You are not thinking about quiting already, do you?Have you forgotten what I asked of you? Here is what I wish of you fornow: go to the Giants Cave, defeat a *Lesser Giant Elder* or a *LesserGiant Mage* and bring back the Titan's Powerstone that they carry.<br1>
Ionly need one stone, so it shouldn't be too hard for you.<br1>
