A long time ago, three sacred relics were lockedaway and hidden away.<br1>
In time, people have managed to find somemysterious treasure boxes that are thought to contain the relics.<br1>
However, they are all guarded by strong monsters.<br1>
so naturally, youwill have to kill these guardians in order to get the relics! Meet with*Claudia Athebaldt* in Aden Castle Town, *Martien* in Giran Castle Townand *Magister Harne* in Dark Elven Village.<br1>
At each meeting you will begiven the location of an ark containing a sacred relic.<br1>
They will markon the map the location of each ark with a red flag.<br1>
Once you find andretrieve a sacred relic, the red mark will disappear.<br1>
Now, go andcollect the three sacred relics.<br1>
(If a flag disappears before you find asacred relic, return to the person who marked its location on the mapand make your inquiry again.<br1>
The flag will reappear).<br1>
I have given you aletter to give to each of them.<br1>
I explain everything to them there.<br1>
