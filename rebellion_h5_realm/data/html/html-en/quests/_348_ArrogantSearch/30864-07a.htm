You are back again.<br1>
but you are not done with thelast task I asked of you.<br1>
Listen carefully: You need to dip the cloth inthe blood of a *Platinum Tribe Overlord* or a *Platinum Tribe Shaman*.<br1>
Once you have made the cloth completely red from their blood, come backto me and I promise to tell you a secret.<br1>
