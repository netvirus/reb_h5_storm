So.<br1>
you have managed to obtain the blood of thePlatinum Tribe as I asked of you.<br1>
You probably came back to hear thesecret I promised to tell you, didn't you? If you remember, when youfirst started working for me, I had asked you if you were curious aboutthat mysterious, swirling vortex over the tower of an ancient king.<br1>
Thesecret of this vortex lies within the blood you have collected in thisfabric! If you offer this blood to the vortex, you will be teleportedbehind the sealed door and you will be able to wake up the demented kingBaium! Be careful, however, for he has gone completely mad and he ismuch too powerful to handle on your own! Be sure to go with a largegroup of allies should you ever wish to confront him! Of course, allyour friends must also gain their entrance to his room.<br1>
