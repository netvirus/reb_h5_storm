Many, many thanks! I will put this food in thewarehouse and give it to people at dinner time and from there, lead themto the Path of Light.<br1>
Thanks to your help, I can now give happiness tothese people.<br1>
Your noble sacrifice will not be forgotten.<br1>
Actually, ifI recall, you came to me for the way to go on.<br1>
Before you, someonecalled* Elikia* came to me to talk as well.<br1>
It appears that you both arewalking through similar paths.<br1>
So I will share with you what I sharedwith* Elikia*.<br1>
This is the Stone of Commune.<br1>
I heard if you bring thisto the Tablet of Vision, you will get additional knowledge.<br1>
To visit theTablet of Vision with this stone, go to* the south of the Tower ofInsolence*.<br1>
