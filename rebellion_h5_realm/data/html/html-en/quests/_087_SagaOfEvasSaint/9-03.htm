<font color="36DC25">Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension once againsear painfully into your brain.<br1>
Now, the words of Haures make sense! Iknow where the next Tablet of Vision is! It's* southeast of Rune CastleTown*.<br1>
Someone near the tablet has the Stone of Commune.<br1>
It's hard tomake out, but he seems to be riding something, and something else isbearing down on him from behind! And then the vision fades.<br1>
