Hello! I've been expecting you! Don't look sosurprised! You must have come to me because of the power of Stone ofCommune you feel from me? I got this one from Agnes a while back.<br1>
Don'tyou wonder how she got it and why she gave it to me? If you knew her,you would understand! While you were away, there was an accident inGoddard Castle Town.<br1>
Agnes provided food for the townspeople, and afterthe accident, everyone, including myself, came to rely upon her.<br1>
