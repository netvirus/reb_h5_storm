All spirits in the ancient forest used to be friends to usElves.<br1>
But recently, some spirits have become violent.<br1>
It's as if theywere trying to get revenge on the Elves for the destruction of theforest.<br1>
I heard it was the angry wind spirit 'lirein' that recentlycaused the strong wind to destroy the roofs of the village buildings andbreak windows.<br1>
If the 'sylph' is the spirit of the cool breeze thatblows between trees, then 'lirein' is a vengeful spirit of a wild storm.<br1>
These spirits pluck trees from their roots and send animals flying highin the air.<br1>
They are especially hostile to Elves.<br1>
They come and go withsevere winds, and we feel like they are trying to drive us from theforest.<br1>
However, the 'wind shard,' a fragment of 'soul ore' that iswithin the body of a lirein, is a very precious resource.<br1>
I useelemental stones to make various magic products, but among them, thewind shard is a material inevitably needed when making the 'scroll ofwind'.<br1>
The scroll of wind is just as its name implies -- wind that istrapped in parchment.<br1>
If you spread the scroll wide open, the strongwind sealed within will blow in the direction of your choice for a fewseconds.<br1>
This can be very useful for various tasks.<br1>
It is used to changethe direction of the wind east, to prevent the poisonous fumes comingfrom the Sea of Spores from entering the Elven forest.<br1>
The scroll ofwind is also bought by many Human and Dwarven sea navigators.<br1>
I heard itis used when there is no wind on the ocean and the ship cannot move.<br1>
Iam making several scrolls of wind due to the commission of Herbiel, butI am short of a few materials.<br1>
