All spirits in the ancient forest used to be friends to usElves.<br1>
But recently, some spirits have become violent.<br1>
It's as if theywere trying to get revenge on the Elves for the destruction of theforest.<br1>
I heard it was the angry wind spirit 'lirein' that recentlycaused the strong wind to destroy the roofs of the village buildings andbreak windows.<br1>
If the 'sylph' is the spirit of the cool breeze thatblows between trees, then 'lirein' is a vengeful spirit of a wild storm.<br1>
These spirits pluck trees from their roots and send animals flying highin the air.<br1>
They are especially hostile to Elves.<br1>
They come and go withsevere winds, and we feel like they are trying to drive us from theforest.<br1>
However, the 'wind shard,' a fragment of 'soul ore' that iswithin the body of a lirein, is a very precious resource.<br1>
I make variousmagical products using soul ore, so I may ask you to collect some windshards for me in the near future.<br1>
