In the church, we teach nonresistance, peace andsacrifice.<br1>
But sometimes I can't help questioning myself, if followingtheir lessons are only short term good deeds.<br1>
The world out there isfull of evil and yet we are sitting here in the shrine doing nothing butpraying, training, giving remedies and almsgiving.<br1>
Sometimes I thinkthat.<br1>
I wish I could make a better world, where good people can livein peace.<br1>
With the help of the power of light which Einhasad grantedus.<br1>
Oh my.<br1>
I talked too much.<br1>
Forget what I said until now.<br1>
The HighPriest once scolded me for having too radical thoughts.<br1>
You must becareful since others may take you as a heretic.<br1>
