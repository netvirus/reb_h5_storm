<font color="36DC25">Priestess Rupino:</font><br>
It is an honor to meet a person who has the samethoughts as me.<br1>
I suppose those who are enlightened will worry suchworries.<br1>
You are prohibited to speak out such stories, though.<br1>
Thoseare taboo and are not allowed in here.<br1>
I will give you this book.<br1>
Readit when you have the time.<br1>
But first, go to the execution place of Dion.<br1>
Perhaps it might help you to find the answers to some of yourquestions.<br1>
Knock off the *anonymous spirits* wandering around theexecution place.<br1>
The only thing that you should keep in mind is that youmust hit the last strike, with the magic of disrupt undead.<br1>
