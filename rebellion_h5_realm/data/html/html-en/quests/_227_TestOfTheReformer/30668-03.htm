Darn it! I would have never guessed, a betrayer.<br1>
! Wait,there is no guarantee that the betrayer has come only to this place! Iam worried about the other meeting places.<br1>
I don't know what kind ofperson he is, but I can guess the way he is thinking.<br1>
Anyway, pleasetake this letter to my master.<br1>
He will give some sort of orders.<br1>
Goodbye.<br1>
