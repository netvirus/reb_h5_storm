I made a wise decision in sending you.<br1>
It might have beentoo difficult for Katari to manage all alone.<br1>
By the way, what isthat? Is that Ol Mahum money? It's useless.<br1>
You'd better throw thataway.<br1>
As you know, I have one more thing that requires your help.<br1>
There are some Ol Mahums who recently converted to my teachings, afterbeing touched by my lecture on the tenet of light a few days ago.<br1>
Butthe opposition from the church was so strong that I had to ask my pupilsto shelter them in a safe place.<br1>
We split them into 3 groups, and sentthem to Talking Island, Orc Town of the northern region, and the DwarvenVillage.<br1>
But I haven't heard any news from them.<br1>
I am veryworried.<br1>
with the recent Ol Mahum campsite incident and all.<br1>
Wouldyou go and check how they are doing for me? I'll write you 3 letters togive to my disciples.<br1>
.<br1>
First, go and meet Kakan.<br1>
She said that she wouldsettle down in a place southeast of Orc Town.<br1>
