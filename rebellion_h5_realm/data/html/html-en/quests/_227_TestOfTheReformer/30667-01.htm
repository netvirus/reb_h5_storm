Oh my God! You have come this far for this? Thank you.<br1>
How ismy master? Things here are going so well.<br1>
, too well that it makes meworried sometimes.<br1>
The people here are much more open minded compared toother places.<br1>
We are planning a big assembly in the Elven relics ofTalking Island, and we decided to hold a memorial service beforehand tocalm down the magic creatures.<br1>
Ah, I see! Would it be possible for youto gather the bone pieces? Gather a piece of bone from every undead inthe relic.<br1>
Please take a look at this diagram.<br1>
This task is.<br1>
gathering the bones for the memorial service so it has to be done by thePriests firsthand.<br1>
