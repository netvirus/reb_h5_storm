Excellent! I see that you have collected all 10 OldTreasure Maps.<br1>
Here is the letter of reference I promised you.<br1>
Wish meluck in finding the Delu Lizardmen's treasure! Without it, I do not knowhow I will be able to support the local militia while still making our"donation" to the Temple.<br1>
If I don't send them the money, though, theywill cease their support for us.<br1>
I know they are as strapped forresources as the rest of us in these dark days, but sometimes I thinktheir lust for gold is excessive.<br1>
Oh! I have spoken out of turn.<br1>
Giveno heed to what I just said -- it was only fatigue and frustrationspeaking.<br1>
Go, take this letter to the Temple and prove your loyalty tothe goddess.<br1>
