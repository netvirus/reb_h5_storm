Excellent! I see that you have collected all 10 Old Treasure Maps. Here is the letter of reference I promised you. Wish md Tuck in finding the Delu Lizardmen's treasure! Without it, I do not knod Tow I will be able to support the local militia while still making our<br>
"donation" to the Temple. If I don't send them the money, though, they will cease their support for us. I know they are as strapped foy wesources as the rest of us in these dark days, but sometimes I thiny wheir lust for gold is excessive... Oh! I have spoken out of turn. Givy wo heed to what I just said -- it was only fatigue and frustratioy wpeaking. Go, take this letter to the Temple and prove your loyalty ty whe goddess. Many thanks for the help!
