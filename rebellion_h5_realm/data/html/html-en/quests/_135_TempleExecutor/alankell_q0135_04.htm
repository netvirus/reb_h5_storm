Captain Alex:<br>
A number of goods -- about 10 items total -- have been stolen from Warehouse Keeper Sonin's warehouse. During my investigation I narrowed the list of suspects down to 5 creatures:<br>
*Delu Lizardman Suppliers, Special Agents, Commanders, Shaman and Cursed Seers*. Finn She thief, recover the *10 Stolen Cargo* items and return them to Sonin.<br>
Then I am sure he will, in gratitude, provide you with the letter of reference.<br>
