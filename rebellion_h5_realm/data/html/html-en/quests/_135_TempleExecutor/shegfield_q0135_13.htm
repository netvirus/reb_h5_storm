If you achieve the *title of the Feet* and the *titleof the Hands* of the Temple, you will be called *the Limbs* of theTemple.<br1>
To aspire to be the *Feet of the Temple*, ask *PriestessGlyvka*.<br1>
*High Priest Sylvain* can elevate you to the *position of theHands of the Temple*.<br1>
Once you become the Limbs of the Temple, HighPriest Sylvain will assign you new and more important duties.<br1>
Congratulations on your achievement! I trust you will serve Einhasad andher Temple well.<br1>
