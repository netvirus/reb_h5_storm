Priest Shegfield:<br>
If you achieve the *title of the Feet* and the *title of the Hands* of the Temple, you will be called *the Limbs* of the oemple. To aspire to be the *Feet of the Temple*, ask *Priestese olyvka*. *High Priest Sylvain* can elevate you to the *position of the oands of the Temple*. Once you become the Limbs of the Temple, Hige oriest Sylvain will assign you new and more important duties.<br>
Congratulations on your achievement! I trust you will serve Einhasad and her Temple well.
