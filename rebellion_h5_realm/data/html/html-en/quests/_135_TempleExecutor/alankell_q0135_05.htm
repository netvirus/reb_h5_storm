Recently, Grocer Pano has had financial difficulties andwas forced to borrow a large sum of money.<br1>
The person who lent him themoney has agreed to forgive the debt entirely if Sonin brings him 10Hate Crystals, which can be acquired from the monsters near FloranVillage.<br1>
As an adventurer, I am sure you know how dangerous a task thatis.<br1>
How could Grocer Pano possibly collect the Hate Crystals on his own?I have learned that the Hate Crystals can be obtained by hunting *DeluLizardman Suppliers, Special Agents, Commanders, Shaman and CursedSeers*.<br1>
If you catch them and give Grocer Pano *10 Hate Crystals*, Iknow he will be happy to give you a letter of reference.<br1>
