<font color="FF8000">Captain Alex:</font><br>
As you know, this village was built by poor peasantswithout any help from the nearby lord.<br1>
People make their living byclearing land for farming, but without the military protection of thenobility, they are vulnerable to monster attacks.<br1>
It has fallen to me totry to organize some sort of defense.<br1>
In order to do so, I need funds tobuy weapons and hire adventurers from the Temple.<br1>
I have heard a rumorthat the Delu Lizardmen hid a treasure near here, and that a map showingits location can be obtained by hunting *Delu Lizardman Suppliers,Special Agents, Commanders, Shaman and Cursed Seers*.<br1>
Would you bewilling to get me *10 Old Treasure Maps*? In exchange, I will write youthe letter of reference you require.<br1>
