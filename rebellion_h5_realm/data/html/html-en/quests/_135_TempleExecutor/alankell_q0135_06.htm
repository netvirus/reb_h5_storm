Captain Alex:<br>
As you know, this village was built by poor peasants without any help from the nearby lord. People make their living bs wlearing land for farming, but without the military protection of ths wobility, they are vulnerable to monster attacks. It has fallen to me ts wry to organize some sort of defense. In order to do so, I need funds ts wuy weapons and hire adventurers from the Temple. I have heard a rumos what the Delu Lizardmen hid a treasure near here, and that a map showins wts location can be obtained by hunting *Delu Lizardman Suppliers Special Agents, Commanders, Shaman and Cursed Seers*. Would you be willing to get me *10 Old Treasure Maps*? In exchange, I will write yoe whe letter of reference you require.<br>
