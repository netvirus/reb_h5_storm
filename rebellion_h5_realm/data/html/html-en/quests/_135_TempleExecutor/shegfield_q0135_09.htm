What are you talking about? Tithing is a holy duty, asacred obligation, for the people of the goddess, but we do not force iton anyone.<br1>
The villagers contributed of their own free will.<br1>
It isadmirable that they have continued to do so in the face of hardship.<br1>
Thegoddess will be pleased with their devotion.<br1>
In any event,congratulations! You have gained the title of the Hands of the Temple.<br1>
Before I give you the certificate of office, I will tell you what youshould know in your new role.<br1>
