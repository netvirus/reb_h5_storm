<font color="36DC25">!Priest Shegfield:</font><br>
After the creation of the world, there was a greatwar between the gods, including Shilen and Einhasad.<br1>
In the aftermath ofthis conflict, the Giants in their arrogance rebelled against Einhasadand inflicted grievous damage on the Celestial Realm before they werevanquished and their empire ground into dust.<br1>
Then the Elves and Orcswent to war, and the destruction affected many other species.<br1>
Finally,Humans emerged to rule this continent.<br1>
They did so only because ofEinhasad's blessing.<br1>
The first emperor of this united realm,Schuneimann, followed the instructions of Einhasad that he received froman angel with three wings.<br1>
Thanks in part to his patronage, this Templewas established.<br1>
Over time, Schuneimann's line became corrupted.<br1>
Following the reign of the despotic Emperor Baium, the empire split intotwo separate regions: Elmore in the North and Aden in the South.<br1>
Theseeds of chaos planted in those days have darkly flowered now, to thepoint that even an unknown adventurer can set himself up as the lord ofa castle.<br1>
But our Temple has never lost sight of our heritage andcontinues to remain true to the path laid out all those years ago.<br1>
