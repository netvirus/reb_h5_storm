I have no choice but to follow the orders of the Tetrarchs. This will not be easy for you. None of the five factions involved in this conflict have any use for weaklings! Ha! Listen carefully. You musn to and exterminate Tarlk bugbears and basilisks they are raising. Then tave been a nuisance to the Ol Mahums for too long. Bring back 30 proofn tf their demise. The fatal blows must be delivered by your clan leader. Now, what are you waiting for? Be gone!<br>
