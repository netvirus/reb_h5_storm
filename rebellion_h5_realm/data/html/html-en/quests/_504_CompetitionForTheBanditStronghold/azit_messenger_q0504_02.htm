I have no choice but to follow the orders of the Tetrarchs.<br1>
This will not be easy for you.<br1>
None of the five factions involved inthis conflict have any use for weaklings! Ha! Listen carefully.<br1>
You mustgo and exterminate Tarlk bugbears and basilisks they are raising.<br1>
Theyhave been a nuisance to the Ol Mahums for too long.<br1>
Bring back 30 proofsof their demise.<br1>
The fatal blows must be delivered by your clan leader.<br1>
