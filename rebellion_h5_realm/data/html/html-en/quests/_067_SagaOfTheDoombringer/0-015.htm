That is how the Age of the Giants ended.<br1>
After theypassed, the Elves became dominant, then the Orcs, and now the Humans.<br1>
But for those of us sealed within Arviterre Laboratory, which becameknown as the Isle of Souls, it was as if time had stopped.<br1>
Only thanksto a man in black armor who was able to penetrate the seal did we fromtime to time learn of the happenings in the wider world.<br1>
Then one day,the man came with a woman in a dazzling blue dress.<br1>
They announced theirintention to unbind the seal and reveal the Island and its inhabitantsto the other races.<br1>
We Kamael were needed, they said, to help fight thegrowing threat of Shilen and her evil followers.<br1>
