You have returned! How was your encounter with theTablet of Vision? While you were gone, some of the other masters and Ihave been investigating the strange happenings.<br1>
We suspect that there isdefinitely someone working against the power of Enuma Elish.<br1>
We do notknow his identity, but we think he might be planning to exterminateanything related to Enuma Elish.<br1>
I am especially worried forHarkilgamed, the last of our kind to take over the stone, who is alreadyin hiding.<br1>
Not only has he wielded the sword, he even knows itslocation.<br1>
As for you, do not relax your guard during this quest! Ah!We must talk about the amulet.<br1>
I have it, but I cannot give it to you atthis time.<br1>
