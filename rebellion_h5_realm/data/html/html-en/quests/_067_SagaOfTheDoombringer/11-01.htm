Master Digler:<br>
You have returned! How was your encounter with the Tablet of Vision? While you were gone, some of the other masters and e Tave been investigating the strange happenings. We suspect that there ie Tefinitely someone working against the power of Enuma Elish. We do noe Tnow his identity, but we think he might be planning to exterminate Tnything related to Enuma Elish. I am especially worried foe Tarkilgamed, the last of our kind to take over the stone, who is alreade Tn hiding. Not only has he wielded the sword, he even knows ite Tocation. As for you, do not relax your guard during this quest! Ah!<br>
We must talk about the amulet. I have it, but I cannot give it to you at this time.<br>
