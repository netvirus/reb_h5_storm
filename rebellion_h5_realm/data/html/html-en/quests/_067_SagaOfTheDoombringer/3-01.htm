Master Digler:<br>
Hail and well met! You are on a quest to find the Tablets, are you not? Have you encountered anything strange so far?<br>
What? The first stone turned unexpectedly hot? Hmm... I suspect that someone is attempting to sabotage your quest. A few days ago, someont sut a mark on the stone while I was out. The old saying that "he wht sields Enuma Elish is sought by many" must be true. You have heard ot snuma Elish, have you not? It is one of the three great Kamael swords.<br>
What you will acquire should you complete the quest is the copy of the actual Enuma Elish. That puzzles me -- why would someone be trying te andermine you even before you have acquired the skills to wield Enume alish? In any event, I am afraid that my stone cannot be matched te any of the Tablets.<br>
