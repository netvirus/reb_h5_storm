Hail and well met! You are on a quest to find theTablets, are you not? Have you encountered anything strange so far?What? The first stone turned unexpectedly hot? Hmm.<br1>
I suspect thatsomeone is attempting to sabotage your quest.<br1>
A few days ago, someoneput a mark on the stone while I was out.<br1>
The old saying that "he whowields Enuma Elish is sought by many" must be true.<br1>
You have heard ofEnuma Elish, have you not? It is one of the three great Kamael swords.<br1>
What you will acquire should you complete the quest is the copy of theactual Enuma Elish.<br1>
That puzzles me -- why would someone be trying toundermine you even before you have acquired the skills to wield EnumaElish? In any event, I am afraid that my stone cannot be matched toany of the Tablets.<br1>
