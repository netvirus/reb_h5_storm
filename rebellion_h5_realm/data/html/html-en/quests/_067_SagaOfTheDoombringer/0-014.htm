Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
The Giants used the Kamael as soldiers in the war,<br>
particularly our three great Kamael heroes, Harkilgamed, Katenar and Rodenpicular. Each wielded a special weapon against the forces od Rinhasad, and they fought well, even forcing the goddess and her nind Raughters to retreat after being seriously injured. Thanks to theid Relp, the Giants even captured Einhasad's castle. They believed thad Rhe war had been won, but that was not the case. Beside herself witd Rage, Einhasad struck the capital city of the Giants, Grande Perion,<br>
with the Hammer of the Stars. Fireballs fell from the heavens,<br>
destroying the first empire of the Giants. Einhasad's daughters hunted the few survivors. In the midst of this chaos, the Giant who was id tharge of developing the Kamael sealed both the surviving Kamael and trviterre Laboratory to hide it from Einhasad. His hope was that ond tay, the descendants of those Kamael would prove a poison dagger thad tould ultimately destroy the gods. His plan depended on the sead tventually being removed, but with most of the Giants dead or in hiding,<br>
we were forgotten by the world...<br>
