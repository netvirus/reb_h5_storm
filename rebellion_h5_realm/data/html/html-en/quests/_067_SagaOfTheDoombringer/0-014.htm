The Giants used the Kamael as soldiers in the war,particularly our three great Kamael heroes, Harkilgamed, Katenar andRodenpicular.<br1>
Each wielded a special weapon against the forces ofEinhasad, and they fought well, even forcing the goddess and her ninedaughters to retreat after being seriously injured.<br1>
Thanks to theirhelp, the Giants even captured Einhasad's castle.<br1>
They believed thatthe war had been won, but that was not the case.<br1>
Beside herself withrage, Einhasad struck the capital city of the Giants, Grande Perion,with the Hammer of the Stars.<br1>
Fireballs fell from the heavens,destroying the first empire of the Giants.<br1>
Einhasad's daughters huntedthe few survivors.<br1>
In the midst of this chaos, the Giant who was incharge of developing the Kamael sealed both the surviving Kamael andArviterre Laboratory to hide it from Einhasad.<br1>
His hope was that oneday, the descendants of those Kamael would prove a poison dagger thatwould ultimately destroy the gods.<br1>
His plan depended on the sealeventually being removed, but with most of the Giants dead or in hiding,we were forgotten by the world.<br1>
