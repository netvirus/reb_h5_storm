That is indeed the substance of the "ForgottenHistory.<br1>
" We were living weapons, beings created by the Giants to battlethe gods themselves.<br1>
Released from the restraints of the gods, theKamael could not be ruled by them.<br1>
But remember, our history is justthat: history.<br1>
The Giants are long vanished, and we must now chart ourown path through this chaotic era.<br1>
In the near future, you will beforced to choose whether to wield Enuma Elish against the gods, or ifthere is another purpose for the sword.<br1>
I have faith that you willchoose wisely, Doombringer.<br1>
