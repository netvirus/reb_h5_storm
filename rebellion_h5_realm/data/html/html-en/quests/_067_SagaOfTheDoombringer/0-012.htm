Well then, I will relate the basics.<br1>
Long, longago, the gods entrusted the rulership of this world to the Giants, whogrew in strength and knowledge.<br1>
Then the gods became embroiled in avicious civil war, which spread to this world and caused a great deal ofdestruction.<br1>
As a result, the Giantts lost their faith in the gods;they began to regard them as flawed, selfish and childish beings who didnot deserve the immense powers they wielded.<br1>
To prevent a recurrence ofwhat had happened during the war, the Giants began to systematicallybuild their power, using their science to research the secrets of thegods' power, magic and lifeforce.<br1>
A massive research facility,Arviterre Laboratory, was even built as part of these efforts.<br1>
