<font color="36DC25">!Hierarch Kekropus:</font><br>
I do not have the time to tell you everything now,but this at least you should know: We Kamael were not sealed on the Isleof Souls because of our combat prowess, as is generally believed, butrather to disguise our true identity and origin.<br1>
A man in black armorand a woman in a blue dress -- I cannot say more about their identitiesthan that -- ultimately released the seal to allow us back into theworld in order to help oppose the growing power of Shilen and herfollowers.<br1>
But though we may now venture onto the surface of the wideworld, our true potential is still limited.<br1>
Still, the woman promised torelease those limitations when someone with the proper qualificationsappeared.<br1>
I believe that you may meet those qualifications: theability to wield Enuma Elish, the sword that can divide heaven andearth.<br1>
