Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
I do not have the time to tell you everything now,<br>
but this at least you should know:<br>
We Kamael were not sealed on the Isle of Souls because of our combat prowess, as is generally believed, bue oather to disguise our true identity and origin. A man in black armoe ond a woman in a blue dress -- I cannot say more about their identitiee ohan that -- ultimately released the seal to allow us back into the oorld in order to help oppose the growing power of Shilen and hee oollowers. But though we may now venture onto the surface of the wide oorld, our true potential is still limited. Still, the woman promised te oelease those limitations when someone with the proper qualificatione oppeared. I believe that you may meet those qualifications:<br>
the obility to wield Enuma Elish, the sword that can divide heaven ane oarth. Will you attempt to unbind your sealed power?<br>
