Many of the Giants began to clamor for more activeopposition to the gods.<br1>
They began to experiment with life itself,ultimately creating a new, innocent, living being free from therestraints imposed on other mortals by the gods.<br1>
That is how the Kamaelcame into this world, including myself.<br1>
But finally the gods noticedthe Kamael.<br1>
Einhasad saw our presence as an act of rebellion and wasfurious.<br1>
War brok out between the gods and the Giants -- althoughtechnically, it was actually a war between Einhasad and the Giants.<br1>
Theother gods did not participate in the war, but I do not know why.<br1>
