You've done well, my friend.<br1>
You have brought me 100 batfangs.<br1>
Magnificent! I can send these to *Hardin's Academy* by thisweek's wagon.<br1>
As promised, I will reward you for your hard work.<br1>
Thisshould be enough, no? Our guild's rule is to give appropriate rewards tothose who have worked for us.<br1>
Actually, I had a cup of tea with Hardinfew days ago.<br1>
Contrary to the rumors, he was a well-mannered, pleasantperson.<br1>
Having a business relationship with such a person is actuallyinvesting in the future.<br1>
We never know when we'll be put into a tightspot, just like when we were attacked by Orcs before .<br1>
