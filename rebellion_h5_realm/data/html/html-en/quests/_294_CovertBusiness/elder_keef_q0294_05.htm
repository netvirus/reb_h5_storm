You've done well, my friend.<br1>
You have brought me 100 batfangs.<br1>
Magnificent! I can send these to *Hardin's Academy* by thisweek's wagon.<br1>
I will give you this ring for your work on behalf of theBronze Key Guild.<br1>
This token signifies that our Guild trusts you.<br1>
Actually, I had a cup of tea with Hardin few days ago.<br1>
Contrary to therumors, he was a well-mannered, pleasant person.<br1>
Having a businessrelationship with such a person is actually investing in the future.<br1>
Wenever know when we'll be put into a tight spot, just like when we wereattacked by Orcs before .<br1>
