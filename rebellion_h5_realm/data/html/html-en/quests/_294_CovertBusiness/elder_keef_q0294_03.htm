Your job is to collect bat fangs.<br1>
While wandering the SpineMine Field, you will often see *blade bats* and *barbed bats*.<br1>
You willhunt them and bring me their *fangs*.<br1>
You need to collect exactly *100*fangs.<br1>
I don't know what such an odd material is used for, but all weneed to do is find the items that our clients want.<br1>
Our guild membersshould be able to bring anything, even dragon scales, to our clients.<br1>
That's our belief.<br1>
There's one thing I don't really like about thisquest .<br1>
the client is *Hardin*, who has been branded as a blackmagician by the Humans.<br1>
Things could become complicated if anyone findsout that our Guild is dealing with such a notorious person .<br1>
I hopeyou won't talk to anyone else about this.<br1>
