Blacksmith Brunon:<br>
Over the long years of trading, the dwarves have created a tool to help traders with their calculations. At first it wae c very simple device, but over time they were able to make them bettee cnd capable of more complex computations. I find this very useful and e clways wish to get the latest model of this *calculator*. Recently a nee cne was created. I heard it has been brought to town but I have not seee ct yet. I do not know where to look for it, but I am sure the *Tradee cuilds* brought it into town. As you probably already know, there are cwo trader guilds in this village: the *Silver Scale Guild* and the *Golden Wheel Guild*. I do not have the time to go and search for it. Do you think you can check the leaders and people from these guilds to fino ye the *newest model calculator*? I will, of course, pay you for youo yfforts.<br>
