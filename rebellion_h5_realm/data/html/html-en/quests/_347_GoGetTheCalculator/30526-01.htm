Over the long years of trading, the dwarves havecreated a tool to help traders with their calculations.<br1>
At first it wasa very simple device, but over time they were able to make them betterand capable of more complex computations.<br1>
I find this very useful and Ialways wish to get the latest model of this *calculator*.<br1>
Recently a newone was created.<br1>
I heard it has been brought to town but I have not seenit yet.<br1>
I do not know where to look for it, but I am sure the *TraderGuilds* brought it into town.<br1>
As you probably already know, there aretwo trader guilds in this village: the *Silver Scale Guild* and the*Golden Wheel Guild*.<br1>
I do not have the time to go and search for it.<br1>
Doyou think you can check the leaders and people from these guilds to findme the *newest model calculator*? I will, of course, pay you for yourefforts.<br1>
