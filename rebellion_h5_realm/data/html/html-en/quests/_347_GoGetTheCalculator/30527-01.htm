Ha! The Calculator? Why are you bothering me forit? Certainly you can find another Dwarf to get one from! Okay.<br1>
You win.<br1>
Actually, I'm tired of carrying it around.<br1>
I hoped to exchange it forsomething more useful or pretty, but in this village, nobody hasanything interesting.<br1>
Sigh! Bring me something pretty and I'll give youthe calculator! I want some new crystals, and I know just where you canfind some! Not far from here the *gemstone beasts* hoard their crystals.<br1>
They shine so brightly it shouldn't be hard to find them.<br1>
Oh, I can'twait! Bring me 10 crystals from the *gemstone beasts* and I'll give youthe calculator.<br1>
