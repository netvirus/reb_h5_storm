<font color="FF8000">Gatekeeper Ziggurat:</font><br>
By borrowing the power of Einhasad, Shunaiman,Emperor of the Elmoreden Empire has sealed the power of ancient magic inthis place.<br1>
In order to guard the entrance to this place, the emperorplaced a human soul into a sphere and made it into a gatekeeper.<br1>
I don'tremember why he needed a human soul to act as his gatekeeper.<br1>
Perhapsthat was to subjugate it, and make it obey the Master of the Seals.<br1>
However, the power of ancient magic, dormant until now, has started toawaken.<br1>
My magic power is too weak to restrain them.<br1>
Therefore, thereis something I would like to ask you.<br1>
