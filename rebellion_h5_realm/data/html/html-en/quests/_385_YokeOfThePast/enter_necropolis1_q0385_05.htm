Good choice! Now go to the dungeon, slay *theguardians of ancient cult* and bring back the *scrolls of ancientmagic*.<br1>
When you bring me the scroll, I will remove the magic power itcontains and turn the scroll into a *Blank Scroll*.<br1>
A Blank Scroll isthe only reward I can offer you.<br1>
Have you heard of *Merchant of Mammon*who often appears in the castle area? He will be very interested in aBlank Scroll.<br1>
You will find out more when you meet him.<br1>
It won't be easyto find him though.<br1>
