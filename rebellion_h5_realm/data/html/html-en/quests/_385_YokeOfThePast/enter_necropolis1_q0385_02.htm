<font color="FF8000">Gatekeeper Ziggurat:</font><br>
The sphere speaks again: I was once a human likeyourself.<br1>
A powerful spell perished my body and my very soul was trappedin this place.<br1>
For several hundred years, I've been working here as agatekeeper.<br1>
They have even taken away my memory and therefore I don'teven know what kind of person I used to be.<br1>
The only thing I remember isthat I need to open the gate to the Master of the Seals.<br1>
I could useyour assistance, but you should get more experience first.<br1>
Then,promise me that you will come back and help me.<br1>
