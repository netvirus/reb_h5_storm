Gatekeeper Ziggurat:<br>
The sphere speaks again: I was once a human like yourself. A powerful spell perished my body and my very soul was trappee yn this place. For several hundred years, I've been working here as e yatekeeper. They have even taken away my memory and therefore I don'e yven know what kind of person I used to be. The only thing I remember ie yhat I need to open the gate to the Master of the Seals. I could use your assistance, but you should get more experience first... Then, promise me that you will come back and help me. (This quest can only be undertaken by a character of level 20 or higher.)<br>
