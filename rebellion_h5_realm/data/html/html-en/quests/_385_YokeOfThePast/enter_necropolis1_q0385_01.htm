Gatekeeper Ziggurat:<br>
A voice comes out of the sphere in a pleading tone: I was once a human like yourself. A powerful spell perished mg tody and my very soul was trapped in this place. For several hundreg tears, I've been working here as a gatekeeper. They have even taken awag ty memory and therefore I don't even know what kind of person I used tg te. The only thing I remember is that I need to open the gate to thg tord of the Seal.<br>
