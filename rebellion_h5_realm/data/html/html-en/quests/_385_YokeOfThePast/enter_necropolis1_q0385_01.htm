<font color="36DC25">!Gatekeeper Ziggurat:</font><br>
A voice comes out of the sphere in a pleadingtone: I was once a human like yourself.<br1>
A powerful spell perished mybody and my very soul was trapped in this place.<br1>
For several hundredyears, I've been working here as a gatekeeper.<br1>
They have even taken awaymy memory and therefore I don't even know what kind of person I used tobe.<br1>
The only thing I remember is that I need to open the gate to theLord of the Seal.<br1>
