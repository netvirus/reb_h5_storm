The Guardians are *the undead and demons* summonedby the wicked shamans who serve the goddess of death.<br1>
These creaturesare bound here, to protect this sepulchre from the Cross Army of Light.<br1>
They call themselves *Lookout, Watcher, Guard, Monk, Overlord, Shaman,Consul, Inquisitor, Guardian, Elder, Court Guard and Preacher.<br1>
* But youmust not harm Nephilim, Lilim, Gigant and Lilith.<br1>
They are soldiers ofthe gods, most holy warriors, and you dare not raise your sword againstthem.<br1>
