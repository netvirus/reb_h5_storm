<br> What? Misunderstanding?	<br> What is that old man talking about? That's absurd.<br1>
<br>But he said he would help us, eh? It's certainly not like him	to lend us his precious map.<br1>
<br> I'm still angry at him, but now I have to admit I'm curious	enough about his motives to talk to him again.<br1>
<br> In any case, show me the map! I want to study it to see	exactly where we should search.<br1>
