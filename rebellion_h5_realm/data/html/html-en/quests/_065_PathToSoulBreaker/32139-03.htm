Someone that our Guild cannot identify iswandering around asking for information about the cargo from Gludin.<br1>
Hehas caused no problems yet but his behavior is very strange.<br1>
Track himdown and find out who he is, then bring the cargo here securely andsafely.<br1>
I have heard that an unidentified man recently left the Town ofGludio in the direction of the Town of Dion.<br1>
Visit the Guild in the Townof Dion first.<br1>
