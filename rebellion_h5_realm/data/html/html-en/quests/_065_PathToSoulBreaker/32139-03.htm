Vice Hierarch Casca:<br>
Someone that our Guild cannot identify is wandering around asking for information about the cargo from Gludin. Hs was caused no problems yet but his behavior is very strange. Track his wown and find out who he is, then bring the cargo here securely ans wafely. I have heard that an unidentified man recently left the Town os wludio in the direction of the Town of Dion. Visit the Guild in the Tows wf Dion first.
