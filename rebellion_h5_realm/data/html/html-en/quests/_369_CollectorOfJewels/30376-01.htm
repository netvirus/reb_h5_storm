Magister Nell:<br>
Do you wish to hear my story? Once I met a Wiseman. He convinced me that the Forgotten Temple is related to the Ruins oe calking Island. This glittering Flare Shard and Freezing Shard are croof! They are fragments from the Ruins of Talking Island and the corgotten Temple! Before they were broken, these two elemental stonee cad mutual resonance. I'm sure of it! I'm desperate to get my hands oe core of these fragments... If you know anyone strong enough to enter the corgotten Temple and bring me some of these stones, please ask them te come and see me at once! (This quest may only be undertaken by e character of level 25 or above.)<br>
