Well, if I only needed them for my research, these wouldbe enough.<br1>
But a wiseman taught me all about these gemstones.<br1>
He saidthat he needed them, and asked me to collect the fragments for him.<br1>
Atthat time the trader Katerina of Talking Island was there.<br1>
She is alsocollecting gemstones.<br1>
When she gives the gemstones to the wiseman, Ialso want to give at least the same quantity to him.<br1>
You see, I am amagister.<br1>
I can't be outdone by a trader like Katerina.<br1>
Do youunderstand? Please do this for me.<br1>
Collect more gemstones so that I cangive them to the wiseman.<br1>
