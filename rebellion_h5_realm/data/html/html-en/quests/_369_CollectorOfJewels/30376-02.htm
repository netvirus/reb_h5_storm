Do you wish to hear my story? Sometime ago, I met aWiseman.<br1>
He told me that the Forgotten Temple is related to the Ruins onTalking Island.<br1>
More than anything else, this glittering Flare Shard andFreezing Shard are the proof! They are fragments of elemental stonefound in the Ruins of Talking Island and the Forgotten Temple! Beforethey were broken, these two elemental stones must have had mutualresonance.<br1>
Would you help me? Please go to the temple and bring me moreof these gemstones.<br1>
