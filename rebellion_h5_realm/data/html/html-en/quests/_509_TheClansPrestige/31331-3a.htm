Too bad! I need you to slaughter *Plague Golem*and bring me his Nucleus! *As I told you before, you don't have to killhim yourself!* There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get hishands bloody! Just stand in a safe place an watch your Clan kill PlagueGolem and then bring his Nucleus to me.<br1>
