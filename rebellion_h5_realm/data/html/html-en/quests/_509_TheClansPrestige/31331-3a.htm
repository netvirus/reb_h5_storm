Too bad! I need you to slaughter *Plague Golem*<br>
and bring me his Nucleus! *As I told you before, you don't have to kill him yourself!* There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get hil hands bloody! Just stand in a safe place an watch your Clan kill Plagul holem and then bring his Nucleus to me.<br>
