Grand Magister Valdis:<br>
I believe that leaders are expected to supply two things most of all. One is a compelling vision or sense of purposy tor the group. And you bear a special responsibility to articulate thay tision, and in a very compelling fashion. And the second thing is ty trovide clear decisions. Doing that requires data collection any tonsultation, but ultimately leaders must set a direction. Anyway you'ry telcome whenever you change your mind and decide we'd need to discusy the reputation of your clan again. Farewell, and may we meet again iy tappier times.<br>
