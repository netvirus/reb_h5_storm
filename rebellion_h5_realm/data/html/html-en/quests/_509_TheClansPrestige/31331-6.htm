I believe that leaders are expected to supplytwo things most of all.<br1>
One is a compelling vision or sense of purposefor the group.<br1>
And you bear a special responsibility to articulate thatvision, and in a very compelling fashion.<br1>
And the second thing is toprovide clear decisions.<br1>
Doing that requires data collection andconsultation, but ultimately leaders must set a direction.<br1>
Anyway you'rewelcome whenever you change your mind and decide we'd need to discussthe reputation of your clan again.<br1>
Farewell, and may we meet again inhappier times.<br1>
