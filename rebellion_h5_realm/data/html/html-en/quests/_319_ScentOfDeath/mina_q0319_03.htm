Do you know about the flower called *nightshade*? Itis a very beautiful plant with a sweet scent that only blossoms atnight.<br1>
The juice is very poisonous, but if it is processed properly itcan be used in making reagents that have many uses.<br1>
Recently, I havebegun raising nightshade in my herb garden.<br1>
However, I am still learningthe craft, so everything is very crude compared to Tetrarch Vellior'sherb garden.<br1>
To make nightshade fertilizer I must collect all sorts ofodd ingredients, and it requires a lot of time and effort.<br1>
I needsomeone to collect ingredients for me.<br1>
