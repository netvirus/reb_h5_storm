I grow many medicinal herbs as a side job.<br1>
Of course,my efforts don't compare at all to Tetrarch Vellior's herb garden, but Iam raising a few priceless herbs like nightshade and belladonna.<br1>
However, as precious as they are, they must be given a specialfertilizer.<br1>
To make the fertilizer of the nightshade, one must collectall sorts of different materials, and it takes a lot of time and effort.<br1>
It would be nice if you could help me later on.<br1>
