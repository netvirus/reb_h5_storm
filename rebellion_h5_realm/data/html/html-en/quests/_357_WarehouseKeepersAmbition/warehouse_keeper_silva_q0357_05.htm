You may have some trouble with the *forest runners, the flineelders, the liele elders and the valley Treant elders*.<br1>
Are you takingnotes? Ah, one more thing.<br1>
Enchanted Valley is too dangerous a place towalk around by yourself.<br1>
So, *bring me a few of your friends who cankeep a secret.<br1>
