<font color="36DC25">!Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by brightlights.<br1>
While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start toacquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousandsreading scriptures in the background.<br1>
You now realize the truth of theworld and yet understand nothing.<br1>
There is a vision of a beautifulblonde woman and a knight with black armor.<br1>
The vision disappears.<br1>
Slowly, you begin to visualize where the next Stone of Commune is.<br1>
Avision appears.<br1>
The sixth Tablet of Vision hidden in the wilds.<br1>
Standing in front of the sixth tablet is the unfamiliar shadow of ahuman without legs.<br1>
and the Stone of Commune, held in his hands, emitsa dim light.<br1>
In an instant, the images disappear and then the stonegoes completely dark.<br1>
