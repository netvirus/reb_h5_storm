The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by bright lights. While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start tt lcquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousandt leading scriptures in the background. You now realize the truth of tht lorld and yet understand nothing. There is a vision of a beautifut llonde woman and a knight with black armor. The vision disappears.<br>
Slowly, you begin to visualize where the next Stone of Commune is...A vision appears...The sixth Tablet of Vision hidden in the wilds.<br>
Standing in front of the sixth tablet is the unfamiliar shadow of a human without legs...and the Stone of Commune, held in his hands, emita h dim light. In an instant, the images disappear and then the stona hoes completely dark.
