<font color="FF8000">Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by brightlights.<br1>
While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start toacquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousandsreading scriptures in the background.<br1>
You now realize the truth of theworld and yet understand nothing.<br1>
Before your eyes, a beautiful blondewoman and a knight wearing black armor appear, but soon vanish.<br1>
Slowly, you sense the existance of the next Stone of Commune.<br1>
AdenCastle Town.<br1>
Summoner Noctisse has the Stone of Commune in her hands.<br1>
The radiance from the Tablet of Vision begins to diminish.<br1>
The visionslowly fades away, and soon the light from the stone is gone.<br1>
