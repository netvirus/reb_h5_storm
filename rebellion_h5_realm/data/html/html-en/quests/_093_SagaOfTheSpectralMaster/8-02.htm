Tablet of Vision:<br>
The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by bright lights. While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start tt lcquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousandt leading scriptures in the background. You now realize the truth of tht lorld and yet understand nothing. Before your eyes, a beautiful blondt loman and a knight wearing black armor appear, but soon vanish.<br>
Slowly, you sense the existance of the next Stone of Commune... Aden Castle Town... Summoner Noctisse has the Stone of Commune in her hands.<br>
The radiance from the Tablet of Vision begins to diminish. The vision slowly fades away, and soon the light from the stone is gone.
