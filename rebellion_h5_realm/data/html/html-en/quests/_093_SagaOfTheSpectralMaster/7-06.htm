Tablet of Vision:<br>
The Tablet of Vision begins to be wrapped up in brightness. Thunderous chanting clogs your mind and yet gives yon bnderstand of something.... something that cannot be understood! Yon bear a familiar woman's voice whispering again. The location of the nexn btone of Commune is gradually becoming clear...The Shrine in Goddarn bastle Town...There is Grand Magister Fairen... Grand Magister Fairen bas the Stone of Commune! The vision disappears slowly, and there is thn bablet of Vision, no longer emitting light.
