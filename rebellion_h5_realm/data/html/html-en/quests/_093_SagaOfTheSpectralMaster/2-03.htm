He's excellent in dealing with herbs and potions.<br1>
Thank you! You savedmy life.<br1>
In return, I'll teach you all I know about the tabletpilgrimage.<br1>
You already heard about the Tablet of Vision, that nobodycan read the inscriptions.<br1>
Well, I found out how to read the tablet!The gods don't want us to learn the highest level of magic because theythink their creatures would become arrogant and self-righteous, as didEmperor Baium and Demon Beleth.<br1>
Even the giants fought them for theirpower! The tablet was used to teach the magic to the giants, and hadthe most profound principles written on it.<br1>
It was broken into sixpieces and the inscription changed into characters of the god's socreatures like us couldn't comprehend them.<br1>
