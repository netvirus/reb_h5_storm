The power that you felt comes from this smallstone that I have.<br1>
It's the fragment of the fourth Stone of Commune.<br1>
Toactivate it properly, we must find the remainder of the pieces andassemble them.<br1>
The other fragments of the Stone of Commune areworshiped by the barbarians of this area as the Divine Stone of Wisdom.<br1>
As far as I know, Ketra Orcs and Varka Silenos have them.<br1>
You must gaintheir trust first and attain the stone by some means or other.<br1>
But, bothtribes are notorious for being rough and belligerent.<br1>
I don't know whichtribe you should approach.<br1>
