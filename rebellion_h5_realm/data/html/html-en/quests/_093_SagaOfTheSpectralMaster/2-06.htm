The answer is in this stone! It's called the Stoneof Commune.<br1>
If you use the power contained in it, you can understand thegod's characters written on the Tablet of Vision.<br1>
Also, hold the stoneand you'll intuitively sense where the tablet is hidden.<br1>
Aren't youcurious who made this? I don't know yet, but one thing is clear -someone is helping the Dark Elves use the knowledge forbidden by thegods! We can't let this opportunity pass to explore the true power ofmagic! Take this stone.<br1>
I don't need it anymore.<br1>
Follow the directionsgiven by the stone and you'll find the first Tablet of Vision.<br1>
