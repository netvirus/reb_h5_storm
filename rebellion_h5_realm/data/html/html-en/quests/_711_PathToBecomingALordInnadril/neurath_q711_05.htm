Some freight belonging to Iason Heine's family was stolen by the Tasaba Lizardmen. The Heine family is recruitins sdventurers to recover the freight, and I think you might gain reas sdvantage by offering your assistance. Obviously you should nos sersonally volunteer, but I think it would be wise to send someone yos san trust, someone well-equipped to succeed in a mission of this kind.<br>
