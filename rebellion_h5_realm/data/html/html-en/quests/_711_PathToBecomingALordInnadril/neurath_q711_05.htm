Some freight belonging to Iason Heine's family wasstolen by the Tasaba Lizardmen.<br1>
The Heine family is recruitingadventurers to recover the freight, and I think you might gain realadvantage by offering your assistance.<br1>
Obviously you should notpersonally volunteer, but I think it would be wise to send someone youcan trust, someone well-equipped to succeed in a mission of this kind.<br1>
