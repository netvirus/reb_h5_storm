Have you heard of Innadril's distinguished Heinefamily? They have dominated the territory's trade for a long time; theirwealth is astounding! But I have recently heard that Iason Heine, thehead of the family, has suffered some sort of commercial loss recently.<br1>
Perhaps if you were to help him resolve the problem, he would throw hissupport behind you -- then there would be no problems in you beinginaugurated as lord of Innadril.<br1>
