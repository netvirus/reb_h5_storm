Did Guard Cadmon send you?<br1>
All right. I guess you are good enough. Bear in mind that the Varka Silenos are different from other Silenos.<br1>
They may look alike, but the Varka Silenos have traditionally been fearless soldiers.<br1>
They are completely different from other Silenos who are engaged in stock farming.<br1>
They are very particular about manners.<br1>
You should try not to offend them. Okay, here's the task.<br1>
