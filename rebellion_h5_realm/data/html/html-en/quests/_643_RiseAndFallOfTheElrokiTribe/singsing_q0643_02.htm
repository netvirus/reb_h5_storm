On this Primeval Isle you'll find primitive creatures calleddinosaurs -- you'll never see anything like them in Aden, believe me!According to wise wizads, even the gods and Giants were afraid of thedinosaurs.<br1>
They cannot be found in Aden -- thankfully -- but are stillplentiful on that strange island.<br1>
Around the wharf, you'll find onlyrelatively weak ones, but they are still a challenge for even thehardiest adventurer.<br1>
The wizard Karakawei has been pestering me toacquire some of those creatures' bone for study.<br1>
If you defeat them andbring back their bones, I will purchase them from you on his behalf.<br1>
