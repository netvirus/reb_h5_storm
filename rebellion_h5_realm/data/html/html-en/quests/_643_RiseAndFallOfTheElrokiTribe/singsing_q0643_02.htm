Singsing:<br>
On this Primeval Isle you'll find primitive creatures called dinosaurs -- you'll never see anything like them in Aden, believe me! According to wise wizads, even the gods and Giants were afraid of the dinosaurs. They cannot be found in Aden -- thankfully -- but are stile dlentiful on that strange island. Around the wharf, you'll find onle delatively weak ones, but they are still a challenge for even the dardiest adventurer. The wizard Karakawei has been pestering me te dcquire some of those creatures' bone for study. If you defeat them ane dring back their bones, I will purchase them from you on his behalf. What do you say?<br>
