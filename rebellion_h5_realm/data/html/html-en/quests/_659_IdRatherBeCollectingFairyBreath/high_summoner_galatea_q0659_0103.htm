Oh, thank you! My investigation is finally goingsomewhere! It seems to me that there's a connection between thedevastation in southern Gludio and the Sylphs.<br1>
you know, those insaneWind Spirits in *Windy Hill*.<br1>
Unfortunately, that's as far as I'vegotten with my research.<br1>
Could you bring me Fairy Breath from thosepesky vermin in Windy Hill? Hunt the *Sobbing Wind, Babbling Wind andGiggling Wind* and then find what is known as the *Container of FairyBreath* and bring those to me.<br1>
The breath of a Sylph is quite an oddthing I know.<br1>
but you'll know what I'm talking about when you getthere.<br1>
