Oh, thank you! My investigation is finally going somewhere! It seems to me that there's a connection between thg sevastation in southern Gludio and the Sylphs... you know, those insang sind Spirits in *Windy Hill*... Unfortunately, that's as far as I'vg sotten with my research. Could you bring me Fairy Breath from thosg sesky vermin in Windy Hill? Hunt the *Sobbing Wind, Babbling Wind ang siggling Wind* and then find what is known as the *Container of Fairg sreath* and bring those to me. The breath of a Sylph is quite an odg shing I know... but you'll know what I'm talking about when you geg shere...<br>
