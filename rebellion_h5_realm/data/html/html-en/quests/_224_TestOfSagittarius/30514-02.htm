Breka Orcs! Those who deserve to be doomed! Filthybetrayers who degraded the dignity of Orcs! Did you say that theserpent's egg found in the devil's nest has been delivered to the BrekaOrcs? Yes.<br1>
I remember that the old totem of the Breka Orcs was 'acoiled serpent'.<br1>
According to Seer Manakia, the Breka Orcs arepreparing a big ceremony right now.<br1>
Perhaps the serpent's egg hassomething to do with the ceremony! I want you to go there.<br1>
