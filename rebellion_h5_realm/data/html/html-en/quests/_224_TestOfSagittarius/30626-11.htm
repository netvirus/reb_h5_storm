Sagittarius Hamil Brankel was alive! Although I did meet him, he leftfor the south of Oren saying that he will buy some time while *CommanderKadesh* recovers himself by eating the lizardmen.<br1>
Shit!.<br1>
I should havefollowed him! That is.<br1>
The Crescent Arrow! It is the first time I haveseen it since 20 years ago! Hey, take that and follow Brankel.<br1>
If youkill the *leto liardmen* which Kadesh feeds on, he will eventually turnup.<br1>
That is when you should kill him with that arrow.<br1>
