Here,this is *the Crescent Bow*.<br1>
The only way that thisbow differs from other bows is that there is magic inside it to killCommander Kadesh.<br1>
Keep in mind that you can only shoot a *wooden arrow*with this bow.<br1>
Please kill the Commander with the Crescent Bow.<br1>
At themoment he is not so strong but as time goes by he will cause more andmore damage.<br1>
First of all you must go to *Hamil*and find out whereCommander Kadesh is located.<br1>
Go ahead, now.<br1>
The Ivory Tower wishes youvictory.<br1>
