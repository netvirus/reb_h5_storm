Sagittariuses are those who are called as thebest bowmans of this kingdom.<br1>
100 years ago, when the gold dragonWindbior attacked Castle Aden, a bowman by the name of Atlanta, shot anarrow right through the dragon's eye and was given his first title as aSagittarius.<br1>
At the moment there are just 33 Sagittariuses altogether.<br1>
If you want to be recognized as the best bowman, you may take the*Testof the Sagittarius* and prove your abilities.<br1>
Many hunters and bowmantook the test this year as well, but they all failed.<br1>
You must be betterthan good to pass the test.<br1>
I heard that you had good skills but as Isee it in the eyes of a Union President.<br1>
You are still not goodenough.<br1>
Train a little more before you come back.<br1>
