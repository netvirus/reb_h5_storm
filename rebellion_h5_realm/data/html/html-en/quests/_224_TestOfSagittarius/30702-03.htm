Sagittariuses are those who are called as thebest bowmans of this kingdom.<br1>
100 years ago, when the gold dragonWindbior attacked Castle Aden, a bowman by the name of Atlanta, shot anarrow right through the dragon's eye and was given his first title as aSagittarius.<br1>
At the moment there are just 33 Sagittariuses altogether.<br1>
If you want to be recognized as the best bowman, you may take the*Testof the Sagittarius* and prove your abilities.<br1>
Many hunters and bowmantook the test this year as well, but they all failed.<br1>
I warn you, ifyour skills are not good enough to shoot down a flying eagle, you'dbetter not give it a try, in the first place.<br1>
