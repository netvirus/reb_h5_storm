It said in the letter as follows: I am leaving forthe Ant's Nest now.<br1>
However, I might not be able to come back.<br1>
But Iwill leave my traces for the next investigators.<br1>
I wish I could go andsee Brankel right away, but it's more important for me to take care ofthe lizardmen who are threatening the village.<br1>
Damn it.<br1>
So, I needyou to go to the Ant's Nest in the Wastelands and investigate the area.<br1>
It would be best if you could find Brankel himself, but in case youcan't, at least try to look for the traces he said he would leave in hisletter.<br1>
The wastelands guardian *Aaron Tanford* will be waiting for youin the *southern entrance of the Wastelands*.<br1>
