What? The Stone of Commune? Uh.<br1>
As a matterof fact, yes, I have it! But I can't give it to you! Let me explain.<br1>
For as long as I can remember, I've had but one dream! It was the sameevery night, but forgotten soon after waking.<br1>
But recently, I rememberedit! I dream of being able to communicate with all other intelligentbeings! I suppose I'm getting ahead of myself.<br1>
Basically, I just wanteveryone to understand each other.<br1>
And the animals! I've always lovedanimals and want people to be able to talk with them! I believe thatthis Stone of Commune will lead me there.<br1>
But, if you really need it,I'll give it to you.<br1>
Just trade me something of equal value for it.<br1>
