Oh, you brought the ice crystal and the fish! Great!Then, I'll make Bitter Cold Beer.<br1>
According to legend, the originalBitter Cold Beer had a slightly fishy aroma.<br1>
To get that, you need toroast this fish and capture the smell of it in the ice.<br1>
In otherwords, cut up the fish and roast only its fins and bones.<br1>
Chop theice crystal into small pieces.<br1>
A regular knife freezes the moment ittouches the ice crystal.<br1>
I use a special knife.<br1>
This knife was made bythe top maestro of the Black Anvil guild.<br1>
