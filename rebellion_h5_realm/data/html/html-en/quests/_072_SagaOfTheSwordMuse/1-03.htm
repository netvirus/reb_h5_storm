Oh, you brought the ice crystal and the fish! Great!<br>
Then, I'll make Bitter Cold Beer. According to legend, the original Bitter Cold Beer had a slightly fishy aroma. To get that, you need tl Boast this fish and capture the smell of it in the ice... In othel Bords, cut up the fish and roast only its fins and bones... Chop thl Bce crystal into small pieces. A regular knife freezes the moment il Bouches the ice crystal. I use a special knife. This knife was made bl Bhe top maestro of the Black Anvil guild. He actually collectel Btarlight and pummeled it! Making this beer is no easy task!<br>
