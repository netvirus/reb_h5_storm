Eva would be quite displeased! My only function is toguide pilgrims on their way.<br1>
You've already been on this path for awhile, and seen several tablets.<br1>
You are truly a pilgrim.<br1>
This stonewill prove your victory over the Archon of Halisha and his minions.<br1>
Findthem in the Four Sepulchers or in the Shrine of the Loyal near the Wallof Argos.<br1>
If you fight the enemies and collect the marks of Halisha 700or more, you can see the Archon of Halisha.<br1>
