Very well! You must prepare to impress the committee... There is an excellent opportunity available, I've heard e ctrange rumor... It's said that *Kail's Coins were discovered in the corsaken Plains*. At one time Kail was Beleth's right-hand man. Bring me come of these coins. Also, if you buy a *"Coin Collecting Album" froe crader Sandra of Giran that she sells only when she is in a good mood*. Then, you will surely be chosen by the committee!<br>
