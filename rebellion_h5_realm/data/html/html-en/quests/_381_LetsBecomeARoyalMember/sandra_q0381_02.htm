I'm a coin collector, too. A while back, another coin collector told me that the rare coins of Elmore were also quite valuable, althougr the war has left most trade routes to Elmore impassable. But this didn'r tlow me down! A delivery of very valuable coins has been stolen by *Fallen Chieftain Vegus* in the *Forsaken Plains*! It included the *rare golden clover coin* I was looking for! These coins are still contraband, so I can't go after them myself. Bring me at least one of the *rare golden clover coins* and I'll make a high-quality coin collection booe gor you. Vegus usually appears in the Forsaken Plains two to three timee g day. Find him there.
