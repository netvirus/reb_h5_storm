I'm a coin collector, too.<br1>
A while back, another coin collectortold me that the rare coins of Elmore were also quite valuable, althoughthe war has left most trade routes to Elmore impassable.<br1>
But this didn'tslow me down! A delivery of very valuable coins has been stolen by*Fallen Chieftain Vegus* in the *Forsaken Plains*! It included the *raregolden clover coin* I was looking for! These coins are still contraband,so I can't go after them myself.<br1>
Bring me at least one of the *raregolden clover coins* and I'll make a high-quality coin collection bookfor you.<br1>
Vegus usually appears in the Forsaken Plains two to three timesa day.<br1>
Find him there.<br1>
