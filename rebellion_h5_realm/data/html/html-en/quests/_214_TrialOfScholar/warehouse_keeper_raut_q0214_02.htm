What? Weren't you here looking for the Scriptureof Knowledge? I have been suffering from bad dreams for the last coupleof nights.<br1>
Every night an old man appears and demands that I give thescripture to the person who brings this envelope.<br1>
First I thought it wasjust a silly dream, but then it keeps recurring night after night!Anyway, I truly apologize.<br1>
Take this *Scripture of Knowledge: Volume I*.<br1>
Regarding the remaining 3 volumes, I do not know.<br1>
My brother said thathe gave them to his friends.<br1>
It was said that some strange man askedthem to steal the scriptures.<br1>
However my brother and his youngcomrades kept it for themselves.<br1>
They ran all the way to this villagewhere I now live.<br1>
Afterwards they split up and took one book each, andhave not been heard from since.<br1>
What do you say, would you like to meet*my brother*? He might remember something.<br1>
By the way, he won't evenspeak to you if you don't bring him any alcohol.<br1>
Here, take this winewith you.<br1>
I hope you can sort it out so that I can sleep in peace.<br1>
