Well, yes, of course.<br1>
There are 6.<br1>
To tell you the truth,I know who has the other 2, and I am not inclined to get them back.<br1>
AsDieter told you, the books are meaningless unless you have all 6.<br1>
Thisknowledge could be very dangerous if it became widespread in the world.<br1>
My book is a mere copy of the key of knowledge which the Gods used toteach the Giants the secrets of *absolute geometry*.<br1>
I just transcribedthis knowledge and have no intention of allowing this awkward copy looseupon the world.<br1>
It must be kept from the grasp of greedy Humans andDwarves at all costs.<br1>
