The Book of Knowledge? Ha! That was sold long ago.<br1>
Triff left it to cover his bar tab, but I didn't think he would pay itback so I sold it.<br1>
It was a Sage who bought it.<br1>
He was a very eagerbuyer and paid handsomely for it.<br1>
If you want the book, talk to him.<br1>
Ihave his name here, I wrote it in the account book.<br1>
Ah! Here it is!.<br1>
It was a month ago.<br1>
Casian is his name.<br1>
*Elder Casian*.<br1>
Address.<br1>
*The Wastelands*.<br1>
I wonder what he is doing in a place like theWastelands.<br1>
Anyway, if you want to try to talk him out of his preciousbook, he is there.<br1>
