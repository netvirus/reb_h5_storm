For your last task you must see *Elder Cronos*.<br1>
He isthe wisest prophet and the greatest scholar of all time.<br1>
He is so oldthat he is mentioned in our history books, although no one actuallyknows how old he is or even his true name.<br1>
It is said that he has beenalive since the age of Elmoreden! He does have his detractors, however,with some going so far as to call him a swindler! However, I met himduring my days of discipline and, in my opinion, he is the true prophet.<br1>
He currently lives in seclusion in *Hunters Village.<br1>
* Occasionally hewill venture out to join us in a trial in the hope of meeting some youngscholars.<br1>
Go and see Elder Cronos and take this mark with you.<br1>
Accomplishing the task that he will give you is the final step of thistrial.<br1>
