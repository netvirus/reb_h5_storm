Not long after I arrived in Giran frighteningmonsters began to gather in the corridor to the north.<br1>
During this timeI learned that the creatures using magic were not originally magicusers.<br1>
I can't be sure, but I sense the complicity of Dark MagicianHardin.<br1>
As you know, his school is nearby.<br1>
I can't imagine why, but I amquite sure that it is he who gave these monsters the ability to usemagic.<br1>
I have no evidence of this crime, and the suspicions seem to bemine alone.<br1>
I intend to investigate, starting with the monsters that usemagic.<br1>
