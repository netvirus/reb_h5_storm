*The Test of the Scholar* is one that all Wizards mustpass.<br1>
Only those who possess a passion for research and humility inlearning will advance to the level of high magic and knowledge.<br1>
I cantell that research is not your strong suit.<br1>
Each person has their ownway.<br1>
Some will be Warriors, and others will search for enlightenmentthrough spirituality.<br1>
I pray that you find your own road and overcomeall the obstacles that you confront along the way.<br1>
