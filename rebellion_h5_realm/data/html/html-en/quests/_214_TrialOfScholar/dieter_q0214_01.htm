Yes, I used to work for Master Cronos.<br1>
Ha, he told youthat, did he? I took that job because I wanted to learn magic.<br1>
He mainlywanted an errand boy, but I was able to learn much from him eventually.<br1>
Master Cronos was a nice man.<br1>
He asked you to find the Book ofIntelligence? I shudder when I remember the last time I heard of thatbook.<br1>
He flew into such a rage I thought he would kill me.<br1>
