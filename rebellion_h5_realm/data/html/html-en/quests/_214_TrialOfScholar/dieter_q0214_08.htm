This vision came to me from the key you gave me.<br1>
"Youwere being watched by the thieves before you even stole the scripture.<br1>
Because it was so long ago I was not able to distinguish much aboutthem.<br1>
There were 4 shadows.<br1>
One of them was definitely a Dwarf, obviousfrom the short shadow.<br1>
The other 3 were more difficult to distinguish.<br1>
It was a moonless night.<br1>
I saw them open the box and steal the scriptureshortly after you left it there.<br1>
They left hurriedly, in a northerlydirection.<br1>
" I don't remember anything after this.<br1>
I think there may bemore secrets locked in my memory.<br1>
