These memories bring me such pain.<br1>
Well, you'll findout soon enough so I might as well tell you.<br1>
I stole the books.<br1>
Mastercrossed the line that day.<br1>
I was enraged when he told me I shouldconsider being a farmer.<br1>
I stole the books that night to spite him.<br1>
Ihid the books in a very safe place.<br1>
I wanted to get Master intotrouble.<br1>
But it got complicated.<br1>
