For your last task you must see *Elder Cronos*.<br1>
He isthe wisest prophet and the greatest scholar of all time.<br1>
He is so oldthat he is mentioned in our history books, although no one actuallyknows how old he is or even what his true name is.<br1>
It is said that hehas been alive since the age of Elmoreden.<br1>
He does have his detractors,however, with some going so far as to call him a swindler! However, Imet him during my days of discipline and, in my opinion, he is the trueprophet.<br1>
He currently lives in seclusion in *Hunters Village.<br1>
*Occasionally he will venture out to join us in a trial in the hope ofmeeting some young scholars.<br1>
Go and see Elder Cronos and take this markwith you.<br1>
Accomplishing the task that he will give you is the final stepof this trial.<br1>
