<font color="36DC25">!Elder Cronos:</font><br>
Absolute geometry evolved from the beginning of time.<br1>
Itcontains all truth in the universe.<br1>
Mathematics, dynamics, architecture,astronomy, and navigation were all derived from the absolute geometry.<br1>
He who truly understands absolute geometry can control the world.<br1>
Thesecrets of absolute geometry are contained on *Maphr's Tablet Fragment*,written in the ancient language of the Giants.<br1>
Word has come that theDwarves have been trying to obtain the tablet.<br1>
I shudder to think ofthe consequences if this knowledge should fall into the hands of thosegreedy creatures! The Scripture of Knowledge contains the secrets ofabsolute geometry written down in understandable language.<br1>
Do you haveany idea how dangerous this knowledge is? You must bring it back.<br1>
Eventhough it was only a part that I transcribed.<br1>
And with only 4 booksthe knowledge should be safe.<br1>
We cannot be too careful.<br1>
