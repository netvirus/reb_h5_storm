Good job! Now, take this mark and I will tell youof the monsters you must slay.<br1>
First are the *Monster Eye Destroyers*.<br1>
Many of these creatures are found in the wasteland or on the Plains ofDion.<br1>
You must bring me 5 Monster Eye Destroyer Skins.<br1>
Next are the*Breka Orc Shamans*.<br1>
They can be easily found in Giran.<br1>
Kill them andbring back 5 of their necklaces.<br1>
Last of all are the *Shackles*.<br1>
I need2 Shackle Scalps.<br1>
They lurk in Dragon Valley and are quite dangerous.<br1>
Lately they have been seen in the Crater of Ivory Tower.<br1>
Your life willbe in danger in either place, so please be careful.<br1>
I'll write you alist to help you remember all of this.<br1>
