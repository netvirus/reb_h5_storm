What in blazes? I understood that there were only 4volumes of the Scripture of Knowledge.<br1>
But now this! It says thatthere is one before the 1st and one after the 4th.<br1>
! How could itbe? Without those two, we won't be able to understand the Scripture!What a blow! To find 4 volumes and then discover that it is notenough.<br1>
Now I will never be able to decipher the texts.<br1>
