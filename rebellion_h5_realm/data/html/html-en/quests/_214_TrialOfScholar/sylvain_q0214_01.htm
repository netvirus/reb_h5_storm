You must learn about the purification of light.<br1>
Asyou probably know, my duty is to purify the land of unclean energy.<br1>
Inthe eastern part of this village is an execution ground where many ofthe people involved in the peasant's uprising were killed.<br1>
This placecasts a dark shadow over all of Dion.<br1>
This evil history has made thearea a fertile ground for strange creatures.<br1>
You must sooth the angryspirits of the execution ground and assist in the purification of thisland.<br1>
This won't be easy or quick.<br1>
It requires patience and persistence.<br1>
