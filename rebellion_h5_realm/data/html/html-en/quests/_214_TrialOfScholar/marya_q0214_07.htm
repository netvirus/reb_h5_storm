It wasn't very much different from any other day.<br1>
I was alone,daydreaming as usual.<br1>
As always, my thoughts eventually returned to thathorrible day.<br1>
Then my childhood friend Lucilla came to visit.<br1>
We wentout together and I had more fun than I have in years.<br1>
We stayed thenight in Gludin.<br1>
The next morning we parted, going to our respectivehomes.<br1>
When I got there my house had been ransacked and the scrollstolen from its locker.<br1>
The only thing undisturbed was Lucilla's Handbagthat she left behind.<br1>
