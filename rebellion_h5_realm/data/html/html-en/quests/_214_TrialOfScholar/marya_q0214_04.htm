I must have the scrolls in order to help you.<br1>
Lucas's mentionof the fortune-teller reminds me of something.<br1>
I know an astrologerwho is an old friend of my family.<br1>
I haven't seen her since thepeasant's uprising.<br1>
Her name is *Creta the Astrologer*.<br1>
You should beable to find her in *Floran Village*.<br1>
Take her this letter.<br1>
I think shemay be able to help us.<br1>
Please.<br1>
