Running errands for Mirien, are you? How are thosegreenhorns? Aren't they annoying when they ask you to do this and that?They call themselves High Priest or Grand Magister or whatever, but onlytheir words are courageous.<br1>
They probably don't even know any greatmagic.<br1>
All of their 'knowledge' has come from books, they have nopractical experience.<br1>
'That's the way of a Sorcerer' doesn't ring sotrue anymore, does it? OK, I'll ask you just one more time.<br1>
