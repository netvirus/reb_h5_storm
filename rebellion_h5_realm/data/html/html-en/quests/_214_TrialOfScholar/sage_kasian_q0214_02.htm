So, you have come for the 4th volume of the Scripture ofKnowledge? I understand your situation but it is not something that Ican give freely.<br1>
Do you have any idea of the power of these volumes?They contain the knowledge of the Giants' technology that was thoughtlost for millenia! The absolute geometry.<br1>
It's a pity that we can'tdecipher the texts since we are missing volumes 1, 2, and 3.<br1>
