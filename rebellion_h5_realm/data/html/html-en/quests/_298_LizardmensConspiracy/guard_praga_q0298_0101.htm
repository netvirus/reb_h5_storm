As you may know, the *Maille lizardman stronghold* is inthe west part of Gludio Castle Town.<br1>
During the war with Grecia, theyinfiltrated our land through a gap in our security, and our guards havebeen unable to drive them out since.<br1>
An interesting report about themhas recently surfaced, and Magister Rohmer is investigating the matter.<br1>
He's hopeful that this new intelligence will allow us to destroy thelizardman forces soon.<br1>
