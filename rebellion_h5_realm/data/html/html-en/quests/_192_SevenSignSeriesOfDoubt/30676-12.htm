<br> Ach! If everyone was as warm-hearted as you, I'd not need	contractors, eh? I'd just ask people wandering by to help, and keep my	coin in my pocket.<br1>
<br> But I'm no leech, y'hear.<br1>
I'll pay your way fair and square,	and I'll nae hear a peep of protest from you.<br1>
I'll make sure it's	waiting for you in the	<font color="LEVEL">Temple of Einhasad</font> by the time you get to	<font color="LEVEL">High Priest Hollint</font>.<br1>
<br> Take this letter, and get going now.<br1>
I've a body to bring	home.<br1>
