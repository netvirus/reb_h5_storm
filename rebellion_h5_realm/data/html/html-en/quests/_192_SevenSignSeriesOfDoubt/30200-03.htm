<br> I was out walking through the	<font color="LEVEL">Oren Castle</font> grounds a couple of nights ago.<br1>
Truth be told, I was clearing my head - women problems, see?	<br> Anyway, there I was, when it a chill creeps up my spine and	everything goes deathly quiet.<br1>
Suddenly this thing appears in front of	me, makes some weird old sound, and.<br1>
I could feel its eyes looking.<br1>
looking INTO me.<br1>
<br> Then, quick as a click, it was gone.<br1>
<br> See.<br1>
told you.<br1>
It was nothing.<br1>
