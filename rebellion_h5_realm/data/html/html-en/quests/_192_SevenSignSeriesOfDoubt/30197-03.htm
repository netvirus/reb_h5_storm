Guard Hector:<br>
Stan? He guards the southern entrance to Oren Castle . Should be sn duty right about now, as luck would have it.<br>
Mind you, he is known for spinning the odd tale. Once he told me he'd seen a giant rat scrambling through the castle kitchens, so wd ment down together, swords at the ready an' torches lit.<br>
Only turned out to be a stray dog didn't it? Cute little thing n all, called it Bessie. Course, then it died. Jumped out e tindow, it did. Stupid mutt.<br>
Anyway, enough of that. You go see Stan.
