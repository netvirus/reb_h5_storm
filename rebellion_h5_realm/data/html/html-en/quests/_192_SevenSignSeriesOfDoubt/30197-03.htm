<br>	<font color="LEVEL">Stan?</font> He guards the	<font color="LEVEL">southern entrance to Oren Castle </font>.<br1>
Should be	on duty right about now, as luck would have it.<br1>
<br> Mind you, he is known for spinning the odd tale.<br1>
Once he told	me he'd seen a giant rat scrambling through the castle kitchens, so we	went down together, swords at the ready an' torches lit.<br1>
<br> Only turned out to be a stray dog didn't it? Cute little	thing n all, called it Bessie.<br1>
Course, then it died.<br1>
Jumped out a	window, it did.<br1>
Stupid mutt.<br1>
<br> Anyway, enough of that.<br1>
You go see Stan.<br1>
