<br> Here about the murderer aren't you?	<br> Can't blame you--I'm sure there's quite some bounty on his	head, but I ain't here to aid the fear mongering that's been going on,	no sir.<br1>
<br> Besides, stay within Oren's walls and you'll be safe as	houses.<br1>
What's outside that pulls so many out, anyway? I swear.<br1>
the	folk in these parts have their heads in the clouds.<br1>
They're all crusade	this, save the world that.<br1>
<br> Now, look at me.<br1>
I'm happy, I'm content.<br1>
Keep people safe,	and sleep sound as a bear in Winter.<br1>
