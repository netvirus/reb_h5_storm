<br> Why? You're not.<br1>
you're not thinking of going there are	you?	<br> But there's nothing there.<br1>
and if there WAS something there	then it's not something you'll want to sit down and share stories with,	trust me.<br1>
<br> Anyway, the	<font color="LEVEL">area East of Oren Castle</font> is fairly	unspectacular.<br1>
Nothing there you'd want to see, and.<br1>
oh.<br1>
I just told	you where to go, didn't I?	<br> Bah.<br1>
