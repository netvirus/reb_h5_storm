<br> Ach.<br1>
Look, I'm not saying you'll find Jacob face down in a	ditch.<br1>
I just want the boy found.<br1>
If he's poured my money down his	throat again then.<br1>
well.<br1>
he'll see.<br1>
<br> I've found out some bits of information too.<br1>
Seems	<font color="LEVEL">Hector</font> knows something about this killer,	though if he's able to pull fact from fiction then he's got more	knocking about that skull of his than most.<br1>
<br> Take this letter, and go and find him at	<font color="LEVEL">Oren's Northern entrance</font>.<br1>
With luck he'll	set your path straight and lead you to m'cousin.<br1>
