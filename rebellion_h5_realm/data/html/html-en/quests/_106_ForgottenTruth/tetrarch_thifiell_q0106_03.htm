Recently, when a portion of the School of Dark Artscollapsed, a hidden room was revealed, and a portion of the ancientscroll called *Kaisha's Revelation* was discovered.<br1>
Have you ever heardof this scroll? Fifty years ago, by the western shores of the Humankingdom Elmore, a number of very old sheepskin scrolls were discovered.<br1>
According to *Honorius*, the Human scholar who discovered them, thescrolls were part of a religious text written in the Early Age of theGiants.<br1>
Surprisingly, the writings of the scroll contained truthspreviously unknown to the world or else tainted by falsehoods, thelegend of Gran Kain and Shillien.<br1>
But unfortunately, Honorius wasimprisoned by the foolish Humans who worship Einhasad before he couldtranslate the scrolls, and the documents he had been translating wereall taken from him.<br1>
A ridiculous religious court hearing was held, andthe judgment was even more unbelievable -- The accused is herebyconvicted of forgery of a heretical text in secret correspondence withthe followers of the dark arts, and his blasphemy is unforgivable.<br1>
Inthe end, this poor scholar was accused of being a pagan and was put todeath by those religious leaders who feared the truth.<br1>
Torched at thestake.<br1>
The Humans say that our Dark Elven brothers are ruthless, but wecan never be a match for the coldhearted cruelty of the Humans.<br1>
