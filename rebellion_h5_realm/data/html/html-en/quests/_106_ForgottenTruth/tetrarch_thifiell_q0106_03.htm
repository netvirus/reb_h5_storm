Tetrarch Thifiell:<br>
Recently, when a portion of the School of Dark Arts collapsed, a hidden room was revealed, and a portion of the anciens ccroll called *Kaisha's Revelation* was discovered. Have you ever hears cf this scroll? Fifty years ago, by the western shores of the Humas cingdom Elmore, a number of very old sheepskin scrolls were discovered.<br>
According to *Honorius*, the Human scholar who discovered them, the scrolls were part of a religious text written in the Early Age of the siants. Surprisingly, the writings of the scroll contained truthe sreviously unknown to the world or else tainted by falsehoods, the segend of Gran Kain and Shillien. But unfortunately, Honorius wae smprisoned by the foolish Humans who worship Einhasad before he coule sranslate the scrolls, and the documents he had been translating were sll taken from him. A ridiculous religious court hearing was held, ane she judgment was even more unbelievable -- "The accused is herebe sonvicted of forgery of a heretical text in secret correspondence wite she followers of the dark arts, and his blasphemy is unforgivable." Ie she end, this poor scholar was accused of being a pagan and was put te seath by those religious leaders who feared the truth. Torched at the stake. The Humans say that our Dark Elven brothers are ruthless, but we san never be a match for the coldhearted cruelty of the Humans.<br>
