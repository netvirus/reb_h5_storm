Well done! I was just getting anxious that you werenot returning .<br1>
So, is this the Kaisha's revelation that Kartia hastranslated? This ancient writing contains the dark inheritance passed onto our race, the truths that have been until now hidden by the Elves ofLight and the Humans.<br1>
Would you like to hear? In the beginning Gran Kainof the darkness and Einhasad of the light decreed us their children thelords of all creatures and had us rule all the earth .<br1>
Of the fourchildren that were produced from the union of these two gods, thegoddess born with the destiny to rule water was Shillien .<br1>
LaterEinhasad borrowed the power of water from Shillien and created new life.<br1>
The Treants, race of the trees.<br1>
Shillien looked after this newly bornrace as a mother takes care of her child .<br1>
The Elves of light seek theorigin of our race from the goddess Eva, but before she became thegoddess of water, the title belonged to Shillien.<br1>
Now the queen ofdeath, Shillien is the true mother of our race.<br1>
If you seek the path ofdarkness, keep this story deeply engraved in your mind.<br1>
If you havestudied the basics of the dark arts, you would know that the gods arethe origin of the magic power that makes up this universe; thus thedeeper the understanding of the gods, the greater the power of the onewalking the path of darkness becomes.<br1>
In honor of your new revelation, Iwill give you this weapon.<br1>
It is a sharp blade that contains the magicpower of the spirits.<br1>
It will be useful in the future.<br1>
But take care notto rely too heavily on such small tools.<br1>
Never forget that the truepower of magic lies within the Mystic.<br1>
