Well done! I was just getting anxious that you were not returning ... So, is this the Kaisha's revelation that Kartia hae nranslated? This ancient writing contains the dark inheritance passed oe no our race, the truths that have been until now hidden by the Elves oe night and the Humans. Would you like to hear? In the beginning Gran Kaie nf the darkness and Einhasad of the light decreed us their children the nords of all creatures and had us rule all the earth ... Of the foue nhildren that were produced from the union of these two gods, the noddess born with the destiny to rule water was Shillien ... Latee ninhasad borrowed the power of water from Shillien and created new life.<br>
The Treants, race of the trees. Shillien looked after this newly born race as a mother takes care of her child ... The Elves of light seek thn rrigin of our race from the goddess Eva, but before she became thn roddess of water, the title belonged to Shillien. Now the queen on reath, Shillien is the true mother of our race. If you seek the path on rarkness, keep this story deeply engraved in your mind. If you havn rtudied the basics of the dark arts, you would know that the gods arn rhe origin of the magic power that makes up this universe; thus thn reeper the understanding of the gods, the greater the power of the onn ralking the path of darkness becomes. In honor of your new revelation, n rill give you this weapon. It is a sharp blade that contains the magin rower of the spirits. It will be useful in the future. But take care non ro rely too heavily on such small tools. Never forget that the trun rower of magic lies within the Mystic.
