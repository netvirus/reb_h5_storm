Go and seek *Abyssal Celebrant Kartia* in the*Temple of Shillien*.<br1>
This black onyx necklace was promised to Kartia inreturn for the translation, so go deliver it to him, and return to mewith the translated Revelations.<br1>
Take care that no one hears aboutKaisha's revelations.<br1>
There are many dangerous characters who would stopat nothing to get their hands on that ancient scroll.<br1>
For your safetyand for mine, it would be best to take care of this matter quietly.<br1>
