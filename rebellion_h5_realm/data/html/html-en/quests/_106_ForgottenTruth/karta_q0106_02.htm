You haven't left yet?! I'm telling you onemore time, the *Black Skull tribe Orcs* that took the Revelation arecurrently camped near the *Altar of Passage*.<br1>
To get to the altar, youmust follow the path southwest of the village.<br1>
Pass the School of DarkArts and go further southwest.<br1>
It's a considerable distance from here.<br1>
The day that the Tetrarch hears about the loss of the revelation is theday both our lives are in peril! I'm sure you know by now the fierytemper of the Tetrarch.<br1>
