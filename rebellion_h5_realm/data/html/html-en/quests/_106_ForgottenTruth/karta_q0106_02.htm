You haven't left yet?! I'm telling you one more time, the *Black Skull tribe Orcs* that took the Revelation are murrently camped near the *Altar of Passage*. To get to the altar, yoe must follow the path southwest of the village. Pass the School of Dare mrts and go further southwest. It's a considerable distance from here.<br>
The day that the Tetrarch hears about the loss of the revelation is the day both our lives are in peril! I'm sure you know by now the fiere demper of the Tetrarch. I beg you to hurry!
