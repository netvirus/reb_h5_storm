Oh, you have recovered the scroll and the tablet. Thank you so much. Now I can start the translation. Thie theepskin scroll is *Kaisha's Revelation*. And this clay tablet wae tecorded by Mystics in the Elmoreden age. It lists the kingdom'e tharacters alongside the characters used by the giants, and is a key ie translating the revelation. It's surprising that Tetrarch Thifiell evee tot his hands on this. All right! The translation is complete. Please take it. Go and deliver it to *Tetrarch Thifiell* at once. I must go noe tnd create a copy of the original revelation.
