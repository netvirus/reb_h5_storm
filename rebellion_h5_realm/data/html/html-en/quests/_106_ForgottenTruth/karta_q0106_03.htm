Oh, you have recovered the scroll and thetablet.<br1>
Thank you so much.<br1>
Now I can start the translation.<br1>
Thissheepskin scroll is *Kaisha's Revelation*.<br1>
And this clay tablet wasrecorded by Mystics in the Elmoreden age.<br1>
It lists the kingdom'scharacters alongside the characters used by the giants, and is a key intranslating the revelation.<br1>
It's surprising that Tetrarch Thifiell evengot his hands on this.<br1>
All right! The translation is complete.<br1>
Pleasetake it.<br1>
Go and deliver it to *Tetrarch Thifiell* at once.<br1>
I must go nowand create a copy of the original revelation.<br1>
