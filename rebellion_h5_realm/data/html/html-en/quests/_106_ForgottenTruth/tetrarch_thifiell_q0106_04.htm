It is believed that at Honorius' execution byburning at the stake, the documents he had been translating were allburned, but there were also rumors that a portion of them had beenstolen.<br1>
The sheepskin scrolls were never found, and thus the rumors werebelieved to be false, but actually, they were hidden in the School ofDark Arts.<br1>
That they found their way to me can only be consideredShillien's will.<br1>
It's a shame that I cannot read the Revelationsproperly, because I do not know the language of the giants of ere.<br1>
So Ihave asked *Abyssal Celebrant Kartia*, who is well learned in theancient languages, to translate them for me.<br1>
It has been four days, andI think that they should have been finished by now.<br1>
I'd like you to goto the temple of Shillien, seek Abyssal Celebrant Kartia, and bring backthe *translated revelations* to me.<br1>
I'm sure it will be a learningexperience for you also.<br1>
