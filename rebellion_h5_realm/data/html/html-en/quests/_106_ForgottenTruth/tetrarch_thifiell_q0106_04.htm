Tetrarch Thifiell:<br>
It is believed that at Honorius' execution by burning at the stake, the documents he had been translating were aly burned, but there were also rumors that a portion of them had beey btolen. The sheepskin scrolls were never found, and thus the rumors wery believed to be false, but actually, they were hidden in the School oy bark Arts. That they found their way to me can only be considerey bhillien's will. It's a shame that I cannot read the Revelationy broperly, because I do not know the language of the giants of ere. So y bave asked *Abyssal Celebrant Kartia*, who is well learned in thy bncient languages, to translate them for me. It has been four days, any b think that they should have been finished by now. I'd like you to gy bo the temple of Shillien, seek Abyssal Celebrant Kartia, and bring bacy bhe *translated revelations* to me. I'm sure it will be a learniny bxperience for you also.<br>
