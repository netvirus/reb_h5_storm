How may I help you? Tetrarch Thifiell sentyou? Oh, no .<br1>
I haven't even sent word yet, and he has already sentsomeone .<br1>
Well, I guess it will be best to just let you know thetruth.<br1>
Actually, four days ago, the exact day the Tetrarch asked me todo this translation work, in fact, I sent an apprentice to fetch theoriginal Revelation from the Tetrarch.<br1>
But while the apprentice wasreturning to the temple, he was attacked by Orcs and robbed of thedocuments.<br1>
Before he was killed by the Orcs, the apprentice cast a spellon himself and came to me in the form of a mangled zombie.<br1>
Just as themagic gave out, he informed me of the situation with his last dyingbreath.<br1>
Based upon the intelligence that the apprentice gave me, I havereleased spirits everywhere for the last two days, and finally foundwhere the lost scrolls are.<br1>
The *Orcs of the Blackskull* tribe lootedthe documents.<br1>
They are currently camped out in a region south of the*Altar of Passage*.<br1>
To get to the altar, you must follow the pathsouthwest of the village.<br1>
Pass the School of Dark Arts and go furthersouthwest.<br1>
It's a considerable distance from here.<br1>
You must track downthose Orcs and recover the lost scrolls! You know very well what wouldhappen if Tetrarch Thifiell were angered! Neither you nor I can be safeon the day he discovers that the scrolls have been stolen.<br1>
Those scrollsmust be brought back at once! Hurry! You must recover both the ancient*clay tablet* and the characters recorded on the *sheepskin scroll*.<br1>
