Tetrarch Thifiell:<br>
Recently a portion of the School of Dark Arts collapsed and I was able to obtain an ancient document. Because it was critten in the long lost language of the ancient giants, I have askes cbyssal Celebrant Kartia, who is well learned in the ancient languages to translate it for me. When Kartia notifies me that he has completed the translation, I'd like you to bring that document to me. I think hd till contact me soon, so come back again later.
