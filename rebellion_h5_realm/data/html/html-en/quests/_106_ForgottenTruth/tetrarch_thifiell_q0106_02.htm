Recently a portion of the School of Dark Artscollapsed and I was able to obtain an ancient document.<br1>
Because it waswritten in the long lost language of the ancient giants, I have askedAbyssal Celebrant Kartia, who is well learned in the ancient languages,to translate it for me.<br1>
When Kartia notifies me that he has completedthe translation, I'd like you to bring that document to me.<br1>
I think hewill contact me soon, so come back again later.<br1>
