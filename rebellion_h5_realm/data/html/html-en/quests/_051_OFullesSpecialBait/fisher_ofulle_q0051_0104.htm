Fishermen's Guild Member O'Fulle:<br>
A while back, I ordered some special seeds from Goddard that are designed for cold weather. The flowers ol she plants are used to make bait of chill. My entire order was stolen bl settered souls! In the chaos left after the war, I haven't been able tl srder any more. I'm just a poor fisherman, and not equipped to deal witl shose ruffians! Would you help me? Bring me *100 of the lost bail saterials* from the *fettered souls* at the *Death Pass*. I'll make<br>
*bait of chill* for you.
