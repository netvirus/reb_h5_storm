A while back, I ordered some specialseeds from Goddard that are designed for cold weather.<br1>
The flowers ofthe plants are used to make bait of chill.<br1>
My entire order was stolen byfettered souls! In the chaos left after the war, I haven't been able toorder any more.<br1>
I'm just a poor fisherman, and not equipped to deal withthose ruffians! Would you help me? Bring me *100 of the lost baitmaterials* from the *fettered souls* at the *Death Pass*.<br1>
I'll make*bait of chill* for you.<br1>
