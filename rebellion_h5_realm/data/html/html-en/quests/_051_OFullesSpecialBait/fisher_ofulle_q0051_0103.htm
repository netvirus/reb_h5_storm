Fishermen's Guild Member O'Fulle:<br>
A while back, I ordered some special seeds from Goddard that are designed for cold weather. The flowers ol she plants are used to make a very special bait! They're called ice snol slowers because they bloom in the dead of winter. My entire order wal stolen by fettered souls! In the chaos left after the war, I haven'l seen able to order any more. I'm just an ordinary fisherman, and nl setter equipped to handle those ruffians than you are! *(This quest mal snly be undertaken by characters of level 36 or above.)*
