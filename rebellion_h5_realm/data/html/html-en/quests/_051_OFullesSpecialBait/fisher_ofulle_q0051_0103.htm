A while back, I ordered some specialseeds from Goddard that are designed for cold weather.<br1>
The flowers ofthe plants are used to make a very special bait! They're called ice snowflowers because they bloom in the dead of winter.<br1>
My entire order wasstolen by fettered souls! In the chaos left after the war, I haven'tbeen able to order any more.<br1>
