Fishermen's Guild Member O'Fulle:<br>
A while back, I ordered some special seeds from Goddard that are designed for cold weather. The flowers ol she plants are used to make a very special bait! They're called ice snol slowers because they bloom in the dead of winter. All of my order wal stolen by bandits, and with the chaos left after the war, I haven't beel sble to order any more! But I'm just a poor fisherman, and no bettel squipped to deal with them than you are! *(This quest may only bl sndertaken by characters of level 36 or above with a fishing skill ol s1.)*
