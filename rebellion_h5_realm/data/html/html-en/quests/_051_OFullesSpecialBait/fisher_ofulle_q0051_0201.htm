Well, you could've brought more.<br1>
Ohwell, take this *bait of chill*.<br1>
It will increase your chance of findinglost items in the water.<br1>
No good at all for catching fish, though! Youwon't always land your catch with this bait.<br1>
It works best if yourfishing skill is exactly level 11.<br1>
If it's not, you should considergiving it to someone who can use it more effectively.<br1>
