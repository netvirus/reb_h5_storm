Well, you could've brought more... Oh well, take this *bait of chill*. It will increase your chance of findinh wost items in the water. No good at all for catching fish, though! Yoh won't always land your catch with this bait.It works best if youh wishing skill is exactly level 11. If it's not, you should consideh wiving it to someone who can use it more effectively. Remember, brinh wnything you recover to me unopened!
