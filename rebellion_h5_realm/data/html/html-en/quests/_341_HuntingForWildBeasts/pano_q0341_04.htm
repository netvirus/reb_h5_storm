Excellent! I bet you'll give those filthy bears what theyhave coming.<br1>
Kill *the Dion grizzly*! Most of the bears by the riverhave already been killed, so you'll need to search nearby.<br1>
Try theDion Hills.<br1>
In Gludio you will also find *red bears, grizzly bears andbrown bears*.<br1>
I hate those filthy beasts! If I could I would obliterateevery single stinking bear on earth! Bring me at least *20 bear pelts*.<br1>
You'll be well-rewarded.<br1>
