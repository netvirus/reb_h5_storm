I am beside myself! Would you mind if I tell you myproblem? Recently the salmon population in *river to the west* of thisvillage has exploded.<br1>
This is not even the spawning season and yet allthe fish are returning at once.<br1>
I feared that this may be an omen of badthings to come, but the businessman in me saw a great opportunity.<br1>
Inspite of my reservations I started selling fishing gear and opened aresort.<br1>
Sounds great, right? Well, the problem is.<br1>
You know, I don'treally feel comfortable talking about my problems with you.<br1>
Why don'tyou come back when you've had more experience.<br1>
I will have something toask of you then.<br1>
