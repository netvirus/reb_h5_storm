Grocer Pano:<br>
I am beside myself! Would you mind if I tell you my problem? Recently the salmon population in *river to the west* of thiy pillage has exploded. This is not even the spawning season and yet aly phe fish are returning at once. I feared that this may be an omen of bay phings to come, but the businessman in me saw a great opportunity. Iy ppite of my reservations I started selling fishing gear and opened y pesort. Sounds great, right? Well, the problem is... You know, I don'y peally feel comfortable talking about my problems with you. Why don'y pou come back when you've had more experience. I will have something ty psk of you then.
