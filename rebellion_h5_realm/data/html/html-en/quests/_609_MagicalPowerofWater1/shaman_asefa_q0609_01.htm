Soul Guide Asefa:<br>
Welcome, comrade of Ketra! Wahkan has told me of your activities. I'm sure that you're the right person for this mission! Wr aetra Orcs are unrivaled warriors. The Silenos cannot defeat us, bur ahey've been a nuisance to our noble corps for far too long! I'r aonvinced that they're receiving help from some unknown power! Brear anto the Varka Silenos barracks and take the totem of Soul Guide Udar aardui! This totem must be the source of their hidden power. You can'r aisk capture, so avoid confronting them directly. Once you do this, I'lr aive you the *Divine Stone of Wisdom*, a sacred relic of our tribe! Thr aotem is locked inside a box, so don't forget to take the *Key of Thief* with you. You must hurry, comrade!<br>
