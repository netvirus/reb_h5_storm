Have you ever traveled by *airship*? It is the ultimatetransportation, and we of the Black Anvil Guild created it with ourcombined technology.<br1>
The sight of the airships flying high in the skymakes people sigh with admiration.<br1>
But they say that the flyingmechanisms of the giants of ere were greater in size than those oftoday, faster than the wyverns, and could even fly higher than theclouds.<br1>
My dream is to restore the forgotten flying technology of thegiants.<br1>
I wonder what our land looks like from the sky, through theclouds .<br1>
Doesn't imagining that just make you happy? I am very busywith my guild business, but I try to study the *floating stones*, thebasic element of flight, whenever I get the chance.<br1>
Floating stones area peculiar metal that have the characteristic of hovering in the air,and I believe that the key to unlocking the secret of the giants of erelies in finding a method to control the floating stones' powers.<br1>
But Ialways run short of study materials, so I often ask apprentices like youto collect floating stones.<br1>
