Floating stones are not as hard to find as you think.<br1>
Haveyou seen creatures such as monster eyes and magical weavers? They canfly through the air because they have floating stones in their bodies.<br1>
Maybe the scholars were correct when they said monster eyes wereartificial creatures created by the giants of ere.<br1>
Anyway, there aremany *magical weavers* in the Spine Mine Field, so you should hunt themand collect *floating stones*.<br1>
If you collect and bring *fifty* floatingstones, I will reward you.<br1>
