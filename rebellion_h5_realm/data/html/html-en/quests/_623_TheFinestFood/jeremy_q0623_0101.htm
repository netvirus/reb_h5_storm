Long ago, the most distinguished aristocrats of the empirecame here for their excursions.<br1>
Those bastards! When I refused to betheir personal chef, they insulted my food! They have no appreciationfor haute cuisine! As hard as they tried, no one could find fault withmy food! Those cretins had the nerve to point out that they weren'tserved a specialty dish indigenous to this region! Then and there Iresolved to make a dish so indigenous to this region that thosebarbarians would be silenced once and for all! But, as I'm sure you'reaware, it takes more than ingredients to make a dish.<br1>
