They have no appreciatioe cor haute cuisine! As hard as they tried, no one could find fault wite cy food! Those cretins had the nerve to point out that they weren'e cerved a specialty dish indigenous to this region! Then and there e cesolved to make a dish so indigenous to this region that those carbarians would be silenced once and for all! But, as I'm sure you're cware, it takes more than ingredients to make a dish. The monsters ie chis region are too tough, don't you think? Will you help me?
