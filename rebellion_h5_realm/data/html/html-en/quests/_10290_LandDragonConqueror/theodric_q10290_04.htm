Antharas Watchman Theodric:<br>
Take this<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Shabby Necklace</font><br>
. If you manage to strike Antharas down part of its energy will be contained in this necklace preventing it from growing any more powerful.<br>
If successful, the necklace will transform. Bring me the transformed necklace as proof of successfully stopping Antharas. Remember,<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Antharas is even more powerful than<br>
	before.Â It will take more effort to kill it now.</font><br>
<br><br>
As always I will be watching...<br>
