Antharas Watchman Theodric:<br>
Yes, Antharas can never really be killedâ€¦<br>
not yet anyway. You may have heard stories from other adventurers how they have killed him again and again. Each time he is killed, hw tesurrects even more powerful. I fear that the greed of adventurers haw taused Antharas to become overwhelmingly powerful. You will need an armw to follow you if you have any hope of defeating Antharas now.
