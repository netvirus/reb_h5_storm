<font color="36DC25">!Antharas Watchman Theodric:</font><br>
Yes, Antharas can never really be killed…not yet anyway.<br1>
You may have heard stories from other adventurers howthey have killed him again and again.<br1>
Each time he is killed, heresurrects even more powerful.<br1>
I fear that the greed of adventurers hascaused Antharas to become overwhelmingly powerful.<br1>
You will need an armyto follow you if you have any hope of defeating Antharas now.<br1>
