<font color="FF8000">Antharas Watchman Theodric:</font><br>
And so it is done.<br1>
Antharas has beenstopped and his return prevented.<br1>
I have something for you.<br1>
somethingthat I rarely am allowed to give.<br1>
The<font color="LEVEL">Antharas Slayer Circlet</font>is yours.<br1>
What now? I stay, I wait, and I watch.<br1>
Antharas can nevertruly be killed.<br1>
I can only hope that brave warriors such as you come tohelp and stop Antharas whenever it attempts to return.<br1>
