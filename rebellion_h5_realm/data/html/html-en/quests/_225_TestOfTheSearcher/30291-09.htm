Hmmm, it seems the royal guards hid the gold before it reachedthe prince! Now we can be sure that the gold exists, our only problemremaining is how to find it.<br1>
First, of course, we must find the *other 3parts of the map* I am afraid that the delu lizardmen are also on thesearch for the gold, and their numbers are increasing.<br1>
