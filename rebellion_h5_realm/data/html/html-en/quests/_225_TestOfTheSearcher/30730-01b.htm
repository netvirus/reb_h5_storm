I buried the gold in the Dion's southern forest.<br1>
We madea map to the place, divided into 4 pieces and gave took 1 piece each.<br1>
Wecould never find it again with just 1 piece.<br1>
I knew that the gold wascursed after I heard about the unfortunate deaths of my 3 comrades.<br1>
So Idecided to forget it all and live quietly here.<br1>
