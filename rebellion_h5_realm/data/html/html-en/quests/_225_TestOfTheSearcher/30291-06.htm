I believe this map will lead us to the prince's gold! I wonderhow that delu lizardman got this? If we can get to the gold before ouropponents we will be able to hire soldiers and buy weapons with which todefend the village.<br1>
Think of this as your last test.<br1>
You must find theother parts of this map and *get the prince's lost gold bar*.<br1>
Whetheryou are successful or not, I will write you the letter of recommendationyou need.<br1>
