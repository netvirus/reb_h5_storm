Ahh.<br1>
This is it! Outstanding! My tongue isloosed by the fragrant nectar.<br1>
Obviously the Lord's gold was beingtransported from Gludin to Dion.<br1>
The 4 royal Guards carrying the goldschemed to hide it away.<br1>
The Lord unsuccessfully pursued them.<br1>
Somehowpeople got the idea that they perished in an accident.<br1>
.<br1>
Actually, one ofthem, named Rovelt, is still alive.<br1>
Now he goes by *Guard Jacks* andguards the Dwarf traders.<br1>
He is probably somewhere in *the southern partof the Wastelands* now.<br1>
He will tell you everything if show him this.<br1>
Take it and go, my young friend.<br1>
