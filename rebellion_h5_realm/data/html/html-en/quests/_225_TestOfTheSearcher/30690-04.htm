Did you come for the Mark of the Searcher? The Mark isgiven to those who's ability for 'finding hidden things' is recognized.<br1>
Every year, numerous Hunters, Scouts, Excavators and even some Assassinscome to me in hope of receiving the *Test of the Searcher* but a Dwarflike you.<br1>
Are you a Master Raider applicant by any chance? I heardthat they were the best Hunters among the Dwarfs.<br1>
But even within theDwarf Guild, not everybody is given such title.<br1>
It is said that onlythose who have proven their hunting skills and acquired the Mark of theSearcher are qualified for a Master Raider.<br1>
If you wish to take theexamination, I will gladly arrange it for you.<br1>
