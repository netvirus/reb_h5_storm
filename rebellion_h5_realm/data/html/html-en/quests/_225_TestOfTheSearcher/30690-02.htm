Did you come for the Mark of the Searcher? TheSearcher's Mark is given to those who's ability for 'finding hiddenthings' is recognized.<br1>
Every year, numerous Hunters, Scouts, Excavatorsand even some Assassins come to me in hope of receiving the *'Test ofthe Searcher'* but I don't think that you are experienced enough to takethe examination.<br1>
Come back after you have improved your abilities.<br1>
