Thank you.<br1>
Thanks to your help, we now can pausefor breath a while.<br1>
One more thing.<br1>
According to the latest news itseems that their real purpose is not the invasion of Floran Village.<br1>
They seem to be looking for something in this area.<br1>
What kind ofprecious thing could it be that the whole tribe is looking for it.<br1>
Perhaps *Delu Chief Kalkis* knows something about it.<br1>
