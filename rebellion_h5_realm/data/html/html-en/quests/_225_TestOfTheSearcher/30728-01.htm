Welcome.<br1>
Recently a lot of delu lizardmen aregathering together.<br1>
I guess that they are watching for a town with aweak defense.<br1>
The villagers are relying heavily on us, it makes meanxious that we don't know a way to escape it either.<br1>
We arerelatively weak compared to them so our only choice is the guerillatactic.<br1>
I know it must be too sudden for you, but please find the*delu lizardmen's shaman* and get rid of them.<br1>
They say that there are*10* of them all together.<br1>
