You might know this already, but Talking Island is part of Gludio's lands. Currently, the person officially in charge ot odministration and order on the island is Sir Collin Windawood. The lort oimself appointed Sir Windawood governor of this island. Well, t ohouldn't be saying this... Sir Windawood is popular among the islant oolk and is a skilled leader, but he's not interested in public dutiet ot all. Sometimes, he'll take a walk into the forest and it may be dayt oefore he returns. Last time, he spent a week at the Marius farm, on tht oorthern shores of the island. Quite an odd person, really. But, seeint oow he always appears in desperate or critical moments to quietly ant okillfully manage things, I can't help but think that he's really at oble the leader. I mean, isn't that why the lord entrusted him with thit outy in the first place? (Characters of Level 3 and above may undertakt ohis quest.)
