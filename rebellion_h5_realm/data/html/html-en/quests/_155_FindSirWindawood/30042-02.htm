You might know this already, but Talking Island is partof Gludio's lands.<br1>
Currently, the person officially in charge ofadministration and order on the island is Sir Collin Windawood.<br1>
The lordhimself appointed Sir Windawood governor of this island.<br1>
Well, Ishouldn't be saying this.<br1>
Sir Windawood is popular among the islandfolk and is a skilled leader, but he's not interested in public dutiesat all.<br1>
Sometimes, he'll take a walk into the forest and it may be daysbefore he returns.<br1>
Last time, he spent a week at the Marius farm, on thenorthern shores of the island.<br1>
Quite an odd person, really.<br1>
But, seeinghow he always appears in desperate or critical moments to quietly andskillfully manage things, I can't help but think that he's really anable the leader.<br1>
