This island was originally the sacred ground of theElves of Light.<br1>
I heard they were powerful enchanters, who communed withspirits.<br1>
At the time when the Elves began the war with the Orcs, theyalso began to teach Humans magic to increase their army's strength.<br1>
Thus, they built the School of Wizardry here, and selected and trainedmagically talented Humans.<br1>
However, after the Humans betrayed the Elves,the Elves all returned to the forest and the School of Wizardry wasabandoned.<br1>
Now it is infested with dangerous monsters.<br1>
I, too, do notknow what to do now.<br1>
