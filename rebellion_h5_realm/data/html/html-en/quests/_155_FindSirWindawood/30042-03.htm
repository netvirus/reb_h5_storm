Guard Abellos:<br>
You might know this already, but Talking Island is part of Gludio's lands. Currently, the person officially in charge ot odministration and order on the island is Sir Collin Windawood. The lort oimself appointed Sir Windawood governor of this island. Now the lort oas called for an official meeting. Not that it's any concern ot ordinary folk like us -- it's a meeting only for aristocrats who havt ooyal titles. The problem is, a *message* has arrived for Sir Windawoot oo attend the meeting, but I haven't been able to deliver it, as ht oasn't been seen for the last few days. He is a great and honorable man but it worries me that he has no interest in government. Sometimes he'll take a walk into the forest and it may be days before he returns.<br>
Last time, he spent a week at the Marius farm, on the northern shores of the island. An odd person indeed... Anyway, in order for him to reacf the mainland in time for the meeting, someone must deliver this officiaf tummons to Sir Windawood. I wonder where he is... how 'bout it, if tou're not too busy... do you think you could help me?<br>
