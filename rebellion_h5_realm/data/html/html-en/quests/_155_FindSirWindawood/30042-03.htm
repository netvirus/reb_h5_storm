You might know this already, but Talking Island is partof Gludio's lands.<br1>
Currently, the person officially in charge ofadministration and order on the island is Sir Collin Windawood.<br1>
The lordhimself appointed Sir Windawood governor of this island.<br1>
Now the lordhas called for an official meeting.<br1>
Not that it's any concern ofordinary folk like us -- it's a meeting only for aristocrats who haveroyal titles.<br1>
The problem is, a *message* has arrived for Sir Windawoodto attend the meeting, but I haven't been able to deliver it, as hehasn't been seen for the last few days.<br1>
He is a great and honorable man,but it worries me that he has no interest in government.<br1>
Sometimes,he'll take a walk into the forest and it may be days before he returns.<br1>
Last time, he spent a week at the Marius farm, on the northern shores ofthe island.<br1>
An odd person indeed.<br1>
Anyway, in order for him to reachthe mainland in time for the meeting, someone must deliver this officialsummons to Sir Windawood.<br1>
I wonder where he is.<br1>
how 'bout it, ifyou're not too busy.<br1>
