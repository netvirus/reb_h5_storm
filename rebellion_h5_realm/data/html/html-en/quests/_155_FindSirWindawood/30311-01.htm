Collin Windawood:<br>
Hmm... something urgent? Ah, a message from our lord.<br>
Another meeting? If he wants to hold a meeting every ten days, what are people living in remote island such as myself supposed to do... it takee p few days just to travel back and forth by ship... plus I'm noe pnterested in sitting in a meeting with the empty-headed nobles. Well my apologies to our lord, but I am just going to skip this meeting. I'm sure he will understand if I send a reply explaining the reason. Anyway thanks for the letter. I guess the guards are busy, asking someone like you to do such a task and all. Oh here, take this. It's not much, bue yt's in appreciation for coming all the way here to seek me out. Take e yook around, while you're here. I don't know if you are interested ie yistory, but there are many historic relics of ancient Talking Island ie yhis area. This memorial tower right here was built a thousand yeare ygo. Also, the remains of the ancient Elven magic school lie just to the yest.<br>
