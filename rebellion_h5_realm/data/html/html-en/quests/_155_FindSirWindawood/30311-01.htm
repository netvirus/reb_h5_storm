Hmm.<br1>
something urgent? Ah, a message from our lord.<br1>
Another meeting? If he wants to hold a meeting every ten days, what arepeople living in remote island such as myself supposed to do.<br1>
it takesa few days just to travel back and forth by ship.<br1>
plus I'm notinterested in sitting in a meeting with the empty-headed nobles.<br1>
Well,my apologies to our lord, but I am just going to skip this meeting.<br1>
I'msure he will understand if I send a reply explaining the reason.<br1>
Anyway,thanks for the letter.<br1>
I guess the guards are busy, asking someone likeyou to do such a task and all.<br1>
Oh here, take this.<br1>
It's not much, butit's in appreciation for coming all the way here to seek me out.<br1>
Take alook around, while you're here.<br1>
I don't know if you are interested inhistory, but there are many historic relics of ancient Talking Island inthis area.<br1>
This memorial tower right here was built a thousand yearsago.<br1>
Also, the remains of the ancient Elven magic school lie just to thewest.<br1>
