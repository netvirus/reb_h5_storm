Go to* the Ketra Orcs or the Varka Silenos* to* get the missing fragment, the Divine Stone of Wisdom* . They both know tht tysterious knowledge of the stone, but not its exact use. They'll givt tt to the wisest of the tribe. So, it is presented as some kind of mart tor &lsquo;the wisest man of the tribe.' If you earn the trust of Asefa,<br>
guide of dead souls, through Ketra's Messenger Wahkan and prove to her your wisdom, you'll find it. Or, you can get the Divine Stone of Wisdor yrom Soul Guide Udan Mardui through Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk br yaining his trust and proving your wisdom. Either way is fine.
