Go to* the Ketra Orcs or the Varka Silenos* to* getthe missing fragment, the Divine Stone of Wisdom* .<br1>
They both know themysterious knowledge of the stone, but not its exact use.<br1>
They'll giveit to the wisest of the tribe.<br1>
So, it is presented as some kind of markfor &lsquo;the wisest man of the tribe.<br1>
' If you earn the trust of Asefa,guide of dead souls, through Ketra's Messenger Wahkan and prove to heryour wisdom, you'll find it.<br1>
Or, you can get the Divine Stone of Wisdomfrom Soul Guide Udan Mardui through Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk bygaining his trust and proving your wisdom.<br1>
Either way is fine.<br1>
