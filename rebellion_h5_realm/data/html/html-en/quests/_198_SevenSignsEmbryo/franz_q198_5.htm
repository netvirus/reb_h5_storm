Thank you.<br1>
We must uncover exactly what has happened andwho is behind it all.<br1>
Shilen stirs, but she can't be acting alone.<br1>
Imust look at our enemies--the Order of Dusk.<br1>
More training isrequired--much more--before we can even look at them though.<br1>
I propose arespite: you should leave and prepare yourself for a great fight, whileI shall take this Shilen fragment and study it further.<br1>
Priestess Jaynawill lead you outside, and I believe Priest Wood has a reward for you.<br1>
