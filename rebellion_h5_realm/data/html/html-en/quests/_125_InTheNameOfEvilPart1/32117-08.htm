I know very well where the dinosaurs live.<br1>
If you leave thisplace with Kariachin's help and go up north, you will find a cave linkedto an area of the Lost Nest.<br1>
Enter it and you will find the dinosaurseasily.<br1>
Once among them, hunt<font color="LEVEL">Ornithomimus and Deinonychus</font>and gather their claws and bone fragments for the ritual.<br1>
Once you haveobtained more than two of each of them, return here.<br1>
In the meantime, Iwill prepare another part of the ritual.<br1>
