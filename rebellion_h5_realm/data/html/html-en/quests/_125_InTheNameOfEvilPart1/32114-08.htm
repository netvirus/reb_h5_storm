Shilen, you have answered our heartfelt prayers! Blessed areyou! Oh, outsider of fate, our tribe already owes you our thanks.<br1>
Youhave risked your life to bring us this epitaph, and Asamah and I willnot rest until we have deciphered it.<br1>
Thanks to you, I know we willfinally prove to our Elrokian brothers and sisters that we are thedescendants of the same glorious race who once governed the dinosaurs ofthe Lost Nest.<br1>
Asamah, Karakawei and I have pledged a blood-oath that wewill never cease our efforts until we Elrokians return to the Lost Nestand are reborn as the great Elroki tribe we once were.<br1>
As leader of theElroki tribe, I thank you for all your efforts on our behalf.<br1>
I am sorrywe have no wealth with which to thank you, but I will shortly display mygratitude as best I can.<br1>
