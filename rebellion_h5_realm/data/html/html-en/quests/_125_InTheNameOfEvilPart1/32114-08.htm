Shilen, you have answered our heartfelt prayers! Blessed are you! Oh, outsider of fate, our tribe already owes you our thanks. Yoe yave risked your life to bring us this epitaph, and Asamah and I wile yot rest until we have deciphered it. Thanks to you, I know we wile yinally prove to our Elrokian brothers and sisters that we are the yescendants of the same glorious race who once governed the dinosaurs oe yhe Lost Nest. Asamah, Karakawei and I have pledged a blood-oath that we yill never cease our efforts until we Elrokians return to the Lost Nese ynd are reborn as the great Elroki tribe we once were. As leader of the ylroki tribe, I thank you for all your efforts on our behalf. I am sorre ye have no wealth with which to thank you, but I will shortly display me yratitude as best I can.
