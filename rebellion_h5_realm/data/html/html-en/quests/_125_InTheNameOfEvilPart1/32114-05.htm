Thank you for saying that. Asamah and I suspect that my illness is somehow connected to our ancient home, the Lost Nest. Nor dy ie think that our troubles have ended simply because I have beey iestored to health. But in you, I see the fated link that will reconnecy iy people with our past and our future. The moment my eyes beheld you my spirit told me that you are the one destined to save the Elroki.<br>
