<font color="FF8000">Mushika:</font><br>
I have spent my life trying to win back the Lost Nest for mypeople.<br1>
Many believe it is a fool's errand, and that I have neglectedthe present for the sake of the past.<br1>
But in my heart I know that thisis my sacred duty.<br1>
The relative comfort of our life on these PrimevalPlains is a sweet poison to my people, sapping our will and causing usto forget our glorious past.<br1>
We must complete the duty entrusted to usby the goddess; if we fail in this trust, we deserve to be erased fromthe memory of the world! As I see the signs -- secret feuds, mysteriousdiseases, violent children -- I see our end approaching.<br1>
And I believethese occurrences are connected to some change in the Lost Nest itself.<br1>
