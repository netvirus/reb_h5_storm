Mushika suspects that the last of the ancient Elrokianwarriors, whose truth has been hidden under the veil of years, theancient relic he himself once brought out of the Lost Nest, and thecause of his present illness are all related.<br1>
But none know how thiscould be, which is why we need the wisdom of that magic stone pillar,whom legend says observes and remembers all that occurs on this island.<br1>
