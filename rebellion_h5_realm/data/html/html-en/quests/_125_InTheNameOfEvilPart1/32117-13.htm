<font color="36DC25">!Karakawei:</font><br>
The ancestors have told me that the word is<font color="LEVEL">tepu</font>.<br1>
And they have also revealed that the monument stands beneath a tree atthe end of the<font color="LEVEL">northeast</font>part of the Lost Nest.<br1>
This was all I heard before my strength wasexhausted and my spirit fled back to my body.<br1>
But I fear that you willface obstacles on this journey that I cannot foresee.<br1>
