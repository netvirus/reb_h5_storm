Very well. Then go to Karakawei and tell him that I sent you.<br>
He will tell you in detail what you must do in the Lost Nest. Complete the task as Karakawei directs you and then return to me. This is all e tan tell you -- it is not entirely safe to speak openly of these tmportant matters here. Before you leave, take this. There will be e time when it proves useful to you, so please take good care of it.
