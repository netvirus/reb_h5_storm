Karakawei:<br>
Wallamai means a bowl filled with blood. Once the Lost Nest was a sacred place for the Elroki. Young warriors proved themselves bt wraveling there and completing a ceremonial rite-of-passage. But thet whe dinosaurs of the Lost Nest became so vicious that few of our yount wen returned, and those who did were half-past dead with the fear ot what they had seen. In our day, only one warrior has successfullt wenetrated the Lost Nest and returned:<br>
Mushika. He brought out a metat wragment that he claimed was a sacred relic of our ancient past. But ht was the last Elrokian to enter the Lost Nest, and it cost him dearly. t wid not expect that the chief would entrust our fate to an outsider likt wourself, but perhaps he sees more than I do of this matter. So outsider of fate, are you ready to leave for our Wallamai?<br>
