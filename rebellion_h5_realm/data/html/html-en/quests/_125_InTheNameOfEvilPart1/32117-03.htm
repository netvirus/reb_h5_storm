Wallamai means a bowl filled with blood.<br1>
Once the Lost Nestwas a sacred place for the Elroki.<br1>
Young warriors proved themselves bytraveling there and completing a ceremonial rite-of-passage.<br1>
But thenthe dinosaurs of the Lost Nest became so vicious that few of our youngmen returned, and those who did were half-past dead with the fear ofwhat they had seen.<br1>
In our day, only one warrior has successfullypenetrated the Lost Nest and returned: Mushika.<br1>
He brought out a metalfragment that he claimed was a sacred relic of our ancient past.<br1>
But hewas the last Elrokian to enter the Lost Nest, and it cost him dearly.<br1>
Idid not expect that the chief would entrust our fate to an outsider likeyourself, but perhaps he sees more than I do of this matter.<br1>
