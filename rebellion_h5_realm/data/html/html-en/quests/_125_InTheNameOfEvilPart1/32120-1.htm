Balu Kaimu:<br>
To meet my brother, Chuta Kaimu, start here and travel<br>
 southwest<br>
. You will find him where the road ends. To wake him from his slumber speak only the word<br>
 wagu<br>
, the same word that my mother Shilen spoke when she gave him life.<br>
Possibly he will share his wisdom with you.
