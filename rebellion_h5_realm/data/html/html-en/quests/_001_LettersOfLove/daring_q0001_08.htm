Roxxy's handkerchief!<br1>
Oh, she really likes me! It seems like a dream...<br1>
Thank you! If not for you, I would never have known.<br1>
I must speak with her. So much to do: buy flowers, bathe, get dressed in my finest clothes...<br1>
Oh, I must hurry! I hate to impose, but would you do me another favor?<br1>
Baulro promised that he would brew a magic potion to make me more eloquent.<br1>
I know how much a woman like Roxxy values intelligence...<br1>
It wasn't cheap, but I couldn't afford not to buy it.<br1>
Please take this receipt to *Baulro*, and he will give you the potion to bring back to me.<br>
