Darin sent you, eh?<br1>
Well, well...<br1>
He's a fine lad, but far too shy for his own good.<br1>
I'm glad he's finally decided to tell Roxxy his feelings, though.<br1>
None but the brave deserve the fair, eh!<br>
Here's the "magic potion" he ordered.<br1>
Just between us, it's nothing more than water drawn from the Temple well! Calm down -- I really do have Darin's best interests at heart.<br1>
Think about it: if he believes that this will make him more eloquent, his self-confidence will soar and he really will find the words he needs.<br1>
Now take it to him, and remember: not a word about the ingredients!<br>
