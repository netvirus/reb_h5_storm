Trust.<br1>
How dare you ask for such a thing fromus.<br1>
Remember the infamous betrayer Dasparion? He was of your race! Andit was Human Wizards who sealed our leader! How could we possibly trustthe Humans? Do you think that all the past injustices can be forgottenwith a simple letter? You fool! I will never understand Humans!.<br1>
However, we have been expecting the *Chaotic Chronicle* as have you.<br1>
When that dark time arrives we may have to cooperate in order tosurvive.<br1>
I suppose that, for such reasons, we should try to recoverthe trust between our races.<br1>
But trust is not something that can begiven freely.<br1>
If you exhibit true sincerity, I'll consider yourproposal.<br1>
We have tried for centuries to break the magic spell on ourHierarch Mitraell.<br1>
He is privy to the secrets of Shilen and the *Queenof Destruction*, more than anyone else.<br1>
It is no exaggeration to saythat he holds a vital clue to the upcoming Chaotic Chronicle.<br1>
*You mustcollect the research materials regarding the release of our leader.<br1>
* Idon't feel bad about asking for your help, since it was your ancestorswho sealed our Hierarch.<br1>
Take this letter to *Magister Clayton of theTown of Dion*.<br1>
He will give you the list of materials to collect.<br1>
