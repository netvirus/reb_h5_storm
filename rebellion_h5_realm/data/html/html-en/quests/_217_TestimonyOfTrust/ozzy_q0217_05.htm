Thank you.<br1>
The breath of the wind will clear theforest air and seedlings of new life will spring from the earth.<br1>
As ourElven Forest slowly recovers from its wounds, so will our trust inHumans recover.<br1>
Here is a letter, but you must not expect absolute trustjust yet.<br1>
The future relations between our races depends largely on howHumans behave from now on.<br1>
We will be watching.<br1>
Especially youngpeople like you.<br1>
By the way, let me guess where you are off to now.<br1>
I'll wager you are going to try to meet those poor Dark Elves.<br1>
Youmust take care.<br1>
They are not trustworthy.<br1>
