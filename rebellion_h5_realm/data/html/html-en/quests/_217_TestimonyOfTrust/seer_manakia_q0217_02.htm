Recently a delegation from the Neruga tribe were savagelyattacked by a pack of wild boars as they were traveling to Aden Castle!These bestial boars are called the *windsus*, and are known to livearound Death Pass in Northern Giran.<br1>
Long ago, the Lota tribe, whosetotem was a wild boar, was annihilated there.<br1>
After the slaughter, theirtotem was buried alive on the spot.<br1>
It appears that his spirit haspossessed the wild boars in the area! Some brave warriors from theHestui tribe gave their lives to give us this information.<br1>
Can you helpus? Kill the windsus and you'll find a small parasitic insect in theirflesh.<br1>
This is the *Parasite of Lota*, and is apparently the cause ofthe boars' behavior.<br1>
Collect 10 parasites and bring them to me.<br1>
