<font color="36DC25">Hierarch Asterios:</font><br>
In the Elven Forest, the spirits of the wind and thetrees are becoming vicious.<br1>
If we can ameliorate the leaders of thesespirits we will probably be able to suppress this disturbance.<br1>
TheChief of the wind spirit lireins is called *Luell of Zephyr Winds*.<br1>
Youcan meet her if you follow the *lireins*.<br1>
And the Chief of the treespirits is called *Actea of Verdant Wilds*.<br1>
You will find him if youhunt for the *dryads*.<br1>
I wish you success.<br1>
May you have the blessingof the starlight.<br1>
