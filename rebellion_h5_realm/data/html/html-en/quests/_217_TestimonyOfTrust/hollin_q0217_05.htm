Thank you.<br1>
It is hard to determine from theirresponse whether we have truly earned their trust, but this is animportant first step towards establishing a better relationship.<br1>
Now itis time for you to attempt to recover the trust of the Orcs and Dwarves.<br1>
First, meet with *Cardinal Seresin* of this town.<br1>
He is one of many whoare working to recover trust between the races.<br1>
He will be helpful toyou.<br1>
