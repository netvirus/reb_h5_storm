Please gather all 3 materials that I have told you.<br1>
Should I explain one more time? I have noticed that your people tend toforget things easily because they are hot tempered.<br1>
Hunt *the guardianbasilisk*from the Corridor of Death and collect 10 bottles of itsblood.<br1>
That will make *basilisk plasma*.<br1>
And from the Wastelands hunt*the soldier ant *and out of the 10 aphids you'll be able to get*honeydew*.<br1>
Last, from*the swamp stakato* of Cruma marshland gather 10bottles of the creature's body fluid and you'll get*a stakato ichor*.<br1>
