You don't have the money, skills or background toeven think of visiting a foreign country through the gate of time andspace! You must be an idiot! Believe me, I'm telling you this for yourown good! Don't embarrass yourself and your race! You'd certainly makethe same mistake that *Sentry Roselyn* made such a long time ago!Adventure and romance should be left to those who can handle it! Itseemed for a while that she had learned from her grievious mistake, butrecently she's been showing signs of her old reckless and foolish ways.<br1>
I guess some people never learn! You cannot travel through this gate.<br1>
Anyway, according to the rules of our guild, no one may travel to Giranthrough this gate of time and space.<br1>
