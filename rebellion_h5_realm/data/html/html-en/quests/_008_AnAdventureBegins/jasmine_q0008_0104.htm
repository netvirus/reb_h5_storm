Gatekeeper Jasmine:<br>
You don't have the money, skills or background to even think of visiting a foreign country through the gate of time and space!<br1>
You must be an idiot!<br1>
Believe me, I'm telling you this for your own good!<br1>
Don't embarrass yourself and your race! You'd certainly make the same mistake that *Sentry Roselyn* made such a long time ago!<br1>
Adventure and romance should be left to those who can handle it!<br1>
It seemed for a while that she had learned from her grievious mistake, but recently she's been showing signs of her old reckless and foolish ways.<br1>
I guess some people never learn!<br1>
You cannot travel through this gate.<br1>
Anyway, according to the rules of our guild, no one may travel to Giran through this gate of time and space.
