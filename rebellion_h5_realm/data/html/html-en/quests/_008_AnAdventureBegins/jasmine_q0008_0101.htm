Gatekeeper Jasmine:<br>
You can visit many different places through the gate of time and space.<br1>
The most cosmopolitan place of all is *Giran Castle Town*! I wasn't there for long, but I can tell you that it's a very dynamic, vibrant place.<br1>
There are all sorts of people searching for adventure and romance there.<br1>
The village is something of a world unto itself!<br1>
You simply must visit it sometime...<br>
