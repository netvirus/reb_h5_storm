You can visit many different places through thegate of time and space.<br1>
The most cosmopolitan place of all is *GiranCastle Town*! I wasn't there for long, but I can tell you that it's avery dynamic, vibrant place.<br1>
There are all sorts of people searching foradventure and romance there.<br1>
The village is something of a world untoitself! You simply must visit it sometime.<br1>
