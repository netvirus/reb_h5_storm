Gatekeeper Jasmine:<br>
I'm afraid Giran may be too much for you right now.<br1>
I can't send you there from here.<br1>
If you insist on going there, take this *Mark of Traveler* and *Scroll of Escape to Giran Castle Town*.<br1>
The magic scroll allows you to instantaneously travel to *Giran*, but remember, it only works once.<br1>
Use it wisely.<br1>
When you're read to return, take the *Mark of Traveler* to *Galladucci* at his boutique.<br1>
He'll help you.<br1>
Among all the Human cities, *Giran* is, by far, the loudest and most violent.<br1>
Watch your back and have a safe trip!
