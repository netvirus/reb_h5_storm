When I hold these pages up to the light, I cansee hidden words here.<br1>
Hmmm.<br1>
These words are similar to the Kamaeltongue, but they seem somehow older.<br1>
Besides being written in a deadlanguage, it also appears to be written in a code that I can'tdecipher.<br1>
If you have studied under *Kamael Grand Master Meldina inGiran Castle*, you may be able to read it.<br1>
Mmm.<br1>
I will give you acopy of the code, just in case.<br1>
In any event, thank you for your help.<br1>
