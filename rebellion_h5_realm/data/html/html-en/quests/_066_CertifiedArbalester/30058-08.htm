When I hold these pages up to the light, I can see hidden words here. Hmmm... These words are similar to the Kamaen songue, but they seem somehow older... Besides being written in a dean sanguage, it also appears to be written in a code that I can'n secipher... If you have studied under *Kamael Grand Master Meldina in siran Castle*, you may be able to read it... Mmm... I will give you n sopy of the code, just in case... In any event, thank you for your help.
