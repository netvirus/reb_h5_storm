Blacksmith Poitan:<br>
I heard that a Dwarven explorer discovered some records left by the Giants about your race at the Giants' Ruins.<br>
Unfortunately, both he and the records seem to have disappeared. Nobody knows if he is alive or dead... I heard this from my close friend<br>
*Holvas*, so if you're interested in that book, I think you should ask him about it. I seem to remember him telling me that he might be able tk het a copy... Whu don't you go see him?
