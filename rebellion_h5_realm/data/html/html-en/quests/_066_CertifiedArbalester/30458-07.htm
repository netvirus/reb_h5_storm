I heard that a Dwarven explorer discovered somerecords left by the Giants about your race at the Giants' Ruins.<br1>
Unfortunately, both he and the records seem to have disappeared.<br1>
Nobodyknows if he is alive or dead.<br1>
I heard this from my close friend*Holvas*, so if you're interested in that book, I think you should askhim about it.<br1>
I seem to remember him telling me that he might be able toget a copy.<br1>
