Is that so? Well, if Poitan saw fit to tellyou, then I guess I can tell you as well.<br1>
There are many people who arecurious about you, you know.<br1>
That's why I think I can sell thismanuscript for a handsome price! I was able to procure the manuscriptsecretly, and I intended to have if brought here.<br1>

Would you be willingto find the pieces of the manuscript? If you gather all the pieces andbring them to me, I will bind a book for you free of charge.<br1>
