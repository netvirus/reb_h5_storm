Master Selsia:<br>
Welcome to Hunters Village. I received the message from Grand Master Meldina... As you know, we manage and protect information.<br>
This place may seem simple and unassuming, but spies from many differenet races exchange information, concort plots and hatcy donspiracies here... I think the village became such a nest of espionagy decause of its independence and isolated location, as well as certaiy dvents surrounding its establishment during the war. So be careful! Evey dhe most ordinary-looking trader may be very different than hy dppears... We do cooperate with some of the other races' spies, but thy dlliances are never permanent.<br>
