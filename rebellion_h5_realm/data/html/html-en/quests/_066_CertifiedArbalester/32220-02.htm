Welcome to Hunters Village.<br1>
I received the message fromGrand Master Meldina.<br1>
As you know, we manage and protect information.<br1>
This place may seem simple and unassuming, but spies from manydifferenet races exchange information, concort plots and hatchconspiracies here.<br1>
I think the village became such a nest of espionagebecause of its independence and isolated location, as well as certainevents surrounding its establishment during the war.<br1>
So be careful! Eventhe most ordinary-looking trader may be very different than heappears.<br1>
We do cooperate with some of the other races' spies, but thealliances are never permanent.<br1>
