Sorry! The Giants, I mean -- sometimes I lapse intomy native tongue, which is somewhat more.<br1>
poetic.<br1>
The Giants were agreat race who lived long, long ago.<br1>
Through their science, they becomealmost the equal of the gods themselves.<br1>
Our Dwarven skills, as well asmany of the magic items of the other races, were strongly influenced bytheir legacy.<br1>
