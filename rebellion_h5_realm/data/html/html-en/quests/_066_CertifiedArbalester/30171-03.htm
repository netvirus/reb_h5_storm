Well, one of the followers of that villain Belethmanaged to obtain certain secrets about the Kamael.<br1>
They were in adocument that contained excerpts of medical research conducted by theGiants.<br1>
Our lord discovered that this information was passed to theother followers of Beleth in Oren, then spread magically to otherunknown places.<br1>
The original spy is high-ranking official in Giran,however, and we simply did have sufficient evidence to expose him asBeleth's follower.<br1>
This situation was extremely urgent, and theresimply was no other way for us to handle matters.<br1>
I hope youunderstand.<br1>
