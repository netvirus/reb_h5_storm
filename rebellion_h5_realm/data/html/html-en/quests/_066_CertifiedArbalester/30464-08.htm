Ah, finally finished! My magical experiment isactually only a part of a much larger scheme designed to release theseal of our greatest elder.<br1>
This elder has existed since ancient times,so he may also have been alive when your race was created.<br1>
As fat as Iknow, your race was relatively free from the influence of the gods onthis continent -- what you call the Outer World.<br1>
It is said that thiswas due to some unique feature of your race and uts origin.<br1>
I do notknow any details beyond that.<br1>
Perhaps the Dwarves possess moreinformation -- they have held on to many of the ancient secrets in theirquest to rediscover the Giants' science.<br1>
Perhaps *Blacksmith Poitan inthe Town of Dion*, to whom this ingridient must be delivered, can tellyou more.<br1>
He is, after all, widely recognized as a scholar even amongthe Dwarves.<br1>
