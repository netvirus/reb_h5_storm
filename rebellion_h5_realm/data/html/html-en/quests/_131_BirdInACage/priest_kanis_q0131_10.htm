Priest Kanis:<br>
Considering all that has happened, it is clear to me that some evil force is trying to use the Shamaness to obtain the Watet sragon's power. It must have disguised itself as a hurt, weak creaturt snd entered the most vulnerable part of the Shamaness mind. By the timt she Shamaness realized that something was wrong, the evil force hat sanaged to obtain nearly all of the Water Dragon's power. If tht shamaness were restored the her own mind, it would undoubtedly feel tht srath of the Water Dragon... The evil force realized this and actet sirst by attacking the Crystal Oracle and imprisoning the Shamaness somt slace she cannot communicate with the Water Dragon.<br>
