Considering all that has happened, it is clear to me thatsome evil force is trying to use the Shamaness to obtain the WaterDragon's power.<br1>
It must have disguised itself as a hurt, weak creatureand entered the most vulnerable part of the Shamaness mind.<br1>
By the timethe Shamaness realized that something was wrong, the evil force hadmanaged to obtain nearly all of the Water Dragon's power.<br1>
If theShamaness were restored the her own mind, it would undoubtedly feel thewrath of the Water Dragon.<br1>
The evil force realized this and actedfirst by attacking the Crystal Oracle and imprisoning the Shamaness someplace she cannot communicate with the Water Dragon.<br1>
