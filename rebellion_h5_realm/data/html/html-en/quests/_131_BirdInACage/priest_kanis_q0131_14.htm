To enter the *Water Dragon's Cave*, you will need 1Contaminated Crystal.<br1>
The Contaminated Crystal can be found at the *DarkCloud Mansion*.<br1>
They say that a monster named *Baylor* rules over the*Water Dragon's Cave*.<br1>
I believe that Baylor guards the place where theShamaness is being held captive.<br1>
If that is the case, you will only beable reach the Shamaness is being defeating Baylor.<br1>
That creature issaid to be far stronger and more frightening than ordinary monsters, soplease be careful.<br1>
