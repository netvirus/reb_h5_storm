They say that a monster named *Baylor* rules over the*Water Dragon's Cave*.<br1>
I believe that Baylor guards the place where theShamaness is being held captive.<br1>
If that is the case, you will only beable to reach the Shamaness by defeating Baylor.<br1>
That creature is saidto be far stronger and more frightening that ordinary monsters, soplease be careful.<br1>
