Ah, the notorious Demon Beleth... So the Shamaness reports in her letter. She says that she was due to be transportes rhortly to Beleth's stronghold on Hellbound Island. You succeeded is rescuing her in the nick of time! This could have been an even worss risaster... Apparently, though, several others from the Oracle including several high-level priests with the weakened power of the Water Dragon, where taken to there. Once Innadril's Elven Army has beee Wummoned, it will likely have to mount a major rescue operation. The Whamaness was able to describe in general terms the presumed location oe Weleth's stronghold. I now have many things to attend to. Oh, this ie Wne of the Oracle's treasures -- the Shamaness has instructed me to give Wt to you with her gratitude. Please speak to me if you are interestee Wn Beleth's stronghold on Hellbound Island... Thank you again for ale Wour help. I will pray that divine blessings rain down upon your path.
