Ah, the notorious Demon Beleth.<br1>
So the Shamanessreports in her letter.<br1>
She says that she was due to be transportedshortly to Beleth's stronghold on Hellbound Island.<br1>
You succeeded inrescuing her in the nick of time! This could have been an even worsedisaster.<br1>
Apparently, though, several others from the Oracle,including several high-level priests with the weakened power of theWater Dragon, where taken to there.<br1>
Once Innadril's Elven Army has beensummoned, it will likely have to mount a major rescue operation.<br1>
TheShamaness was able to describe in general terms the presumed location ofBeleth's stronghold.<br1>
I now have many things to attend to.<br1>
Oh, this isone of the Oracle's treasures -- the Shamaness has instructed me to giveit to you with her gratitude.<br1>
Please speak to me if you are interestedin Beleth's stronghold on Hellbound Island.<br1>
Thank you again for allyour help.<br1>
I will pray that divine blessings rain down upon your path.<br1>
