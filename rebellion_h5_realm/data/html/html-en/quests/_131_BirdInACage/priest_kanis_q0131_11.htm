<font color="FF8000">Priest Kanis:</font><br>
I was able to determine the Shamaness location by using arelic of Eva that contains the power of the Water Dragon.<br1>
.<br1>
Take thisEcho Crystal for now.<br1>
When I confirmed her location through the relic, Iwas also able to ascertain a little about her condition.<br1>
It seems thather mind has been sealed in order to block her from communication withthe Water Dragon.<br1>
When you find her, you may need this Echo Crystal,which contains the voice of her mother, also a famous priestess.<br1>
