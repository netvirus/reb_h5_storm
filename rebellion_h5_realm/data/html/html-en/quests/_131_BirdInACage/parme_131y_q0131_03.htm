(As she listens, the Shamanesscontinues to tenderly hold her head in her hands) Uhh.<br1>
Uhh.<br1>
.<br1>
Ahh! I remember everything now.<br1>
Thank you very much.<br1>
There is so much totell, but.<br1>
It would be best to leave this place first.<br1>
I will go to asecret location to take care of a number of tasks for the Water Dragonthat cannot be delayed.<br1>
I am sorry to not be able to tell you more, evenafter you saved me.<br1>
But it is that important.<br1>
I will teleport yououtside.<br1>
