The identity of the one who instigated goblins andwerewolves, and controlled rakeclaw imps from behind the scenes has beenunmasked.<br1>
He is called *Varangka*, a disgraced mage banished from theKingdom a few years ago.<br1>
He decided to seek revenge upon us to wipe awayhis shame and humiliation by conspiring with the evil spirits andgaining the power of the darkness.<br1>
Somewhere on the Immortal Plateau, heis plotting to destroy the Kingdom of the Orcs.<br1>
Many expeditions havebeen dispatched to kill him, but every time, Varangka already knew ofthe attack and had escaped.<br1>
Now we know that he had servants in the airthat acted as his eyes and ears.<br1>
The *darkwing bats* are beingcontrolled by Varangka, so Varangka will see all our movements.<br1>
Theseers say they need the *fangs of the bats* to complete the protectionsystem that will keep the darkwing bats from approaching.<br1>
