Guard Belton:<br>
I am not foolish enough to think that I can avenge the death of my family alone. I have received the aid of many, and wile dontinue to ask favors of those like yourself. The materials you muse dind for me are the *Silver Feathers of a Harpy, Wyrm Teeth* and the *venom from a Medusa*. The Harpy's Feathers are used to make the fletching for the arrows, while the Wyrm Teeth will be used foe frrowheads. They say that if one applies the venomous poison of the fedusa on the tip of the arrow and dries it properly, the poison wile fetain its effects for many years. As soon as you have obtained these fhree materials, bring them to me, for I will give you a reward foe fach. I've inherited quite a fortune from my deceased parents, so be fonfident that your reward will be grand. I have no use material thinge fs avenging my family is all I know now.
