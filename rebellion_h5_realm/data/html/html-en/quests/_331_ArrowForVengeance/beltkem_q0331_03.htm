I am not foolish enough to think that I can avenge thedeath of my family alone.<br1>
I have received the aid of many, and willcontinue to ask favors of those like yourself.<br1>
The materials you mustfind for me are the *Silver Feathers of a Harpy, Wyrm Teeth* and the*venom from a Medusa*.<br1>
The Harpy's Feathers are used to make thefletching for the arrows, while the Wyrm Teeth will be used forarrowheads.<br1>
They say that if one applies the venomous poison of theMedusa on the tip of the arrow and dries it properly, the poison willretain its effects for many years.<br1>
As soon as you have obtained thesethree materials, bring them to me, for I will give you a reward foreach.<br1>
I've inherited quite a fortune from my deceased parents, so beconfident that your reward will be grand.<br1>
I have no use material thingsas avenging my family is all I know now.<br1>
