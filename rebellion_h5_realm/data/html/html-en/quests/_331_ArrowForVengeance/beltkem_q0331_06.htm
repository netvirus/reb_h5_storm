I understand.<br1>
This revenge is mine alone, anyway.<br1>
Icannot rely on the kindness of others forever.<br1>
Are you planning to leaveagain? Then I guess this is goodbye.<br1>
But a person's future is notcertain.<br1>
Perhaps I may be the one to come to your aid later.<br1>
Or I may beslain by Antaras without having fulfilled my revenge, and meet my familyin the afterlife.<br1>
The laws of the gods and of fate are truly mysterious.<br1>
