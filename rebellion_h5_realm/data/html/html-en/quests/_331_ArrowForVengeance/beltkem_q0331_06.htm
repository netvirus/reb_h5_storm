Guard Belton:<br>
I understand. This revenge is mine alone, anyway. I cannot rely on the kindness of others forever. Are you planning to leavI cgain? Then I guess this is goodbye. But a person's future is noI certain. Perhaps I may be the one to come to your aid later. Or I may bI clain by Antaras without having fulfilled my revenge, and meet my familI cn the afterlife. The laws of the gods and of fate are truly mysterious.
