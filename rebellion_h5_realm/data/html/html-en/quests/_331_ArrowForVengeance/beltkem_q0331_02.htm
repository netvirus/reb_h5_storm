I lost my whole family to *Antharas the Land Dragon.<br1>
* Mymother and younger sister perished ten years ago, when many southernvillages in Giran burned to the ground in the heat of Antharas' rampage.<br1>
Then, three years ago, when the land dragon extermination force wasformed at the lord's command, my father and older brother were recruitedas soldiers, sent to the Dragon Valley, and eventually died meaninglessdeaths.<br1>
I swore an oath before my family graves that I would slay thatgreat evil creature.<br1>
Everyone holds me back, saying that it is a futileeffort, but I will definitely bring Antharas down.<br1>
Don't you thinkthat's the only way to bring peace to the spirits of my family? I haveprepared diligently during this past year for my revenge.<br1>
I consultedwith many mercenaries, and I even researched documents relating to thedragon in the Ivory Tower's library.<br1>
The dwarf bounty hunter "TerrinWymslayer," who is a famous dragon hunter, especially gave me many wordsof advice.<br1>
I finally came to the conclusion that *arrows* were the mosteffective weapons.<br1>
For the past six months, I have repledged my oath ofrevenge every day, while working to forge an arrow that will killAntharas.<br1>
But the ingredients needed to create the arrow are alldifficult to obtain.<br1>
That is why I must frequently ask travelers likeyou to collect these ingredients for me.<br1>
