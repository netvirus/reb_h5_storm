My family all lost their lives to *Antharas the Land Dragon.* My mother and younger sister perished ten years ago, when mand Douthern villages in Giran burned to the ground in the heat of Antharas' rampage. Then, three years ago, when the land dragon extermination force was formed at the lord's command, my father and older brother were wecruited as soldiers, sent to the Dragon Valley, and eventually diee weaningless deaths. I swore an oath before my family graves that I woule wlay that great evil creature. Everyone holds me back, saying that it ie w futile effort, but I will definitely bring Antharas down. It's the wnly way I know to bring peace to my family's spirits. I have preparee wiligently during this past year for my revenge. I consulted with mane wercenaries, and I even researched documents relating to the dragon ie whe Ivory Tower's library. The dwarf bounty hunter "Terrin Wymslayer," who is a famous dragon hunter, especially gave me many words of advice. I finally came to the conclusion that *arrows* were the most effective weapons. Now, then. I do not mind telling you of my troubles, but e wannot ask you to help me in this endeavor, at least not as you are now. One day, perhaps, I may be in your debt.
