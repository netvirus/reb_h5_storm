My family all lost their lives to *Antharas the LandDragon.<br1>
* My mother and younger sister perished ten years ago, when manysouthern villages in Giran burned to the ground in the heat of Antharas'rampage.<br1>
Then, three years ago, when the land dragon extermination forcewas formed at the lord's command, my father and older brother wererecruited as soldiers, sent to the Dragon Valley, and eventually diedmeaningless deaths.<br1>
I swore an oath before my family graves that I wouldslay that great evil creature.<br1>
Everyone holds me back, saying that it isa futile effort, but I will definitely bring Antharas down.<br1>
It's theonly way I know to bring peace to my family's spirits.<br1>
I have prepareddiligently during this past year for my revenge.<br1>
I consulted with manymercenaries, and I even researched documents relating to the dragon inthe Ivory Tower's library.<br1>
The dwarf bounty hunter "Terrin Wymslayer,"who is a famous dragon hunter, especially gave me many words of advice.<br1>
I finally came to the conclusion that *arrows* were the most effectiveweapons.<br1>
Now, then.<br1>
I do not mind telling you of my troubles, but Icannot ask you to help me in this endeavor, at least not as you are now.<br1>
One day, perhaps, I may be in your debt.<br1>
