<font color="FF8000">Guard Belton:</font><br>
I'm feeling an exceptionally strong longing for my familytoday.<br1>
But I cannot risk falling into my fancies and having mydetermination shaken or my will for revenge weakened.<br1>
Every day as Imake arrows, sharpen the teeth of the worms, and put feathers on myarrows, I think of my dead family.<br1>
And as I apply the poison of themedusa on the end of the arrowhead, I curse Antaras.<br1>
Now, shall we takea look at the materials you have brought? Good.<br1>
This should be enoughmaterial to make arrows for a few days.<br1>
As promised, I will reward youaccording to the number of materials you have brought me.<br1>
