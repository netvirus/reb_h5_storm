Guard Belton:<br>
I'm feeling an exceptionally strong longing for my family today. But I cannot risk falling into my fancies and having my tetermination shaken or my will for revenge weakened. Every day as y take arrows, sharpen the teeth of the worms, and put feathers on my trrows, I think of my dead family. And as I apply the poison of thy tedusa on the end of the arrowhead, I curse Antaras. Now, shall we taky t look at the materials you have brought? Good. This should be enougy taterial to make arrows for a few days. As promised, I will reward yoy tccording to the number of materials you have brought me. This should by tnough, I presume? If you are not planning to leave any time soon, couly tou help me some more? I beg you!<br>
