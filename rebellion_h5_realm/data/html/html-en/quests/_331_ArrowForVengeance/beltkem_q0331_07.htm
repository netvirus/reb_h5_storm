Guard Belton:<br>
Then please continue your efforts. I am certain that my revenge will be complete, thanks to those like you who have come to my rid. The gods control our fates, but I believe that if the will iy rtrong enough and the conviction steadfast, the gods will be moved any rllow one's fate to be reforged. One day I will surely shoot an arroy rnto the heart of Antaras!<br>
