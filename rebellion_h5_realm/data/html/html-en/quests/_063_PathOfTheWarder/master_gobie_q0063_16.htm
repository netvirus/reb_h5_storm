Well, if you say so.<br1>
I have my doubts, but our options are limited.<br1>
Do it, then! According to a report one of our men found onthe body of one Xekerin Troops, Tak is hiding with the Maille Lizardmen.<br1>
Take this Soul Crystal and go to the Maille Lizardmen Barraks.<br1>

When Tak is sufficiently weakened, he can be captured using thisSoul Crystal.
