<font color="36DC25">Master Sione:</font><br>
While you were still training on the Isle of Souls, I was sent to the outer world to collect information.<br1>
Compared to our male counterparts, we female Kamael engage in more subtle and skillful combat.<br1>
I see that you have gained a bit of combat experience. If you wish to rise to the next level, come and prove to me that you can control your combat skills.<br>
