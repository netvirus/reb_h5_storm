<font color="36DC25">Master Gobie:</font><br>
Speak up! Captain Bathis must have treated you with contempt, eh?<br1>
A good lesson for you, is that not all the races in this Outer World see us the same way.<br1>
Some respect us as equals, others see us simply as sword fodder in battle.<br1>
>Even individuals within a race treat us differently...<br1>
As newcomers to the mainland, we dare not risk offending any of these races now.<br1>
In fact, our orders are to provide assistance to each of them impartially.<br1>
So, we must learn to govern our tempers...<br>
