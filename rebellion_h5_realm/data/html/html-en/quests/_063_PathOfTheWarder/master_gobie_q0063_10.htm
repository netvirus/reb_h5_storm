Ah! You have returned.<br1>
And i see this has been another eventful errand.<br1>
I too have been confused when dealing with some ofthese other races.<br1>
The races of the Outer World and the evil creatures have complicated relations.<br1>
Still, as an intelligence officer, it is my task to make sense of all this conflicting information.<br1>
As you wrotein you report, we do not know whether the races of the Outer World and the evil creatures communicate secretly or use each other to gain thier ends.<br1>
Certaintly, the relations between them are complicated and often bloody.<br1>
