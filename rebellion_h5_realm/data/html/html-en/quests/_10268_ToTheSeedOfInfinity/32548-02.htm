<font color="36DC25"><html><body>	Keucereus:</font><br>
<br> The Seed of Infinity, located to the north of my Alliance	Base, is a land of death governed by	<font color="LEVEL">Ekimus</font>, the Lord of the Dead and a devout	follower of Shilen.<br1>
<br> It is inhabited by the undead.<br1>
The surrounding land has also	been contaminated, so the only safe way to approach it is by air,	either in a	<font color="LEVEL">clan airship</font> or via	<font color="LEVEL">transformation magic</font>.<br1>
<br> Heed my advice: many of the dangers here will exceed the	individual skills of even the strongest adventurer.<br1>
If at all possible,	you should only venture there in the company of a powerful party.<br1>
<br> Do you understand?	<br>	<a action="bypass -h Quest _10268_ToTheSeedOfInfinity 32548-04.<br1>
