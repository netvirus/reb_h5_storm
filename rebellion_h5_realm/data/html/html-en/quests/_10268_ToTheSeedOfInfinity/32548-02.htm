	<br> The Seed of Infinity, located to the north of my Alliance<br>
	Base, is a land of death governed by<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Ekimus</font>, the Lord of the Dead and a devout<br>
	follower of Shilen.<br>
	<br> It is inhabited by the undead. The surrounding land has also<br>
	been contaminated, so the only safe way to approach it is by air,<br>
	either in a<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">clan airship</font> or via<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">transformation magic</font>.<br>
	<br> Heed my advice:<br>
many of the dangers here will exceed the<br>
	individual skills of even the strongest adventurer. If at all possible,<br>
	you should only venture there in the company of a powerful party.<br>
	<br> Do you understand?<br>
