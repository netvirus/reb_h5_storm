	<br> Take this<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">letter of introduction</font>, which authorizes you<br>
	to engage in action within the Seed of Infinity. It is a dangerous<br>
	region, but this letter says that an adventurer like you can be trusted<br>
	to carry out missions there.<br>
	<br> Deliver this letter to<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Officer Tepios</font> inside the Seed of Infinity<br>
	and he will understand why I have recommended you.<br>
	<br> Be advised that first you must be<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">teleported inside the Seed of Infinity by a<br>
		person called Jaedin</font>, who you will find at the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Seed of Infinity Dock</font>.<br>
	<br> You must also first acquire a<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Flying Transformed Object</font> in order to<br>
	venture into the skies of Gracia. You may obtain one by completing a<br>
	simple mission assigned by<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Engineer Lekon</font>, a Dwarf located south of<br>
	here. Alternately, you can purchase a Transformation Scroll from<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Officer Tolonis</font> in the same place. Farewell<br>
	and good luck!<br>
