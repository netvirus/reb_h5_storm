<br> Take this	<font color="LEVEL">letter of introduction</font>, which authorizes you	to engage in action within the Seed of Infinity.<br1>
It is a dangerous	region, but this letter says that an adventurer like you can be trusted	to carry out missions there.<br1>
<br> Deliver this letter to	<font color="LEVEL">Officer Tepios</font> inside the Seed of Infinity	and he will understand why I have recommended you.<br1>
<br> Be advised that first you must be	<font color="LEVEL">teleported inside the Seed of Infinity by a		person called Jaedin</font>, who you will find at the	<font color="LEVEL">Seed of Infinity Dock</font>.<br1>
<br> You must also first acquire a	<font color="LEVEL">Flying Transformed Object</font> in order to	venture into the skies of Gracia.<br1>
You may obtain one by completing a	simple mission assigned by	<font color="LEVEL">Engineer Lekon</font>, a Dwarf located south of	here.<br1>
Alternately, you can purchase a Transformation Scroll from	<font color="LEVEL">Officer Tolonis</font> in the same place.<br1>
