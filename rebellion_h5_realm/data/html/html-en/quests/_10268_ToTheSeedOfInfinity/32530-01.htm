<br> This letter of recommendation must be from Admiral Keucereus.<br1>
We've been waiting for some capable adventurers! We will, of course,	reward you for your efforts.<br1>
It may not be as much as we would like,	but know that when we have regained our land, you will always be	welcomed here with honor.<br1>
<br> Well, I see that you have proven your ability to destroy the	creatures inside the Death Gate.<br1>
<br> Tell me when you're ready for another mission.<br1>
I have just	the thing for you.<br1>
