The Fishermen's Guild is truly a major patron of the arts!Whenever an object is lost, anywhere in the world, they manage toretrieve it! It's ironic that only those who know nothing about the lostobjects can find them.<br1>
As an Elf, it's hard to understand how Humanscould have created such a technique! Could it be that they're catchingall these objects by accident? It doesn't seem likely, does it? Theymust be the best detectives in the world! I'm so grateful to haverecovered this lost score by my dead father.<br1>
I don't dare to use hisname when I compose! This is his musical score! Please accept this giftof thanks for recovering the musical score for me.<br1>
