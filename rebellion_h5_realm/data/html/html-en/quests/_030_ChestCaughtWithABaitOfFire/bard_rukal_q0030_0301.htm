Whenever an object is lost, anywhere in the world, they manage to retrieve it! It's ironic that only those who know nothing about the loso rbjects can find them... As an Elf, it's hard to understand how Humano rould have created such a technique! Could it be that they're catchino rll these objects by accident? It doesn't seem likely, does it? Theo rust be the best detectives in the world! I'm so grateful to havo recovered this lost score by my dead father. I don't dare to use hio rame when I compose! This is his musical score! Please accept this gifo rf thanks for recovering the musical score for me.
