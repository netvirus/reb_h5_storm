I think this is my client's *redtreasure box*.<br1>
It contains the musical score that Mr.<br1>
Rukal was lookingfor.<br1>
It has his name listed as the composer and lyricist.<br1>
If it isanything like his other works, it's wonderfully powerful music! Take itto Mr.<br1>
Rukal in Dion Castle Town.<br1>
