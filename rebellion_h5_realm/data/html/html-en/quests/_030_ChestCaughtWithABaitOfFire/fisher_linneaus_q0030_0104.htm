There are some things moreinteresting than fish! A while back, someone came around looking for a*red treasure box*.<br1>
Honestly, the bait I gave you earlier was designedto find it! Don't look at me like that! It wouldn't have worked if youwould've known what the bait was for! So, did you find it? I'll tell youwho my client is when you bring me the *red treasure box*.<br1>
You mustbring it to me unopened.<br1>
Use the *bait of flame* to find it.<br1>
Remember,your fishing skill must be level 20.<br1>
Someone may already have found it,so ask around in the market first.<br1>
