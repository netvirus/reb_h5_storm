The Black Anvil Guild has watched youclosely for a long time.<br1>
We paid particular attention when you passedthe cruel test of the three blacksmiths and were proclaimed an Artisan,and when you made seven Journeyman Rings and passed the guild's trial.<br1>
We've determined that you're a splendid Dwarf, with exceptional guts andacumen! I'd really like to offer you the chance to become a* Maestro*,the ultimate artisan, but you don't have enough experience yet.<br1>
