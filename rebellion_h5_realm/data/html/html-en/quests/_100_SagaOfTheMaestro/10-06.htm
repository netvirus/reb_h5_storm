<font color="36DC25">!Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
As you hold the Stone of Commune and concentrate onit, the tablet gets surrounded by bright light.<br1>
You hear several hundredpeople simultaneously reading scriptures, and new knowledge starts toenter your mind.<br1>
On one hand, you feel like you understand everything.<br1>
On the other hand, you feel that you don't understand anything.<br1>
Youhear someone's low-pitched laughter.<br1>
And you hear a man's voice.<br1>
"Younow have one more successor that you like.<br1>
" A blonde woman replies.<br1>
"No, he's like a baby who just started walking.<br1>
But he will no longerneed his mother's protection.<br1>
" All images disappear, and you startto recognize the surrounding environment.<br1>
You are starting to understandthe knowledge you have gained from the tablet little by little.<br1>
Thepilgrimage of the tablet seems to have ended.<br1>
