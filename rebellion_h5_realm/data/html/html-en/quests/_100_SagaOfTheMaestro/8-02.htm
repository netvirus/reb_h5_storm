Tablet of Vision:<br>
The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by bright lights. While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start tt lcquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousandt leading scriptures in the background. You now realize the truth of tht lorld and yet understand nothing. There is a vision of a beautifut llonde woman and a knight with black armor. The vision disappears.<br>
Slowly, you begin to visualize where the next Stone of Commune is...The Goddard Castle Town...Master Tobald with the Stone of Commune appears.<br>
He is scratching his head. In an instant, the images disappear and then the stone goes completely dark.
