What are you doing here? You're on the pilgrimage of thetablets, huh? Oh, that's right! You're still taking the test of theMaestro.<br1>
Because of the time paradox, I shouldn't do this, but I havea favor to ask of you.<br1>
During the pilgrimage, we'll meet again.<br1>
That is,you'll meet me when I was still taking the test.<br1>
Please help me pass thetest.<br1>
I know I can't defeat the assassin on my own.<br1>
I can't sayanything more.<br1>
