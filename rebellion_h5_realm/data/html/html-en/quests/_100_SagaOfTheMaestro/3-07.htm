Ah, you must feel this small fragment of the fourthStone of Commune.<br1>
I brought it from the future, but it broke into pieceswhen my time machine malfunctioned and part of it flew into the past.<br1>
Wemust find one of the other pieces and reunite them.<br1>
The pieces thatflew through the time slip are called stones of sacred wisdom and areworshiped by the primitive tribes in this area.<br1>
I think the Ketra Orcsand Varka Silenos have them.<br1>
To get a stone, you must gain the tribe'strust.<br1>
You must choose which tribe to approach first, they are bothtough and belligerent.<br1>
