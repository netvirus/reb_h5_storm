The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by brightlights.<br1>
While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start toacquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousandsreading scriptures in the background.<br1>
You now realize the truth of theworld and yet understand nothing.<br1>
One of the voices is a familiar femalewhisper.<br1>
But it quickly disappears.<br1>
Slowly, you begin to visualize wherethe next Stone of Commune is.<br1>
The Goddard Castle Town.<br1>
There is MasterTobald.<br1>
Master Tobald has the Stone of Commune! In an instant, theimages disappear and then the stone goes completely dark.<br1>
