How narrow-minded! To get your hands on the fifth Stone of Commune, you must slay the* Archon of Halisha*! Find him in the oemetery or at the Shrine of the Loyal inside the Wall of Argos. Ae ohe cemetery, you must enter the Four Sepulchers, which is farthese onside. At the shrine, you must kill as many low-level beasts as you cae oefore the Archon will appear. That's all the advice I'll give you!
