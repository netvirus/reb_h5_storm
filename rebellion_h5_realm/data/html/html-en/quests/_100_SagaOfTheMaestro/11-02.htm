How narrow-minded! To get your hands on the fifth Stoneof Commune, you must slay the* Archon of Halisha*! Find him in thecemetery or at the Shrine of the Loyal inside the Wall of Argos.<br1>
Atthe cemetery, you must enter the Four Sepulchers, which is farthestinside.<br1>
At the shrine, you must kill as many low-level beasts as you canbefore the Archon will appear.<br1>
