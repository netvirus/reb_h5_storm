<font color="36DC25">!Chief Golem Craftsman Telson:</font><br>
He's probably in* Goddard Castle Town* bynow.<br1>
He, like his brother, tends to show up and disappear suddenly! So,I'm not quite sure.<br1>
Yesterday he came running up to me and droppedthis off.<br1>
He asked me to give it to you.<br1>
I skimmed through it, and itseems to be a report about a spirit that protects one of the sixtablets.<br1>
You should read it, since you'll have to face it eventually.<br1>
