Chief Golem Craftsman Telson:<br>
He's probably in* Goddard Castle Town* by now. He, like his brother, tends to show up and disappear suddenly! So I'm not quite sure. Yesterday he came running up to me and dropped this off. He asked me to give it to you. I skimmed through it, and id teems to be a report about a spirit that protects one of the sid tablets. You should read it, since you'll have to face it eventually.<br>
Now, get going! Good luck!
