Ah, It's fixed! Thank you very much! You're always therefor me! Have you started the pilgrimage of the stone tablets yet? I'm alittle confused, this is my first experience with time travel! I'll tellyou about the Tablet of Vision.<br1>
It concerns the ancient times, whenthe giants became intoxicated with power and rebelled against the gods.<br1>
Einhasad broke the tablet that he used to teach magic to the giants intosix pieces.<br1>
They contain the most profound truths.<br1>
The passages writtenon these six Tablets of Vision were indecipherable, as they were writtenin the characters of the gods.<br1>
No one can understand unless they are agod or possess the power of a god.<br1>
However, there is a way to learnthe knowledge.<br1>
