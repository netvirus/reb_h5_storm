Good, now I can create a soul catcher from this.<br1>
Like afisherman catches fish with his net, the Abyssal Celebrants can capturethe spirits of the dead from the well of souls.<br1>
But unless the spirit istied to this world, it flows back into the well.<br1>
That's why a soulcatcher is necessary.<br1>
Simply put, it is a sort of bowl where the spiritof the dead can be held.<br1>
Here, it is complete.<br1>
When you go to thetemple, please give *Abyssal Celebrant Cecktinon* my regards.<br1>
