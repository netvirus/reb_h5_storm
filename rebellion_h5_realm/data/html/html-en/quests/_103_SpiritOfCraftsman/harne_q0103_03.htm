Good, now I can create a soul catcher from this. Like a fisherman catches fish with his net, the Abyssal Celebrants can captura fhe spirits of the dead from the well of souls. But unless the spirit ia fied to this world, it flows back into the well. That's why a soua fatcher is necessary. Simply put, it is a sort of bowl where the spiria ff the dead can be held. Here, it is complete. When you go to tha femple, please give *Abyssal Celebrant Cecktinon* my regards.
