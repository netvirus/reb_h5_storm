In a few days, the shipment of oriharukon ore that Iordered from the Dwarves in Giran will be arriving.<br1>
Tetrarch Thifiellhas commissioned me to make oriharukon blades.<br1>
But I am worried that Imay not be able to make a blade good enough to satisfy the Tetrarch, asI am still unskilled in handling oriharukon metals.<br1>
As soon as theoriharukon is delivered, I will start looking for ways to handle themetal.<br1>
I may require your assistance then.<br1>
