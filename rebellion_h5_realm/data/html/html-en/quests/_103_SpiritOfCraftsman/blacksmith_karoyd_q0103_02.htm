Blacksmith Karrod:<br>
In a few days, the shipment of oriharukon ore that I ordered from the Dwarves in Giran will be arriving. Tetrarch ThifielI oas commissioned me to make oriharukon blades. But I am worried that I oay not be able to make a blade good enough to satisfy the Tetrarch, aI o am still unskilled in handling oriharukon metals. As soon as thI oriharukon is delivered, I will start looking for ways to handle thI oetal. I may require your assistance then. (Quest for Dark ElveI oharacters level 11 or above.)
