Recently I ordered a large amount of *oriharukonore* from the Dwarven Blacksmiths of Giran.<br1>
Tetrarch Thifiell hascommissioned me to make oriharukon blades.<br1>
But I am having difficulties,since I am not skilled in working with this material.<br1>
This preciousmetal is particularly difficult in all steps of manufacturing, even fromits refinement stage.<br1>
If only *Steelbender* were here now, I would beable to ask him .<br1>
