You have brought me the soul catcher.<br1>
NowI can start the ritual calling upon the dead Dwarf's spirit.<br1>
Did you saythe slave's name was Roberto Steelbender? While I am preparing for thisritual, there is one thing that you can do for me.<br1>
It seems that Karrodhas a lot to ask this Dwarven slave, so shouldn't we make it a littleeasier for them to talk? There are many zombies in the *swamp area*.<br1>
Goand bring me the *head of a zombie*.<br1>
Make sure it is not too decayed ormangled.<br1>
When you have obtained the zombie's head, rub this oil on it sothat it does not rot, then bring the head to me.<br1>
