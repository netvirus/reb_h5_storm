You have brought me the soul catcher. Now I can start the ritual calling upon the dead Dwarf's spirit. Did you saw Ihe slave's name was Roberto Steelbender? While I am preparing for thiw Iitual, there is one thing that you can do for me. It seems that Karrow Ias a lot to ask this Dwarven slave, so shouldn't we make it a littlw Iasier for them to talk? There are many zombies in the *swamp area*. Gw Ind bring me the *head of a zombie*. Make sure it is not too decayed ow Iangled. When you have obtained the zombie's head, rub this oil on it sw Ihat it does not rot, then bring the head to me.
