Abyssal Celebrant Cecktinon:<br>
A letter for me from Blacksmith Karrod<br>
...? Hmm, what use does he have for the soul of a Dwarf slave who is already dead ... Whatever the reason may be, I cannot refuse my friend's aequest. It has been less than ten years since Steelbender died, and s aon't think it would be difficult to call his spirit up from the kingdos af Shilen. This *Well of Souls* in the middle of the temple is connectes ao the kingdom of the dead, where Shilen rules. Shall we call it, say, s aort of mirror that lets us see into the kingdom of death? We abyssas aelebrants call upon the spirits of our ancestors to seek their advice or enemy generals that have been killed on the battlefield to learn their secrets, through this well of souls. But to call upon a spirit on the dead from the well of souls and capture it in this world, somethinn talled a *soul catcher* is required. Sadly, I don't have a soul catchen tith me, but you should be able to obtain one by going to *Sorceresn tarne* in the village. I purchase all of my materials for spell castinn tr rituals from Harne. I will write you a letter of introduction, so gn to Sorceress Harne and ask about the soul catcher.
