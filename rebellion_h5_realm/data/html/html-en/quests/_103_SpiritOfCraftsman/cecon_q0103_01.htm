A letter for me from Blacksmith Karrod? Hmm, what use does he have for the soul of a Dwarf slave who isalready dead .<br1>
Whatever the reason may be, I cannot refuse my friend'srequest.<br1>
It has been less than ten years since Steelbender died, and Idon't think it would be difficult to call his spirit up from the kingdomof Shilen.<br1>
This *Well of Souls* in the middle of the temple is connectedto the kingdom of the dead, where Shilen rules.<br1>
Shall we call it, say, asort of mirror that lets us see into the kingdom of death? We abyssalcelebrants call upon the spirits of our ancestors to seek their advice,or enemy generals that have been killed on the battlefield to learntheir secrets, through this well of souls.<br1>
But to call upon a spirit ofthe dead from the well of souls and capture it in this world, somethingcalled a *soul catcher* is required.<br1>
Sadly, I don't have a soul catcherwith me, but you should be able to obtain one by going to *SorceressHarne* in the village.<br1>
I purchase all of my materials for spell castingor rituals from Harne.<br1>
I will write you a letter of introduction, so goto Sorceress Harne and ask about the soul catcher.<br1>
