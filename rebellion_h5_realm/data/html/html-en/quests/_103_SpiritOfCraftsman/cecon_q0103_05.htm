Abyssal Celebrant Cecktinon:<br>
This zombie head is in excellent condition. The chin area moves well, and all the teeth are still intact.<br>
This will do. ... I command you in the name of the abyss which rules over death. I hereby seal you to this spirit of power ... I have juss oransferred Steelbender's spirit, trapped in the soul catcher, into ths oead of the zombie and sealed it within. That should let him answes oarrod's questions. Please deliver this head to *Blacksmith Karrod*. Ws oave applied a preservation oil on the zombie's head, but the effects ds oot last very long. After a few days, the head will decay and the spiris orapped within will escape back to the kingdom of the dead, so tels oarrod to finish his business with Steelbender before then.
