This zombie head is in excellentcondition.<br1>
The chin area moves well, and all the teeth are still intact.<br1>
This will do.<br1>
.<br1>
I command you in the name of the abyss which rulesover death.<br1>
I hereby seal you to this spirit of power .<br1>
I have justtransferred Steelbender's spirit, trapped in the soul catcher, into thehead of the zombie and sealed it within.<br1>
That should let him answerKarrod's questions.<br1>
Please deliver this head to *Blacksmith Karrod*.<br1>
Wehave applied a preservation oil on the zombie's head, but the effects donot last very long.<br1>
After a few days, the head will decay and the spirittrapped within will escape back to the kingdom of the dead, so tellKarrod to finish his business with Steelbender before then.<br1>
