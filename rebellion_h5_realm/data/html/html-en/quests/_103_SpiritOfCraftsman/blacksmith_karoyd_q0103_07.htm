Steelbender's spirit is contained in this head? Isee that Abyssal Celebrant Cecktinon went to great lengths for this.<br1>
Sonow I can receive personal lessons from Steelbender about the refiningof oriharukon.<br1>
You've done well, my friend.<br1>
For helping me out, I willgive this sword to you.<br1>
It may sound like I am boasting, but it's a veryuseful weapon.<br1>
Put it to good use.<br1>
Now, shall we start .<br1>
Hey,Steelbender! What has it been, a decade now? Different head, but thatdumb expression is still the same.<br1>
Let's keep our welcomes short .<br1>
I've got a lot to ask you .<br1>
