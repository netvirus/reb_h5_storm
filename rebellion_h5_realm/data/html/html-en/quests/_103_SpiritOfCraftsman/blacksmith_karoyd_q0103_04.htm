Roberto Steelbender .<br1>
He was a Dwarven Warsmiththat was enslaved by we Dark Elves for nearly a century.<br1>
Warsmith is aDwarven title given to the most elite Dwarven Blacksmiths.<br1>
I learned myskills from that slave Blacksmith.<br1>
For decades, I worked hard under hisdirection, but there was always a limit to what I could do.<br1>
No matterhow closely I followed his instructions, the weapons and shields I madewere always missing something, and always a bit dull.<br1>
Then I found outthat Steelbender had only taught me basic knowledge and hidden the mostimportant skills from me -- he said that those skills were only passedon to the Dwarves and that he couldn't teach me .<br1>
I put him on atorture device and extracted those skills from him after 15 days oftorture.<br1>
Sadly, he couldn't stand the pain and died, but not before Ifound out the methods for manipulating mithril, adamantite and damascusmetals.<br1>
This time around, I plan to call upon the *spirit ofSteelbender* and ask him about the refinement process of oriharukon.<br1>
Todo that, I am going to have to ask the Abyssal Celebrants of Shilen forexorcism rituals and prepare various materials.<br1>
