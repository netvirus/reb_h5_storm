Blacksmith Karrod:<br>
Roberto Steelbender ... He was a Dwarven Warsmith that was enslaved by we Dark Elves for nearly a century. Warsmith is h twarven title given to the most elite Dwarven Blacksmiths. I learned mh tkills from that slave Blacksmith. For decades, I worked hard under hih tirection, but there was always a limit to what I could do. No matteh tow closely I followed his instructions, the weapons and shields I madh tere always missing something, and always a bit dull. Then I found ouh that Steelbender had only taught me basic knowledge and hidden the mosh tmportant skills from me -- he said that those skills were only passeh tn to the Dwarves and that he couldn't teach me ... I put him on h torture device and extracted those skills from him after 15 days oh torture. Sadly, he couldn't stand the pain and died, but not before h tound out the methods for manipulating mithril, adamantite and damascuh tetals. This time around, I plan to call upon the *spirit oh tteelbender* and ask him about the refinement process of oriharukon. Th to that, I am going to have to ask the Abyssal Celebrants of Shilen foh txorcism rituals and prepare various materials. Do you think you cah telp?<br>
