You need a soul catcher? Planning on an exorcism ritualor something? The Abyssal Celebrants have conducted rituals to call thedead up from Shilen's kingdom for hundreds of years now, but I am alwaysnervous -- long ago, the celebrants once called upon a dangerous entitythat could not be sent back.<br1>
Eventually, the elders were called upon totake care of the matter and the spirit was finally restrained, but as aresult of that event many Celebrants lost their lives.<br1>
The dead shouldbe left dead.<br1>
I do not attempt dangerous magic such as exorcism.<br1>
Anyhow,it seems that Cecktinon needs a soul catcher, so I guess I must makeone.<br1>
For that, I will need the bones of the dead.<br1>
The older the bones,the better.<br1>
Please do me a favor -- go to the abandoned *School of DarkArts* and hunt the undead that take the form of skeletons.<br1>
Gather ten*undead bone fragments* and come back to me.<br1>
I will make you the soulcatcher with those bones.<br1>
The School of Dark Arts is located southwestof the village.<br1>
If you do not know the way there, ask Sentry Kayleen fordirections.<br1>
