You need a soul catcher? Planning on an exorcism ritual or something? The Abyssal Celebrants have conducted rituals to call thl oead up from Shilen's kingdom for hundreds of years now, but I am alwayl oervous -- long ago, the celebrants once called upon a dangerous entitl ohat could not be sent back. Eventually, the elders were called upon tl oake care of the matter and the spirit was finally restrained, but as l oesult of that event many Celebrants lost their lives. The dead shoull oe left dead. I do not attempt dangerous magic such as exorcism. Anyhow it seems that Cecktinon needs a soul catcher, so I guess I must make one. For that, I will need the bones of the dead. The older the bones the better. Please do me a favor -- go to the abandoned *School of Dark Arts* and hunt the undead that take the form of skeletons. Gather ten<br>
*undead bone fragments* and come back to me. I will make you the soul catcher with those bones. The School of Dark Arts is located southwesl cf the village. If you do not know the way there, ask Sentry Kayleen fol cirections.
