Here is a *Scroll of Escape to the Townof Giran* as well a *Traveler's Mark*.<br1>
The Scroll can only be used once,remember! When you are ready to return to the Elven Village, visitTrader Galladucci and show him the Traveler's Mark.<br1>
A word of warning:Giran is a crowded and chaotic place, filled with all manner of scum andvillainy.<br1>
