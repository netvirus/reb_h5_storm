Gatekeeper Mirabel:<br>
Very well.<br1>
Here is a *Scroll of Escape to the Town of Giran* as well a *Traveler's Mark*.<br1>
The Scroll can only be used once, remember!<br1>
When you are ready to return to the Elven Village, visit Trader Galladucci and show him the Traveler's Mark.<br1>
A word of warning:<br1>
Giran is a crowded and chaotic place, filled with all manner of scum and villainy. Watch your back and your gold!
