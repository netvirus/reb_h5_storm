The outside world is a terribly chaotic place,nothing like our beautiful *Elven Forest*.<br1>
Don't get me wrong, we haveour share of problems, but nothing approaching the ravages that plaguethe world of the Humans.<br1>
But I've always said, "All young Elves shouldsee *Giran Castle Town* at least once!" It's a Human village and animportant travel hub.<br1>
It's also a microcosm of the outside world andwould be the perfect place for you to start your journey.<br1>
When you'reready to go, speak with *Gatekeeper Mirabel*.<br1>
I'll ask her to help you.<br1>
