Hierarch Asterios:<br>
I recently received a message from *Ariel*.<br1>
The outside world of the Humans who exiled us here has changed very much, to the point that it is unrecognizable to use Elves, living in isolation.<br1>
Their world is now one of total chaos! Far be it for me to deny a young Elf his travels, but I must remind you, there's much to be done here at home. You must prioritize.<br1>
Remember your home and the sacred Mother Tree!<br1>
You must promise to return one day!<br>
