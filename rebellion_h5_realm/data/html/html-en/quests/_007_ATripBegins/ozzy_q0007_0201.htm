I recently received a message from *Ariel*.<br1>
Theoutside world of the Humans who exiled us here has changed very much, tothe point that it is unrecognizable to use Elves, living in isolation.<br1>
Their world is now one of total chaos! Far be it for me to deny a youngElf his travels, but I must remind you, there's much to be done here athome.<br1>
You must prioritize.<br1>
