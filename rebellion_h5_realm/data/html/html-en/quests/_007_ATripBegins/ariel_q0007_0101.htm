Trader Ariel:<br>
You don't look like you're here to browse.<br1>
Is it because you think you're ready to venture into the outside world?<br1>
Heh ... perhaps you are.<br1>
Some might disagree with me, but I've come to accept that it's natural for a young elf such as yourself to want more than the protection of the Mother Tree.<br1>
A part of me is happy, yet a part of me is sad to see you go. Many different races, including orcs, dwarves and humans make up that place.<br1>
So it can't help but be very different from this place, where the only ones you'll meet are other elves.<br1>
Not all the memories you create for yourself will be happy ones.<br1>
Do you still want to venture to the world outside?<br>
