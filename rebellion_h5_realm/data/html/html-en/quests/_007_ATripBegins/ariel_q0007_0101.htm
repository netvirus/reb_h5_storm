You don't look like you're here to browse.<br1>
Is it becauseyou think you're ready to venture into the outside world? Heh .<br1>
perhaps you are.<br1>
Some might disagree with me, but I've come to acceptthat it's natural for a young elf such as yourself to want more than theprotection of the Mother Tree.<br1>
A part of me is happy, yet a part of meis sad to see you go.<br1>
Many different races, including orcs, dwarves andhumans make up that place.<br1>
So it can't help but be very different fromthis place, where the only ones you'll meet are other elves.<br1>
Not all thememories you create for yourself will be happy ones.<br1>
