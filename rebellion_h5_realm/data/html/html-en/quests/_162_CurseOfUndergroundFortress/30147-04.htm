I give you my deepest gratitude.<br1>
Go immediately to the*Underground Fortress* and bring me *ten undead bone fragments and threeElf skulls*.<br1>
The skulls must be whole and intact, with no flaws.<br1>
According to Sorcerer Esrandell, flawless and unscarred Elf skulls mayonly be obtained from the monsters called the *dark terrors*.<br1>
Darkterror, mist terror and shade horror .<br1>
they are all related.<br1>
I wish topresent my fellow soldiers, who have suffered long enough, with eternalpeace as soon as possible.<br1>
Please.<br1>
Hurry.<br1>
