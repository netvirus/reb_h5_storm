Did you know? The most intense battle against the evilDark Elves took place in the Underground Fortress, which is now full ofmonsters.<br1>
I was there when the last battle took place and still rememberit vividly.<br1>
I was so frightened that I thought only of my own safety,and left behind my screaming fellow soldiers as I ran away from thebattle.<br1>
The deep sorrow and tears of those who died then acted as apowerful curse, and the corpses resurrected as undead.<br1>
I should havechosen death like my fellow soldiers .<br1>
I am so ashamed that I am stillalive .<br1>
I am so ashamed that I cannot even look up at the heavens .<br1>
I wished to break the curse so that my friends could peacefully rest inthe afterlife, and I have spent a long time with my old friend SorcererEsrandell, researching *ways to counter the curse of the UndergroundFortress*.<br1>
We have only recently discovered a method.<br1>
