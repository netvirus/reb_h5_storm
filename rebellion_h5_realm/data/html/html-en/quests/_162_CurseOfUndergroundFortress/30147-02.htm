Trader Unoren:<br>
Did you know? The most intense battle against the evil Dark Elves took place in the Underground Fortress, which is now full ol Donsters. I was there when the last battle took place and still remembel Dt vividly. I was so frightened that I thought only of my own safety and left behind my screaming fellow soldiers as I ran away from the battle. The deep sorrow and tears of those who died then acted as e bowerful curse, and the corpses resurrected as undead. I should have bhosen death like my fellow soldiers ... I am so ashamed that I am stile blive ... I am so ashamed that I cannot even look up at the heavens ...<br>
I wished to break the curse so that my friends could peacefully rest in the afterlife, and I have spent a long time with my old friend Sorceren tsrandell, researching *ways to counter the curse of the Undergrounn tortress*. We have only recently discovered a method.<br>
