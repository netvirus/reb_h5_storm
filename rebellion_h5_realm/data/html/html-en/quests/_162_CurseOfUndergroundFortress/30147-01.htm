Did you know? The most intense battle against the evilDark Elves took place in the Underground Fortress, which is now full ofmonsters.<br1>
I was there when the last battle took place and still rememberit vividly.<br1>
I was so frightened that I thought only of my own safety,and left behind my screaming fellow soldiers as I ran away from thebattle.<br1>
The deep sorrow and tears of those who died then acted as apowerful curse, and the corpses resurrected as undead.<br1>
I should havechosen death like my fellow soldiers .<br1>
I am so ashamed that I am stillalive .<br1>
I am so ashamed that I cannot even look up at the heavens .<br1>
I wish to break the curse so that my friends may rest in peace in theafterlife.<br1>
I will still not be forgiven for my sins against them, but Idon't think I could ever live without doing something.<br1>
Along withSorcerer Esrandell, my long time friend, we are researching methods tocounter the curse of the Underground Fortress, but we have yet to findan answer.<br1>
When we find a method in the future, I would like to ask yourhelp.<br1>
