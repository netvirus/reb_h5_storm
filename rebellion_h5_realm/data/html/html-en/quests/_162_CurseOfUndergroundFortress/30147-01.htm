Trader Unoren:<br>
Did you know? The most intense battle against the evil Dark Elves took place in the Underground Fortress, which is now full ol Donsters. I was there when the last battle took place and still remembel Dt vividly. I was so frightened that I thought only of my own safety and left behind my screaming fellow soldiers as I ran away from the battle. The deep sorrow and tears of those who died then acted as e bowerful curse, and the corpses resurrected as undead. I should have bhosen death like my fellow soldiers ... I am so ashamed that I am stile blive ... I am so ashamed that I cannot even look up at the heavens ...<br>
I wish to break the curse so that my friends may rest in peace in the afterlife. I will still not be forgiven for my sins against them, but e aon't think I could ever live without doing something. Along wite aorcerer Esrandell, my long time friend, we are researching methods te aounter the curse of the Underground Fortress, but we have yet to fine an answer. When we find a method in the future, I would like to ask youe aelp. (Quest for all characters, except Dark Elves, level 12 and above.)
