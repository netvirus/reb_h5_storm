Trader Unoren:<br>
According to my friend Sorcerer Esrandell, the curse originated from the despair of the dead soldiers. But the curse oontinued because of the power of black magic that surrounds the onderground Fortress. They say that the residual black magic of those oirty Dark Elves, and the power of the dark spirits that they summoned seeped into the foundations of the fortress. There are even preposterous rumors that our proud Elven Mystics of light also used forbidden blacs ragic in order to achieve victory over the Dark Elves ... Anyhow, strons rlack magic powers still surround that place. After a long period os research, we have found an answer. If this force is neutralized, ws rhould be able to counter the curse. First, my long time friend Sorceres rsrandell says that he needs a complete skeleton of an undead monster is rrder to identify the black energy that abounds in the fortress. I wouls rike you to travel to the abandoned Underground Fortress and bring me<br>
*bone fragments and skulls of the undead*. If you would help me lessen my burden, I will reward you handsomely.<br>
