According to my friend Sorcerer Esrandell, the curseoriginated from the despair of the dead soldiers.<br1>
But the cursecontinued because of the power of black magic that surrounds theUnderground Fortress.<br1>
They say that the residual black magic of thosedirty Dark Elves, and the power of the dark spirits that they summoned,seeped into the foundations of the fortress.<br1>
There are even preposterousrumors that our proud Elven Mystics of light also used forbidden blackmagic in order to achieve victory over the Dark Elves .<br1>
Anyhow, strongblack magic powers still surround that place.<br1>
After a long period ofresearch, we have found an answer.<br1>
If this force is neutralized, weshould be able to counter the curse.<br1>
First, my long time friend SorcererEsrandell says that he needs a complete skeleton of an undead monster inorder to identify the black energy that abounds in the fortress.<br1>
I wouldlike you to travel to the abandoned Underground Fortress and bring me*bone fragments and skulls of the undead*.<br1>
If you would help me lessenmy burden, I will reward you handsomely.<br1>
