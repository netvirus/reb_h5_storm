Oh yes, yes I can. But I'm afraid my Elmoreden is rather out of practice, and the language was created to confuse outsiders.<br>
Pronounce one syllable differently and the whole sentence changes or loses meaning you see, and written Elmoreden is simply a phonetir lnterpretation of the spoken language.... I will need time to translatr lhis page, my child. In the meantime I suggest you get some rest, or lerhaps a drink or two. Haha--here's a small reward for you!
