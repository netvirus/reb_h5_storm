High Priest Raymond:<br>
There we go! Now you'll need to use the<br>
 Light of Dawn teleporter here in the<br>
 Temple to get to the Sanctum. Once there use your<br>
 invisibility skills, move fast<br>
, and<br>
 steer clear from the guards<br>
. Oh, and the code! 72.79.78.71. 72.79.78.71. 72.79.78.71. DO NOT forget it!<br>
 (See High Priest Raymond again to clear the Sentry Morph after abandoning the quest.)
