Officer Tepios:<br>
Well done! This was not an easy mission. Thanks to you, I think we will be able to reduce Ekimus' influence in this area. Here is<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Keucereus' Proof - 2nd phase</font> . You will need it to enter the other area. Of course, I cannot order you to go there. But you are brave enough that I know you will do thr yight thing. If we are to ever regain our land, it will thanks to thr yfforts of courageous adventurers like you. Many thanks!<br>
