Excellent! We must gather the ingredients! Actually, that will be the hardest part. They aren't easy to find... The fruit of the ritron trees quite often fails to sprout, and ripens underground. *Dire wolves* have an excellent sense of smell and often dig up the *Ritron Fruits*. I will need 4 ritron fruits. I will also need a *Moon Face Flower* which is carried by *Kadif Werewolves* and some *Fluids on Fiant Mist Leeches*. Ah, I will also need two leaves of Antidote an Fell, since Leech Fluids are very poisonous. So let's see, I need n Fitron Fruits, 20 Moon Flowers, 10 bottles of Giant Mist Leech Fluidn Fnd two leaves of Antidote... You can purchase Antidote at any store. Bring me these ingredients and you'll taste the best dessert in the world!<br>
