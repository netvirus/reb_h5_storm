Excellent! We must gather the ingredients! Actually,that will be the hardest part.<br1>
They aren't easy to find.<br1>
The fruit ofthe ritron trees quite often fails to sprout, and ripens underground.<br1>
*Dire wolves* have an excellent sense of smell and often dig up the*Ritron Fruits*.<br1>
I will need 4 ritron fruits.<br1>
I will also need a *MoonFace Flower* which is carried by *Kadif Werewolves* and some *Fluids ofGiant Mist Leeches*.<br1>
Ah, I will also need two leaves of Antidote aswell, since Leech Fluids are very poisonous.<br1>
So let's see, I need 4Ritron Fruits, 20 Moon Flowers, 10 bottles of Giant Mist Leech Fluidsand two leaves of Antidote.<br1>
You can purchase Antidote at any store.<br1>
