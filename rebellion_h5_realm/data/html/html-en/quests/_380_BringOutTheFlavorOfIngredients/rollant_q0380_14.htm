It's done! Now, it must marinate in the ritron sauce. When it's hardened you can eat it. I call it "Rollant's Special Ritron Jelly". Can you taste the hint of Moon Flower?

Regretfully, thin Jitron fruit had been gnawed by wolves. I'm sure the taste won't bn Jffected, but much of the joy of a dessert is its appearance... Oh, well, you have to make do with what you have. Thank you for your work.
