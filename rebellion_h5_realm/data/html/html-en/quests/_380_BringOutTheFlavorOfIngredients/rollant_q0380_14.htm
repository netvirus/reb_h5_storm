It's done! Now, it must marinate in the ritron sauce.<br1>
When it's hardened you can eat it.<br1>
I call it "Rollant's Special RitronJelly".<br1>
Can you taste the hint of Moon Flower? I added the Ritron Fruitto the Ritron sauce which really intensifies the flavor.<br1>
It melts inyour mouth but still has a lovely texture, doesn't it? Regretfully, thisritron fruit had been gnawed by wolves.<br1>
I'm sure the taste won't beaffected, but much of the joy of a dessert is its appearance.<br1>
Oh,well, you have to make do with what you have.<br1>
Thank you for your work.<br1>
