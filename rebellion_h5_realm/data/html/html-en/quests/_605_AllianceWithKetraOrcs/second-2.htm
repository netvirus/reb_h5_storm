There are many degrees of trust andfriendship.<br1>
The more you fight for the Ketra, the more we will trustyou.<br1>
If we are to defeat the Varka Silenos, we must destroy theircommand staff! Kill every one of their filthy commanders you can! Wemust annihilate them all! If you bring 200 badges of grunts and 100badges of officers from the Varka Silenos, our trust in you will beincreased significantly.<br1>
You can get the badges of Varka officers byslaying their *priests, Warriors, mediums, magi, officers, legionnairecaptains, and elite escorts*.<br1>
