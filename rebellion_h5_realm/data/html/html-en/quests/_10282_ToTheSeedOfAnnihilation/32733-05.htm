Like the other Seeds that have floated into Gracia,the easiest, and right now, only way to get to the Seed of Annihilationis by *flight*.<br1>
You either need access to an airship or know the AuraBird Transformation.<br1>
If you don't have an airship, the Dwarf they call*Engineer Lekon* below is who you should talk to.<br1>
*Officer Tolonis*might also sell you one.<br1>
As for the Aura Bird Transformation, I couldn'ttell you how to learn it, I honestly don't know.<br1>
