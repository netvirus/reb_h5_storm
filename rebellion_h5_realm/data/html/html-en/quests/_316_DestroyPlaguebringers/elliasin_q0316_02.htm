<font color="36DC25">Master Ellenia:</font><br>
Have you ever seen the race called the ratmen? We*Elves* call that lowly race "plague bringers.<br1>
" Originally no diseaseexisted anywhere in the *Elven Forest*.<br1>
But when the dirty ratmenentered our forest, they spread disease and plague, and we learned forthe first time what it means to become ill and weak.<br1>
Moreover, theratmen were paid to fight for the *Dark Elves* as mercenary soldiersduring our war with the dark ones.<br1>
Countless Elven brothers lost theirlives to that disgusting race.<br1>
Never can we forget or forgive the sinsthat they committed against us.<br1>
Heed my words .<br1>
there will come a daywhen those plague bringers will be destroyed.<br1>
When that time comes,please take up your sword and join in the sacred task of dealing withthe ratmen.<br1>
