<font color="FF8000">Master Ellenia:</font><br>
Have you ever seen the race called the ratmen? We Elvescall that lowly race "plague bringers.<br1>
" Originally no disease existedanywhere in the *Elven Forest*.<br1>
But when the dirty ratmen entered ourforest, they spread disease and plague, and we learned for the firsttime what it means to become ill and weak.<br1>
Their nest has recently beenuncovered, and a group will be sent soon to eradicate them.<br1>
We willsurely drive the plague bringers out of our forest.<br1>
But this is businessbetween Elves and ratmen.<br1>
I don't think the one of a foreign race, likeyourself, should be involved.<br1>
