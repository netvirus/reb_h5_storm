As I told you, the thief's identity is an Orc named *Calpico*.<br1>
The fellow is very elusive, so you never know when he will show up or where, but a few days ago a report said that he was seen near the *School of Dark Arts* in the Dark Forest.<br1>
If you search in the vicinity of the School of Dark Arts, you will be able to find the scoundrel's hiding place.<br>
