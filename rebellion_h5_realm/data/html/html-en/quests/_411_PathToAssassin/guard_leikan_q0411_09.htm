As I told you, the thief's identity is an Orc named*Calpico*.<br1>
The fellow is very elusive, so you never know when he willshow up or where, but a few days ago a report said that he was seen nearthe *School of Dark Arts* in the Dark Forest.<br1>
If you search in thevicinity of the School of Dark Arts, you will be able to find thescoundrel's hiding place.<br1>
