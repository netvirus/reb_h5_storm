<font color="36DC25">Guard Leikan:</font><br>
The thieves that stole your race's treasures? Ah...<br1>
I do know roughly where they live, but.<br1>
I could tell you, but there is one condition.<br1>
If you accept one request, I will give you information on the thieves.<br1>
Please don't think I am stingy.<br1>
A man must do something to survive.<br1>
Nothing is free in this world.<br1>
There is an ancient saying that you go bald if you take things for free.<br1>
Ha ha ha .<br>
