Hmm .<br1>
So the likes of you wants to change profession to anAssassin? Good.<br1>
As luck would have it, I was just now in need of animble fellow.<br1>
You must know that the foundation of an Assassin is quickmovements! Use this opportunity to prove your skills to me! Now takethis and go to *Arkenia of the Dark Elf coming-of-age ceremony altar.<br1>
*You don't know how to go to the coming-of-age ceremony altar? Wretchedfellow! Go out the east gate of the village and run to the north! Thenyou will reach the Neutral Zone.<br1>
There is a bridge to the west thatconnects to the Dark Forest.<br1>
After you cross the bridge, follow the roadwest until you reach the altar.<br1>
