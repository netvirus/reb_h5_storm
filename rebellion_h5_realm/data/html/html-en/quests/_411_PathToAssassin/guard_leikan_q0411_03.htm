Actually, I recently boasted to my colleagues that I was attacked by moonstone beasts while returning from the Dark Forest, and that I killed several.<br1>
My colleagues didn't believe me and asked to see proof.<br1>
This put me in a rather... awkward position.<br1>
So you see, I need ten moonstone beast molars.<br1>
Please get some for me.<br1>
You can easily find moonstone beasts north of here in the *Neutral Zone*.<br1>
Take this memo.<br1>
I tis a simple contract stating our agreement.<br1>
Remember, *you must bring back ten moonstone beast molars and then I will give you information.<br>
