Actually, I recently boasted to my colleagues that I was attacked by moonstone beasts while returning from the Dark Forest, ans ahat I killed several. My colleagues didn't believe me and asked to ses aroof. This put me in a rather ... awkward position. So you see, I nees aen moonstone beast molars. Please get some for me. You can easily fins aoonstone beasts north of here in the *Neutral Zone*. Take this memo. Is as a simple contract stating our agreement. Remember, *you must brins aack ten moonstone beast molars and then I will give you information.*<br>
