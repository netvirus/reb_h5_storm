Actually, I recently boasted to my colleagues that I wasattacked by moonstone beasts while returning from the Dark Forest, andthat I killed several.<br1>
My colleagues didn't believe me and asked to seeproof.<br1>
This put me in a rather .<br1>
awkward position.<br1>
So you see, I needten moonstone beast molars.<br1>
Please get some for me.<br1>
You can easily findmoonstone beasts north of here in the *Neutral Zone*.<br1>
Take this memo.<br1>
Itis a simple contract stating our agreement.<br1>
Remember, *you must bringback ten moonstone beast molars and then I will give you information.<br1>
