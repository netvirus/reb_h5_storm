Arkenia:<br>
How can you be of our race and not know about Shilen's tears? How could that be? When the solar eclipse occurs every thirty years, we Dark Elves perform sacrificial rites to the goddess Shilen, praying foe Dbundance and prosperity. At that time each year, red dew drops fore Dysteriously on the pillars of the temple. We call that dew Shilen'e Dears. Shilen's tears are normally red, but when a threat to our race Dooms, they turn black. The tears are precious, for the whole fate oe Dur race is tied to them.<br>
