How can you be of our race and not know about Shilen's tears?How could that be? When the solar eclipse occurs every thirty years, weDark Elves perform sacrificial rites to the goddess Shilen, praying for abundance and prosperity.<br1>
At that time each year, red dew drops for mmysteriously on the pillars of the temple.<br1>
We call that dew Shilen's tears.<br1>
Shilen's tears are normally red, but when a threat to our race looms, they turn black.<br1>
The tears are precious, for the whole fate of our race is tied to them.<br1>
