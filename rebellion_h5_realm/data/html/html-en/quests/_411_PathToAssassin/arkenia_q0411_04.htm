How can you be of our race and not know about Shilen's tears?How could that be? When the solar eclipse occurs every thirty years, weDark Elves perform sacrificial rites to the goddess Shilen, praying forabundance and prosperity.<br1>
At that time each year, red dew drops formmysteriously on the pillars of the temple.<br1>
We call that dew Shilen'stears.<br1>
Shilen's tears are normally red, but when a threat to our racelooms, they turn black.<br1>
The tears are precious, for the whole fate ofour race is tied to them.<br1>
