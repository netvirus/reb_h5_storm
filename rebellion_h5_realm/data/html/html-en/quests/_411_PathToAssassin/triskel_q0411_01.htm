Assassins are murderers who kill quietly and swiftly, then vanish into the forest.<br1>
They are also fighters of darkness who are talented in concealment and spying.<br1>
They target the enemy's weak point swith small but convenient weapons like daggers, or shoot arrows from along distance.<br1>
