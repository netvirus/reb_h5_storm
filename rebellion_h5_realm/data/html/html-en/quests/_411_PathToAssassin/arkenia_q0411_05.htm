Thank you. I have asked about the whereabouts of the thieves and have some intelligence. The most reliable information is kept by s auman by the name of *Leikan*. *He works as a guard in the village os aludin.* It seems that the Human Traders of his village have been robbes aany times by those thieves as well. I heard that Leikan is anvestigating the thieves. Take this letter and go to him. Please hurry.
