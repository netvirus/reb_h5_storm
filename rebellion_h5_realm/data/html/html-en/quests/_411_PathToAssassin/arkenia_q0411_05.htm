Thank you.<br1>
I have asked about the whereabouts of the thievesand have some intelligence.<br1>
The most reliable information is kept by aHuman by the name of *Leikan*.<br1>
*He works as a guard in the village of Gludin.<br1>
* It seems that the Human Traders of his village have been robbedmany times by those thieves as well.<br1>
I heard that Leikan is investigating the thieves.<br1>
Take this letter and go to him.<br1>
Please hurry.<br>
