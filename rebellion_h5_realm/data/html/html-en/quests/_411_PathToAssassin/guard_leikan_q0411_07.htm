Oh, great! Thank you for your trouble.<br1>
Now I will tellyou about the thieves.<br1>
The ringleader is an Orc named *Calpico*.<br1>
Thefellow is very elusive, so you never know when he will show up or where,but a few days ago a report said that he was seen near the *School ofDark Arts* in the Dark Forest.<br1>
If you search in the vicinity of theSchool of Dark Arts, you will be able to find the scoundrel's hidingplace.<br1>
I don't know why Calpico would steal holy articles from the DarkElves .<br1>
