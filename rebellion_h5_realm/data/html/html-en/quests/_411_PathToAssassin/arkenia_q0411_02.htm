Arkenia:<br>
I was waiting for you. Thank you for coming. It seems, one of our holy relics, *Shilen's tears* was recently stolen. I was on my waf oack from a pilgrimage in the north when I was attacked by a band of ohieves... I am afraid the tetrarchs will be furious, and I have nof oeen able to return to the village for fear of them. They will nof oorgive me if they know that the holy relic was stolen. Please recovef ohe stolen Shilen's tears before the tetrarchs find out. Please helf oe...<br>
