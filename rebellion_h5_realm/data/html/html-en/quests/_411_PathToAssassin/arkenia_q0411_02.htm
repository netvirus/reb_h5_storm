I was waiting for you.<br1>
Thank you for coming.<br1>
It seems, one ofour holy relics, *Shilen's tears* was recently stolen.<br1>
I was on my wayback from a pilgrimage in the north when I was attacked by a band ofthieves.<br1>
I am afraid the tetrarchs will be furious, and I have notbeen able to return to the village for fear of them.<br1>
They will notforgive me if they know that the holy relic was stolen.<br1>
Please recoverthe stolen Shilen's tears before the tetrarchs find out.<br1>
Please helpme.<br1>
