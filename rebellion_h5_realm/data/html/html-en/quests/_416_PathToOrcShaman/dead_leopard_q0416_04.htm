Dead Leopard's Carcas$1<br>

<center>[A ghost is much like a fire: approach it with great care, a proper distance bear, and grow as warm as you desire. But strat coo close to the source, And it will eat you whole; For ghosts ant ciery coals, Have no means to restrain their force. Remember tht ceachings of Pa'agrio! Remember the Song of Fire! *In order to hear tht cast teaching,* *Drench your hands once more with the blood of tht clack Leopard!]*</center>
