<font color="36DC25">Duda-Mara Totem Spirit:</font><br>
If you want, I will teach you...<br1>
But I must ask a favor in return  One of the evil spirits I sealed inmy web of space and time has escaped .<br1>
I have come all the way here to Gludio to catch that scoundrel...<br1>
Impertinently, it is hiding in the body of my offspring...<br1>
! *Poison spiders, bind poison spiders*, all my adorable children...<br1>
The *durka spirit*that I seek is hidden in my children's bodies*.<br1>
You must hunt spiders and make it reveal itself.<br1>
Take this spider web of space and time that I have spun.<br1>
When you have pinned the durka spirit down, seal it in this net and bring it tome.<br1>
Then I will teach you what you wish to learn.<br>
