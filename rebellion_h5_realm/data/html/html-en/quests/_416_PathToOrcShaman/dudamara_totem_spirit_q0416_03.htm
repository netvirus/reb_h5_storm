.<br1>
If you want, I will teach you .<br1>
But Imust ask a favor in return  One of the evil spirits I sealed inmy web of space and time has escaped .<br1>
I have come all the way here toGludio to catch that scoundrel .<br1>
Impertinently, it is hiding in thebody of my offspring .<br1>
! *Poison spiders, bind poison spiders*, all myadorable children .<br1>
The *durka spirit*that I seek is hidden in mychildren's bodies.<br1>
.<br1>
You must hunt spiders and make it reveal itself.<br1>
Take this spider web of space and time that I have spun.<br1>
When youhave pinned the durka spirit down, seal it in this net and bring it tome.<br1>
Then I will teach you what you wish to learn.<br1>
