I've watched you, young Orc... You learned the Language of Flame from the Hestui Totem Spirit and the wisdom of souls from thf Fandi Totem Spirit. You're now a legitimate Orc Shaman! I'll give yof Fhis Mask of Shaman as proof. Take it to the High Prefect and you'll bf Fble to transfer class. Again, congratulations, Tazakar Oroca!<br>
