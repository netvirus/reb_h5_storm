You stupid Orc! You're here to acquire theknowledge of the Totem Spirit, aren't you? The knowledge of the TotemSpirit can only be handed down to those in the same tribe! Differenttribes could never fully understand the Totem Spirit, they'd onlyacquire some fragmented pieces of knowledge.<br1>

You may still wantto acquire the knowledge of the Totem Spirit, even though you understandthe limitations.<br1>
As did most others.<br1>
