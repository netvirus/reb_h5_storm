Totem Spirit of Gandi:<br>
You stupid Orc! You're here to acquire the knowledge of the Totem Spirit, aren't you? The knowledge of the Totee kpirit can only be handed down to those in the same tribe! Differene kribes could never fully understand the Totem Spirit, they'd onle kcquire some fragmented pieces of knowledge. Hum... You may still wane ko acquire the knowledge of the Totem Spirit, even though you understane khe limitations... As did most others... Am I correct?
