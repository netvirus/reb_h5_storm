The language of flame cannot be taught, only learned.<br1>
Confused? Ha! If you wish to learn the language of flame, my youngfriend, you must summon the Hestui Totem Spirit.<br1>
The spirit, who takesthe form of a Kasha Bear, symbolizes dignity and wisdom.<br1>
Beforeattempting the summoning, however, you must first bring me a *Kasha BearPelt and Kasha Bladespider Husk*.<br1>
You must also hunt the *ScarletSalamander* and obtain one of its *Fiery Eggs*.<br1>
