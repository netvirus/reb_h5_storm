Now I will make you a totem mask from the Kasha BearPelt and Kasha Bladespider Husk you brought.<br1>
It will enable you to learnthe language of flame when you meet our Hestui Totem Spirit.<br1>
The FieryEgg you obtained from the Scarlet Salamander contains an unborn spiritwhose existence is not yet ordained.<br1>
It is truly a valuable item, fit tooffer to the Totem Spirit as a gift.<br1>
Now go to the Ruins south of theTemple of Pa'agrio and seek the *Hestui Totem Spirit*.<br1>
