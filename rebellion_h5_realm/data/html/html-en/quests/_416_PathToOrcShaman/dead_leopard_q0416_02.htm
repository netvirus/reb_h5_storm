<font color="36DC25">Dead Leopard Body:</font><br>
There's a strange song coming from somewhere.<br1>
At last you discover the source: it issues from the mouth of a dead leopard.<br1>
The song sounds vaguely familiar yet somehow outlandish as well, like a song you might have heard a foreigner sing as a child.<br1>
[. . . Zakar Gandi! Tejakar Leopa! O, forgotten song, lost amid the long tribal battles! O, my fellow warriors, once a mighty army, now scattered to the winds!]<br1>
