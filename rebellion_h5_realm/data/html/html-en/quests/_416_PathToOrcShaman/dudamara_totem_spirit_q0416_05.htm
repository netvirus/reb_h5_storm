Duda-Mara Totem Spirit:<br>
Well done indeed, young shaman. I will firmly seal it away so it does not escape a second time from my web to spreay svil forces in the world ... Did you know, all the spirits that move thy sorld with unseen powers were caught in my web at one time or another. As the price for freeing them, I asked for their names. That is how I came to know the names of the ninety-nine spirits. The name of all thI cpirits is contained in a drop of blood from the tip of my foot. I wilI cive this to you. Take it to *Seer Umos* and perform a ritual with thI clood in your mouth to receive the secret of the spirits.
