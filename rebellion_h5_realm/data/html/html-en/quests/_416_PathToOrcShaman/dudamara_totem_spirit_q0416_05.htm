<font color="36DC25">Duda-Mara Totem Spirit:</font><br>
Well done indeed, young shaman.<br1>
I will firmly seal it away so it does not escape a second time from my web to spread evil forces in the world...<br1>
Did you know, all the spirits that move the world with unseen powers were caught in my web at one time or another.<br1>
As the price for freeing them, I asked for their names.<br1>
That is how I came to know the names of the ninety-nine spirits.<br1>
The name of all the spirits is contained in a drop of blood from the tip of my foot.<br1>
I willgive this to you.<br1>
Take it to *Seer Umos* and perform a ritual with the blood in your mouth to receive the secret of the spirits.<br1>
