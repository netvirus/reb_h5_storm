Well done indeed, young shaman.<br1>
I will firmlyseal it away so it does not escape a second time from my web to spreadevil forces in the world .<br1>
Did you know, all the spirits that move theworld with unseen powers were caught in my web at one time or another.<br1>
As the price for freeing them, I asked for their names.<br1>
That is how Icame to know the names of the ninety-nine spirits.<br1>
The name of all thespirits is contained in a drop of blood from the tip of my foot.<br1>
I willgive this to you.<br1>
Take it to *Seer Umos* and perform a ritual with theblood in your mouth to receive the secret of the spirits.<br1>
