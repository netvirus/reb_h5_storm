<font color="36DC25">Tataru Zu Hestui:</font><br>
The great Hestui Totem Spirit guards the very secret of the universe: the means through which we communicate with the spirits.<br1>
The language of flame cannot be taught nor recorded on scrolls-- it can only be learned, as you have done, through fire and pain and blood.<br1>
Your first step is complete.<br1>
Now, if you wish to be able to command the spirits themselves, you must learn the *Names of the 99 Spirits*.<br1>
Go to *Gludin* in the Human land of Aden and show Seer Umos this letter of recommendation.<br1>
He will guide you to the next step.<br1>
