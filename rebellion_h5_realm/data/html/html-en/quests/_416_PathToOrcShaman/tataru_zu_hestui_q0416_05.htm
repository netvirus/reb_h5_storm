To master the authority of flame and truly govern the spirits, you must learn 2 things.<br1>
First, you must learn the language of flame, which is the language of the spirits, in order to communicate with them.<br1>
Second, you must learn the names of the 99 spirits in order to acquire power over them.<br1>
Unless you accomplish both tasks, you cannot become a true Orc Shaman.<br1>
