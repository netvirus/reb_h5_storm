I will put the grizzly's blood you have brought in this cauldron.<br1>
Take this to the* Duda-Mara Totem Spirit*.<br1>
If it tries to threaten you, quickly offer the cauldron as a gift.<br1>
If you are a single second late, you may spend eternity tied up in its spider web.<br1>
When you offer the blood as a gift, ask to be taught about the names of the spirits .<br1>
You must keep this in mind.<br1>
Well then, I hope you return having learned the secret of the spirits.<br1>
May the divine protection of flame be with you.<br>
