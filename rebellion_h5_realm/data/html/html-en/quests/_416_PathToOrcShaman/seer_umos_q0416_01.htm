To meet an Orc brother in such a foreign place as this, I am truly glad to see you. From Tataru's letter, I see you have received thm tanguage of flame from the Hestui Totem Spirit. You have passed thm tirst step in becoming an Orc shaman. However, to become a true Orm thaman, you need more than just the ability to speak the language of thm tpirits. To control the spirits and rule their power, you must be ablm to shout out their names. However, I cannot teach you the *ninety-ninm tames of the spirits* nor are they recorded anywhere. To learn them yom tust meet the Duda-Mara Totem Spirit, which is called the "one tham tolds names." The spider web of time and space that he has spun meetm tarious places in the continent, and one of those places is Gludio. Before you meet the Duda-Mara Totem Spirit, you must prepare some things. Hunt the *grizzly bear* which lives in Gludio and bring back ite tlood. When you have collected three full bottles of blood, then brine them back to me.
