To meet an Orc brother in such a foreign place as this, I amtruly glad to see you.<br1>
From Tataru's letter, I see you have received thelanguage of flame from the Hestui Totem Spirit.<br1>
You have passed thefirst step in becoming an Orc shaman.<br1>
However, to become a true OrcShaman, you need more than just the ability to speak the language of thespirits.<br1>
To control the spirits and rule their power, you must be ableto shout out their names.<br1>
However, I cannot teach you the *ninety-ninenames of the spirits* nor are they recorded anywhere.<br1>
To learn them youmust meet the Duda-Mara Totem Spirit, which is called the "one thatholds names.<br1>
" The spider web of time and space that he has spun meetsvarious places in the continent, and one of those places is Gludio.<br1>
Before you meet the Duda-Mara Totem Spirit, you must prepare somethings.<br1>
Hunt the *grizzly bear* which lives in Gludio and bring back itsblood.<br1>
When you have collected three full bottles of blood, then bringthem back to me.<br1>
