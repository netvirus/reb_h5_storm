I bought these arrows from the weapon shop when I went to thevillage few days ago.<br1>
Trader Lector took care in selecting these, so youcan use them without any worries.<br1>
Personally, I would shoot arrows froma far distance to wound the spider, then approach it to deliver thefinal blow .<br1>
but I'm sure you have your own ways of hunting them.<br1>
