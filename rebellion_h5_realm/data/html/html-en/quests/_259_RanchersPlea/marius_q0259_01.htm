May the blessings of the starlight fall upon you.<br1>
So you arethe mercenary hired by my colleague Edmond.<br1>
I was once a Knight with asword .<br1>
But .<br1>
something happened.<br1>
And I pledged not to touch a swordagain.<br1>
I have retired now.<br1>
I felt terrible that I haven't been able helpEdmond .<br1>
Thankfully, I owe you gratitude for volunteering to killthese spiders for us.<br1>
Tell me anything you need.<br1>
If you bring me tengiant spider husks, I will exchange them for a healing potion or arrows.<br1>
