Thank you for your trouble.<br1>
I hope you didn't get hurt? As wepromised, I will reward you for each giant spider husk that you havebrought.<br1>
Here, take this.<br1>
Thanks to your help, I will soon be able tograze my cattle without any worries.<br1>
Just thinking of that makes me sohappy.<br1>
I can picture my sheep peacefully grazing in the pastures on thegreen hillside.<br1>
