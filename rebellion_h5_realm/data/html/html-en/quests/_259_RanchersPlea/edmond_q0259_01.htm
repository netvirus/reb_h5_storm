Welcome, traveler.<br1>
I originally resided in Gludio, but lost myfamily during the war with Gracia and moved here to start a new life.<br1>
Iam trying to ranch here with my old friend, Marius.<br1>
We were going totake our sheep to the sunny hillside right over there and turn them outto pasture .<br1>
But the giant spiders showed up, and we lost all thirtysheep that we brought from Innadril.<br1>
Soon, we're going to hire someoneto kill the giant spiders around this area.<br1>
