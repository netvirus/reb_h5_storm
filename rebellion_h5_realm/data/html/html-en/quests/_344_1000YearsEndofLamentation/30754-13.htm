<font color="36DC25">Antharas Watchman Gilmore:</font><br>
This sword belonged to one of my aides whofought alongside me against Antharas 1,000 years ago.<br1>
In the interveningyears the blade must have rusted away and only this hilt is left.<br1>
He wasa swordsman without parallel.<br1>
It is said that one of his descendantsis living in *Oren Castle Town*.<br1>
It is likely that he is following thefamily tradition of being a *Duelist*.<br1>
I am unable to leave this valleyor I would take this relic to him.<br1>
Would you please do this for me? Iwill pay you for your trouble.<br1>
