This looks like a badge from our temple? Don'ttell me.<br1>
Could it be a relic from the battle against Antharas 1,000years ago? How could it be? I have always feared that our efforts toslay Antharas have been in vain.<br1>
This old badge tells me that ourresponsibilities cannot be avoided, no matter the cost.<br1>
Thank you, youngtraveler.<br1>
Please take this small token of appreciation from our temple.<br1>
