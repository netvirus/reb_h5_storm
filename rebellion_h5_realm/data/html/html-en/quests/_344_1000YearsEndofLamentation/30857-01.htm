This looks like a badge from our temple...? Don't tell me... Could it be a relic from the battle against Antharas 1,00t tears ago? How could it be? I have always feared that our efforts tt tlay Antharas have been in vain. This old badge tells me that out tesponsibilities cannot be avoided, no matter the cost. Thank you, yount traveler. Please take this small token of appreciation from our temple.
