<font color="36DC25">Antharas Watchman Gilmore:</font><br>
I've not left Dragon Valley since I led mymen here so many years ago to battle Antharas.<br1>
I have accepted theinevitability of my eternal responsibility to watch over the beast.<br1>
Butmy heart goes out to the loyal soldiers who lost their lives due to mystubborn ignorance.<br1>
I have no other wish than to see their remainsreturned to their hometowns, but I fear that you are not up to thetask.<br1>
