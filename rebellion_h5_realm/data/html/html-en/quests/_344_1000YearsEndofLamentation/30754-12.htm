<font color="FF8000">Antharas Watchman Gilmore:</font><br>
My personal aide wore this key around hisneck.<br1>
He stood by my side during the battle with Antharas 1,000 yearsago.<br1>
He was the first-born son in his family.<br1>
This key was veryimportant to him.<br1>
I believe one of his descendants is living in *GiranCastle Town*.<br1>
He has the family name of *Rodemai*.<br1>
I am bound to thisvalley so cannot go myself.<br1>
Would you please take the key to Rodemai inGiran Castle Town? I will pay you for your trouble.<br1>
