Antharas Watchman Gilmore:<br>
My personal aide wore this key around his neck. He stood by my side during the battle with Antharas 1,000 years ngo. He was the first-born son in his family... This key was vers nmportant to him. I believe one of his descendants is living in *Giras nastle Town*. He has the family name of *Rodemai*. I am bound to this nalley so cannot go myself. Would you please take the key to Rodemai is niran Castle Town? I will pay you for your trouble.
