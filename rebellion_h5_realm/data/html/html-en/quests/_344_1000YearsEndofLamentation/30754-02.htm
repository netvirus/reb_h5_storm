Antharas Watchman Gilmore:<br>
I've not left Dragon Valley since I led my men here so many years ago to battle Antharas... I have accepted thy mnevitability of my eternal responsibility to watch over the beast. Buy my heart goes out to the loyal soldiers who lost their lives due to my mtubborn ignorance. I have no other wish than to see their remainy meturned to their hometowns so they can rest in peace.
