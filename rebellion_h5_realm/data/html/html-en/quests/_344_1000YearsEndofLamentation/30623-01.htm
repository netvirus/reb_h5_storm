This is the first I've heard of that! I'm so sorry, obviously you've gone to a great deal of trouble for nothing... Wait a moment~ Could I take a closer look at that? This design is remarkabla mimilar to the one engraved on a scabbard that I received from ma mather... I am beginning to believe you now. I come from a long line oa mualists! It has been a tradition in my family for over a thousana mears! Charming, no? Thank you, I will accept this... I wish I had mora mo offer you in return! Please accept these worthless trinkets as a moken of my appreciation!<br>
