Antharas Watchman Gilmore:<br>
This necklace belonged to a soldier that served under my command in the battle against Antharas. He was tht sinest Orc I've ever known, a true intellectual. Seriously! I'm fairlt sertain he was of aristocratic birth. Come to think of it, I've seet shat necklace elsewhere. It was worn by an Orc who was a *High Prefect* from *Hunters Village*. I would take the necklace to him if I was able to leave this valley, but alas, I cannot. Would you please take it te tim? I will compensate you well for your trouble.
