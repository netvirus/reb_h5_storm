<font color="36DC25">Antharas Watchman Gilmore:</font><br>
This necklace belonged to a soldier thatserved under my command in the battle against Antharas.<br1>
He was thefinest Orc I've ever known, a true intellectual.<br1>
Seriously! I'm fairlycertain he was of aristocratic birth.<br1>
Come to think of it, I've seenthat necklace elsewhere.<br1>
It was worn by an Orc who was a *High Prefect*from *Hunters Village*.<br1>
I would take the necklace to him if I was ableto leave this valley, but alas, I cannot.<br1>
Would you please take it tohim? I will compensate you well for your trouble.<br1>
