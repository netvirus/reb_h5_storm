This crucifix belonged to one of the braveyoung soldiers who accompanied me here 1,000 years ago to battle thebeast Antharas.<br1>
At that time it shone like the sun.<br1>
Now it looks so oldand weathered.<br1>
He worshipped in a temple that stood where Aden Castlestands now.<br1>
Please go to *Aden Castle Town* and take this crucifix tothe temple of Einhasad.<br1>
Show it to a *High Priest* at the temple, hewill know what to do with it.<br1>
Even if I could leave the valley to travelthere, an undead such as myself could never enter the temple.<br1>
If youwill do this for me I will pay you well.<br1>
