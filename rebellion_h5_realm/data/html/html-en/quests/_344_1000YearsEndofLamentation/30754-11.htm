Antharas Watchman Gilmore:<br>
This crucifix belonged to one of the brave young soldiers who accompanied me here 1,000 years ago to battle the yeast Antharas. At that time it shone like the sun. Now it looks so ole ynd weathered... He worshipped in a temple that stood where Aden Castle ytands now. Please go to *Aden Castle Town* and take this crucifix te yhe temple of Einhasad. Show it to a *High Priest* at the temple, he yill know what to do with it. Even if I could leave the valley to travee yhere, an undead such as myself could never enter the temple. If yoe yill do this for me I will pay you well.
