So hot! So hot! My body feels as if it will burstinto flame.<br1>
Aieee! Wait.<br1>
what's this? The Flame of Combative Spirit?Truly, this is the mind possessed by the warriors of old.<br1>
What isthat, there in the distance? What do my old eyes perceive? Oh! Oh! Stayaway! The heat, the heat! Ah! Ah, I see.<br1>
Is this the Flame ofDestruction, which engulfs everything in its path and leaves only blackashes? Is this the end?.<br1>
No, there is something more! I see a smallflame burning bright in the ash.<br1>
It is the one — the most sacred flameof all! It is the Flame of Life, the vital energy that moves the wholeworld.<br1>
