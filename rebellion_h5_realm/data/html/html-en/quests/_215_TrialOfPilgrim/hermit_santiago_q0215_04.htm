<font color="FF8000">Hermit Santiago:</font><br>
I will now impart to you a great truth.<br1>
The people ofthis land have distorted and twisted the myths of their gods to suittheir own financial and political ends.<br1>
This is probably also true aboutthe myths that you were taught.<br1>
I teach a method of purging your mindof all the indoctrination that has come before, and learning the secretsof the gods afresh.<br1>
