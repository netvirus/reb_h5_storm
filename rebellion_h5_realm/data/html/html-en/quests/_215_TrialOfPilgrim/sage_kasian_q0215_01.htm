Hello, my inquisitive friend.<br1>
My name is Casian, known tosome as 'the Sage of the Wastelands'.<br1>
The Elves and the Dark Elves thatyou have met have told you things that could be true or not.<br1>
The natureof the gods is not known to mankind, and even they are only one smallpart of a very big universe.<br1>
The gods each have a role to play.<br1>
Wecannot understand their intentions.<br1>
We shouldn't make things moredifficult than they are.<br1>
We must each just do the best we can and goabout our daily lives.<br1>
I hope my lecture hasn't bored you.<br1>
Take thisbook and return to *Hermit Santiago*.<br1>
After all, this whole thing washis idea to begin with.<br1>
