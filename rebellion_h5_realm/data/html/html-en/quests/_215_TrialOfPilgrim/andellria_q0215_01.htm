Did you bring a message from Santiago? In search of thetruth, are you? Your timing could not be better.<br1>
I have a favor to ask.<br1>
There is a Priestess named *Uruha* in the Neutral Zone.<br1>
She invaded thisforest with her spirits known as *Black Willows*.<br1>
You must destroy thesespirits.<br1>
The Black Willows are located near the *Waterfalls in thenorthern part of the Neutral Zone*.<br1>
After destroying them, *go to Uruhaand warn her not to come to the Elven Forest ever again.<br1>
* After you dothis we can discuss what you seek.<br1>
