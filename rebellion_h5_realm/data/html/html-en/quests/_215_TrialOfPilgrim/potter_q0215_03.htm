Nahir.<br1>
May his poor spirit rest in peace.<br1>
Thank you.<br1>
Now I will tell you Nahir's story.<br1>
He was once a faithful follower ofEinhasad.<br1>
But while he was helping his friend who was a follower ofShilen, he incurred Einhasad's wrath and was turned into a monster.<br1>
Until this day he roamed the dark underground.<br1>
Are you surprised tolearn that Einhasad, who is known as the Goddess of sacrifice and life,has in fact the opposite traits of jealousy and destruction? Of coursethe High Priests only care to mention the side of sacrifice and life.<br1>
Such is the nature of the truth you seek.<br1>
It's a bitter truth, isn't it?But that is not the end of the story.<br1>
I am sure you seek the truth aboutEva as well? In that case you should go and see *Andellia of the ElvenVillage*.<br1>
