Maphr, the goddess of abundance and prosperity?! Foolishcattle, they don't know anything! Just look at the silly Dwarves in thistown.<br1>
They are mentally unbalanced, always dashing here and there tocollect some more money.<br1>
They are simply ridiculous! Miserable creatureswho would even rip out their goddess' heart if it were worth money! Andthey don't hesitate to unearth things that should not be part of thisworld! Maphr is indeed the goddess of abundance and prosperity, but thatalso means that she is responsible for all poverty and downfalls! Whycan't you see this simple fact? They have already experienced bankruptcyonce before.<br1>
Tsk tsk.<br1>
Take this badge and take heed.<br1>
