I will never understand the Human propensity to assign avalue of right or wrong to everything, even the behavior of the gods!The worst offenders are the Priests.<br1>
There is no crime as long as weact according to our feelings, am I right? After all, we are just thegods creations.<br1>
So even if there is a crime, it is the gods' fault,not ours! Well, I've said enough.<br1>
