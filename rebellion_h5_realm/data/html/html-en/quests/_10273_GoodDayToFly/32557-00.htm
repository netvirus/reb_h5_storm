	<br> Even at my busiest, I see the sky now and again -- it's so<br>
	beautiful!<br>
	<br> Look at it! Not a cloud to be seen, a gentle breeze... Don't<br>
	you agree that it's a perfect day to fly? You don't have any idea what<br>
	I'm talking about, do you? Well, with some more experience I'm sure you<br>
	will understand.<br>
