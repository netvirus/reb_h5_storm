<br> Even at my busiest, I see the sky now and again -- it's so	beautiful!	<br> Look at it! Not a cloud to be seen, a gentle breeze.<br1>
Don't	you agree that it's a perfect day to fly? You don't have any idea what	I'm talking about, do you? Well, with some more experience I'm sure you	will understand.<br1>
