	Engineer Leko$1<br>
	<br> Any skilled adventurer in Gracia is permitted to fly.<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Hunting</font> and<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">collecting</font> are possible up there too.<br>
	<br><br>
	<br> Of course, you will need to pass a simple test to prove that<br>
	you're a match for any of the monsters you might encounter. I'm not<br>
	worried about you, though! So how about it? Would you like to take the<br>
	test?<br>
