	Engineer Leko$1<br>
	<br> When the Seed suddenly appeared in Gracia, the Aurabirds'<br>
	spirit protected them from the contamination that affected the other<br>
	creatures. They flew here to the Keucereus Alliance Base, where the<br>
	power of the Seed is weakest. I guess they wanted to survive.<br>
	<br> A few of us were interested in the origins and biology of the<br>
	Aurabirds. But more wanted to find a way to use them in the war effort.<br>
	<br> An Aurabird is big enough for even a young Orc to ride, after<br>
	all! Several of us thought they held the key to avoiding dependence on<br>
	Airships.<br>
