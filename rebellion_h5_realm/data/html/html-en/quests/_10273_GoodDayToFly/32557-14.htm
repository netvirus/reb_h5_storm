<br> How did it go? Ah, I was right about you.<br1>
I knew you would	succeed! (Ah, this one will be very useful to us)	<br> Huh? What's that? Oh, it's nothing -- just talking to myself.<br1>
Very well, let me write out your certificate.<br1>
<br> (He writes something on a paper)	<br> With this, nobody will question your right to fly.<br1>
<br> I will also give you a spellbook that describes how to	transform into your choice of Aurabird.<br1>
Use it and I think you'll be	able to fly in the Gracian skies without any help from me.<br1>
