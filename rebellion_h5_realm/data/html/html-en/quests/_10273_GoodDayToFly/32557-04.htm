	<br> If the method was easy, we would have certainly have used it<br>
	before now. We did find some ancient historical documents, but until<br>
	recently we were unable to successfully duplicate the process. Only<br>
	through the efforts of several Necromancers, the Wizards of the Ivory<br>
	Tower and Dwarven technology were we finally able to do it.<br>
	<br>Our process magically transforms a person to provide Aurabird<br>
	activity without changing the person's original shape.<br>
	<br> For it to be effective, the user must have transformation<br>
	capability and possess certain magical items.<br>
