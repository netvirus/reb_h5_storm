	<br> You must select a type of Aurabird. There are two types to<br>
	choose from.<br>
	<br> When the Aurabird was first created during the Age of the<br>
	Giants, it is said they altered several species. However, only two<br>
	types survived after the fall of the Giants.<br>
	<br> One is called the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Aurabird Falcon</font>, which has a penchant for<br>
	melee type attacks and flies very fast. The other is called the<br>
	<font color="LEVEL">Aurabird Owl</font>, which leans more towards magic<br>
	type attacks.The Aurabird Owl flies more slowly, but has easier<br>
	maneuverability.<br>
	<br> Which type do you want to be transformed into?<br>
