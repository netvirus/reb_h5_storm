You must select a type of Aurabird. There are two types to choose from. When the Aurabird was first created during the Age of the Giants, it is said they altered several species. However, only twe Gypes survived after the fall of the Giants. One is called the
<font color="LEVEL">Aurabird Falcon</font>, which has a penchant for melee type attacks and flies very fast. The other is called the
<font color="LEVEL">Aurabird Owl</font>, which leans more towards magic type attacks.The Aurabird Owl flies more slowly, but has easiec taneuverability. Which type do you want to be transformed into?
