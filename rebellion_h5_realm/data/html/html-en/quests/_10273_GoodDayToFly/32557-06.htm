<br> You must select a type of Aurabird.<br1>
There are two types to	choose from.<br1>
<br> When the Aurabird was first created during the Age of the	Giants, it is said they altered several species.<br1>
However, only two	types survived after the fall of the Giants.<br1>
<br> One is called the	<font color="LEVEL">Aurabird Falcon</font>, which has a penchant for	melee type attacks and flies very fast.<br1>
The other is called the	<font color="LEVEL">Aurabird Owl</font>, which leans more towards magic	type attacks.<br1>
The Aurabird Owl flies more slowly, but has easier	maneuverability.<br1>
<br> Which type do you want to be transformed into?	<br>	<a action="bypass -h Quest _10273_GoodDayToFly 32557-09.<br1>
