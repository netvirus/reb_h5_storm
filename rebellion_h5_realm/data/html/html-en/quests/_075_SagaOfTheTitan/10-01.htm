<font color="36DC25">Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
You hear a disturbance as you approach the tablet.<br1>
Sounds of rocks crashing, and the roar of a warrior resisting them! Nofear of the most awesome opponent, eager for death in battle! They sayOrcs were stronger back in the day and I'm inclined to believe them.<br1>
ButI also know that their fiery blood hasn't changed! Is that actuallythe tablet? The sound of swordplay is carried on the wind.<br1>
