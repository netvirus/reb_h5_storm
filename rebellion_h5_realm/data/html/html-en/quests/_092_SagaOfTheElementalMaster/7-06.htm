<font color="36DC25">!Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
The Tablet of Vision begins to illuminate the roomand engulfs you in its wake.<br1>
Thunderous chanting clogs your mind and yetgives you understand of something.<br1>
something that cannot beunderstood! You hear a familiar woman's voice whispering again.<br1>
ArdenCastle Town.<br1>
there is Summoner Radyss, who has a bad cough.<br1>
Helifts up his face and looks into your eyes, motioning you to cometoward.<br1>
Summoner Radyss has the stone! The vision disappears slowly, andthe tablet goes dark.<br1>
