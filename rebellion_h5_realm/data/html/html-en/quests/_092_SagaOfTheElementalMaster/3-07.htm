When you responded to the third tablet, yousensed the location of the next Stone of Commune, didn't you? At thattime, you should have seen me.<br1>
I also felt your existence.<br1>
! Hack.<br1>
What you sensed is this small piece of stone.<br1>
This is the fragment ofthe fourth Stone of Commune.<br1>
However, you must find the other part andcombine them in order to form a working Stone of Commune.<br1>
The rest ofthe Stone of Commune is called Divine Stone of Wisdom and worshippedas an idol by the barbarians in this area.<br1>
According to what I'velearned, the Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos tribes enshrine the stone.<br1>
To get this stone, you must gain their trust.<br1>
Hack.<br1>
However, it willnever be easy, because they are wild and warlike tribes.<br1>
