The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by brightlights.<br1>
While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start toacquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousandsreading scriptures in the background.<br1>
You now realize the truth of theworld and yet understand nothing.<br1>
There is a vision of a beautifulblonde woman and a knight with black armor.<br1>
The vision disappears.<br1>
Thelocation of the next commune is gradually becoming clear.<br1>
A visionappears.<br1>
The sixth Tablet of Vision hidden in the wilds.<br1>
Standingbefore the sixth tablet is a beast with red eyes and sharp fangs!.<br1>
andthe Stone of Commune, held in the mouth of the beast, emits a dimlight.<br1>
In an instant, the images disappear and then the stone goescompletely dark.<br1>
