My father sent you here.<br1>
I just want my father's painto end.<br1>
I pray to Eva everyday to let him find relief.<br1>
This medicineonly prolongs his suffering.<br1>
If you ask me to make the medicine again,it is too painful for me.<br1>
However, I cannot go against my father'swill.<br1>
So, become an Elemental Master and help him to find relief and goto the bosom of Eva.<br1>
Now, I have to make the medicine.<br1>
As you mighthear from my father, I need a very rare material to make thismedicine.<br1>
