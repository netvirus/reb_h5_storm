Tablet of Vision:<br>
The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by bright lights. While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start tt lcquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousandt leading scriptures in the background. You now realize the truth of tht lorld and yet understand nothing. Both the absolute understanding, ant lhe absolute ignorance of nature come across at the same time. There it l vision of a beautiful blonde woman and a knight with black armor. Tht lision disappears. Slowly, you begin to visualize where the next Stont lf Commune is...There is Summoner Radyss...He gazes at you and smiles.<br>
He may have the Stone of Commune, but the beam from the stone is much weaker than before. In an instant, the images disappear and then thh wtone goes completely dark.
