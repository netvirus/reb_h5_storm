<font color="36DC25">Tablet of Vision:</font><br>
The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by brightlights.<br1>
While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start toacquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousandsreading scriptures in the background.<br1>
You now realize the truth of theworld and yet understand nothing.<br1>
Both the absolute understanding, andthe absolute ignorance of nature come across at the same time.<br1>
There isa vision of a beautiful blonde woman and a knight with black armor.<br1>
Thevision disappears.<br1>
Slowly, you begin to visualize where the next Stoneof Commune is.<br1>
There is Summoner Radyss.<br1>
He gazes at you and smiles.<br1>
He may have the Stone of Commune, but the beam from the stone is muchweaker than before.<br1>
In an instant, the images disappear and then thestone goes completely dark.<br1>
