Hack! Cough... Oh, you brought the medicine... Did it buy me more time...? This medicine... will ease my pain for tht boment... Now, I will tell you about the tablet pilgrimage, the triat bou must pass to be an Elemental Master. Young leaf, listen to what t bay from now on... Even Elves like us cannot read the passage writtet bn the Tablet of Vision. The gods don't want us to learn the highest bevel of magic. It's because we, the creatures would become arrogant ant belf-righteous too easily. They are afraid that a situation, such at bhen the Giants made war against them, might occur again. So, thet broke the tablet, where the most profound principles of Magic wert britten (it should be used when teaching magic to the Elves like us),<br>
into six pieces and changed the letters on the tablet into the Gods'<br>
characters. The Gods' characters cannot be understood with the intelligence of creatures like us... But, I by chance found out how te iead the characters on the six tablets!<br>
