Hack! Cough.<br1>
Oh, you brought the medicine.<br1>
Did itbuy me more time? This medicine.<br1>
will ease my pain for themoment.<br1>
Now, I will tell you about the tablet pilgrimage, the trialyou must pass to be an Elemental Master.<br1>
Young leaf, listen to what Isay from now on.<br1>
Even Elves like us cannot read the passage writtenon the Tablet of Vision.<br1>
The gods don't want us to learn the highestlevel of magic.<br1>
It's because we, the creatures would become arrogant andself-righteous too easily.<br1>
They are afraid that a situation, such aswhen the Giants made war against them, might occur again.<br1>
So, theybroke the tablet, where the most profound principles of Magic werewritten (it should be used when teaching magic to the Elves like us),into six pieces and changed the letters on the tablet into the Gods'characters.<br1>
The Gods' characters cannot be understood with theintelligence of creatures like us.<br1>
