Rumor has it that the thieves are very nimble.<br1>
If you want to deal with them, you must increase your agility to their level.<br1>
That is probably why Bezique said that he would acknowledge you as a Rogue if you catch those thieves.<br1>
Great agility is the main talent you must have to be a Rogue. Before you handle those thieves, I must test you to fathom your agility. So be alert and listen.<br1>
If you pass this test, you will be able to catch the thieves easily.<br>
