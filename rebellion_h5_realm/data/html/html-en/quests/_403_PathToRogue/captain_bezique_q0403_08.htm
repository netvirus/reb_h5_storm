<font color="FFFF00">Captain Bezique:</font><br>
I understand that you have received a "Horseshoe of Light" from Neti.<br1>
You must be more talented than you look, but if Neti gave you this, she has faith in your abilities.<br1>
So let's start going after those thieves in earnest.<br1>
This is the *Most Wanted List.* I'm sure you can tell from reading the list, but your opponents are called the *Cat's Eye Bandits.*<br1>
They're named for their leader, nicknamed Cat's Eye for whatever reason, and are all of the Ol Mahum race. According to my scouts, their base is located near the *Abandoned Camp* where the runaway Ol Mahum troops pitch camp.<br1>
If you don't know how to get there, go and ask Guard Praga. *Use the bow and dagger that Neti gave you to capture the Cat's Eye gang in one stroke.<br1>
And bring back the 4 types of items that were stolen from the people of this village.*<br1>
Should be a good test of your mettle.<br1>
Good luck!<br>
