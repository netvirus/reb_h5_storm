Those thieves are surely part of the Ol Mahum straggler troops.<br1>
The Ol Mahum foreign troops that Gracia hired years ago during the Gracia War, are still pitching runaway troop campsites beyond the mountain north of the village.<br1>
One more thing. There is someone who can help you catch those thieves.<br1>
There is a woman named *Neti* who lives in this village... Actually, she was once a chivalrous robber.<br1>
She sure kept this kingdom's corrupt aristocracy in fear, heh heh.<br1>
She's also famous as a treasure hunter who found rare and valuable treasure in many ruins.<br1>
You might get a cold reception if you go asking for her help, so take this letter with you.<br1>
She owes me a debt, so she will surely help you.<br>
