May the blessings of the starlight be with you.<br1>
You haverecovered *Talin's Spear*! Thank you so much for your trouble.<br1>
Now thatwe both have the *Grail of Purity* and the *Talin's Spear* we can setoff in search for the *Water of Life*.<br1>
But it is impossible without thebiggest sacrifice and the greatest sorrow.<br1>
We must pierce the *Unicornof Eva* which can be called the guardian of our forest with the *Talin'sSpear* and collect its *tears* in the *Grail of Purity*.<br1>
That is the*Water of Life* itself.<br1>
After all, in order to recover the life of the*Mother Tree*, we must deprive the life of our dearest Eva'sincarnation, the unicorn.<br1>
Now do you see what you have to do? May theGoddess forgive us for our deed.<br1>
