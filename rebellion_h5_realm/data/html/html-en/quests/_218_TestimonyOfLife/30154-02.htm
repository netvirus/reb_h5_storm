Ignorance and greed is not exclusive to Humans.<br1>
Wealso should watch out for such faults.<br1>
The reason I called for young*Elves* such as you, is because the mother of all *Elves*, our *MotherTree*, is dying.<br1>
We should prevent this from happening, at all costs.<br1>
This is a big trial for all Elves.<br1>
