The *Pure Mithril Cup*.<br1>
It is indeed a masterpiece.<br1>
Sometimesthe Dwarves are worth themselves.<br1>
To perform the ceremony of turning aMithril Cup into a *Grail of Purity*, we need *Stardust*.<br1>
It is thesilvery powder which is said to be sprinkled by the spirits of starlightat night.<br1>
The skills to gather it is handed down only among those whohave now turned into Dark Elves.<br1>
Unfortunately we need the Dark Elves toobtain the Stardust.<br1>
Dark Elves, our dark shadow.<br1>
Although they areunforgivable creatures, in order for us to survive, and also for thesurvival of all the forests in this land.<br1>
We need their helpabsolutely.<br1>
Go to the *Dark Elves Initiation Altar* and meet a *Shamancalled Arkenia*.<br1>
She knows how to make the *Stardust*.<br1>
I shall write youa letter.<br1>
But I wonder if the hostile Dark Elves will give us helpwithout any problems.<br1>
