Ten years ago, I was really shocked to find out thatthe *Mother Tree* was dying gradually.<br1>
I have worked hard to find outthe reason.<br1>
Was it because of the poisonous wind blowing from the *Seaof Spores*.<br1>
Or was it because the rampage that the spirits of naturemade the earth energy unstable.<br1>
And what about the possibility thatthe Sorcerers of the Dark Elves contaminated the river which the *MotherTree* feeds on?.<br1>
I looked into every possibility but could not findout the reason.<br1>
Perhaps it is the *Mother Tree* itself which is dyingbecause it couldn't stand the disappointment of this unjust world.<br1>
Butwe must not lose hope.<br1>
There must be a way! There must be.<br1>
A way torevive the dying *Mother Tree*.<br1>
