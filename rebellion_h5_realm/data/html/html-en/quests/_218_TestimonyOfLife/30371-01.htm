How is the Hierarch? He must be constantly worried sick aboutthe future of our race.<br1>
we should do all we can to lighten his burden.<br1>
My sisters and I have been exploring many methods to revive the dying*Mother Tree*, but all our efforts have failed.<br1>
But still there is hope.<br1>
According to the legends passed down from the Guardian of the MotherTree, there is a *Water of Life* that can cure all diseases and poisons.<br1>
It is said that the purest powers of life, used by the Gods to createall the living creatures on this land, is contained in that water.<br1>
Evahas entrusted this *Water of Life* to the 'Guard of Tears.<br1>
' I cannottell you yet who he is, but to obtain the *Water of Life* from thatperson is the *Test of Life* that you must take.<br1>
It is something that wemust do in order to survive, but it is sad that we cannot avoid makinghuge sacrifices for it.<br1>
