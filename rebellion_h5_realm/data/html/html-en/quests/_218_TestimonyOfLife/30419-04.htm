Oh, so price is no object is it? Hmm.<br1>
.<br1>
Then how aboutthis? I cannot tell you the recipe, but if you bring me *Andariel'sBook* that you Elves of Light think so precious, I will give you some*Stardust*.<br1>
The Book was actually a part of 'Kaisha's Revelation' whichcontained Shilen's secret, but the followers of Einhasad edited it fortheir own purposes.<br1>
This book made by the hypocrites of the Light iscertainly corrupted, but perhaps I could find some clues about Kaisha'sRevelation.<br1>
As far as I know, *Andariel's Book* is in the *Temple ofEinhasad in Gludin* .<br1>
I care not how you get it, just bring it to me.<br1>
Produce the book and I will give you some *Stardust* .<br1>
I swear by theGaze of Abyss that this promise will be kept.<br1>
