Brother, did you come to see the *Andariel's Book* ?Did you come to contemplate on the goodness of Einhasad contained in thebible? May the protection of the Goddess accompany you in your journeyto seek the truth.<br1>
But as days go by, there are more and more darkforces that are trying to destroy this precious book containing thetenet of light.<br1>
That is why we can't take the bible outside,unfortunately.<br1>
I hate to turn down the request of a brother, but neithercan I disobey the rules of the religion.<br1>
But don't be too disappointed,yet.<br1>
We are making copies of the Endariel so that many people can getaccess to the truth it contains.<br1>
Even at this moment, scores of Priestsare copying each and every single letter of the bible on to lamb's skin.<br1>
The completed ones will be sent to the guardians of the *Mother Tree*and the Einhasad shrines all around.<br1>
I hope you can participate in thecopying process.<br1>
