When you overcome this difficulty and come back to meas a more mature person, I will acknowledge that you are ready to forhigher education and thereby offer you the *Mark of Life*.<br1>
More than anytime, we need to respect mother nature with our hearts, appreciate allliving creatures and have sympathy for ourselves.<br1>
Perhaps just as thevery first guardian had sacrificed herself, we might need to sacrifice alot of things at the cost of overcoming this difficulty.<br1>
Right now,*Hierarch Asteros* is calling back the young Elves to the *ElvenForest*.<br1>
Your trial has begun.<br1>
*I will give you this letter, so hurry tosee the hierarch in your hometown.<br1>
* May the blessing of the starlightsbrighten your way.<br1>
