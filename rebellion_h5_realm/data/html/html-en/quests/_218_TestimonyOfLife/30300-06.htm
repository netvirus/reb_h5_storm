First I will need a very pure, specially-madevarnish to refine *pure Mithril*.<br1>
Using normal varnish to refine *pureMithril* will destroy it.<br1>
This special varnish is derived from thesecretions of giant ants.<br1>
You will find these ants in the *Wastelands ofGludio*.<br1>
There are hundreds of giant ants in the underground there.<br1>
Kill only *ant soldiers* and collect the *liquid from their body* in abottle.<br1>
20 bottles will be enough.<br1>
And last, we will need *wyrm claws*.<br1>
Carving a Mithril surface requires a strong and sharp knife, normalknives and chisels are not suitable.<br1>
I need a chisel made from *wyrmclaws*.<br1>
Please get me 20 unbroken claws.<br1>
So, the 3 materials we needare: *Pure Mithril ore*, *ant soldier liquid* and *wyrm claws*.<br1>
