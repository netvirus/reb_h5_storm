It was the *leto lizardmen* who wrested the spearfrom the lake fairies.<br1>
It is said that the Shamans and Chiefs of theirgroup broke the spear into many pieces and divided them amongthemselves.<br1>
*The spear was divided into six pieces: the blade, theshaft, and four jewels that adorned the handle.<br1>
*.<br1>
These wretchedcreatures are taking the pieces to the *Immortal Plateau* to throw theminto the lava cave to destroy the spear forever.<br1>
This hostility is nottypical of the lizardmen.<br1>
I am certain that someone is controllingthem.<br1>
But the most important matter is the recovery of the spear.<br1>
Mybrother, I beseech you.<br1>
Find the *Shamans and Chiefs of the Letolizardman * , and recover all the pieces of the spear that they havetaken from us.<br1>
Time is of the essence.<br1>
May Sayha of the Winds guide yourway.<br1>
