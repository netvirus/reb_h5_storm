In the past, we Elves had the knowledge to make the holy grail,but during the war with Humans, the High Artisan Elves who kept thesecrets of Mithril and platinum lost their lives, and the secrets of thegrail were gone with them as well.<br1>
Therefore we need the help of othertribes to make the grail.<br1>
First of all we need to carefully craft a *cupmade of pure mithril*.<br1>
*Pure mithril* is a perfect mithril whichcontains no other elements except for itself, and there are only a fewArtisans throughout the continent who can make it.<br1>
Go to *BlacksmithPushkin of Giran Castle Town*.<br1>
Although he is a materialistic Dwarf whoonly knows of money and jewels, he is an outstanding Artisan who knowsthe techniques to handle the *pure Mithril*.<br1>
Take this illustrated bookand show it to him.<br1>
And ask him to make the grail exactly how it lookslike in the book.<br1>
I suppose he will ask a price for that, since he is aDwarf.<br1>
Try as much as you can to satisfy his wishes.<br1>
I shall be waitingfor your return.<br1>
May the blessings of the starlight be with you.<br1>
