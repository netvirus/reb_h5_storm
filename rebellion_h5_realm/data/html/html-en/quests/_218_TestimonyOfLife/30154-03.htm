Of course the Humans are witty and sometimes can bevery brave.<br1>
But at the same time they are ignorant and greedy.<br1>
For sure,they will open a new future but we Elves must always watch out for thepossibility of that future as a dark one.<br1>
The reason I called foryoung *Elves* such as you, is because the mother of all *Elves*, our*Mother Tree* is dying.<br1>
We should prevent this from happening, at allcosts.<br1>
This is a big trial for all Elves.<br1>
