*Pure Mithril*.<br1>
! It isn't a material that justanyone can handle.<br1>
The skill of refining and crafting *pure Mithril* ishanded down to selected Artisans even in my esteemed *Black Moru Guild*.<br1>
However it is very difficult to get *pure Mithril* nowadays.<br1>
At one time*Pure Mithril* could be found in the mine field that we Dwarves operatedlong ago, but it is very rare since we stopped the operation due to thearrival of earthworm.<br1>
However there is one place that we can find it.<br1>
