The precious copy of the scripture, you haven't yetgiven it to the person you ought to give it to.<br1>
I know to some extent.<br1>
That this scripture is needed to save the *Mother Tree*, which is indanger of falling into the hands of our enemies right now.<br1>
Don'thesitate to do what you ought to do.<br1>
May the blessings of the Goddess bewith you.<br1>
