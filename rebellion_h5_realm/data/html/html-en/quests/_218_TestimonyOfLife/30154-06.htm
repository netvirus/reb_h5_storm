In the past, the first guardian sacrificed herselfto give life to the *Mother Tree*.<br1>
But now there are fewer Elves thanever.<br1>
We can't push someone to sacrifice themself either since wecan't afford to lose anyone.<br1>
And most of all, I shall not see somethingso painful ever again in my life.<br1>
Fortunately, there is another way tobring back life to the *Mother Tree*.<br1>
It is the *Water of Life*mentioned in the world-creation legend by the Giants.<br1>
The legendarywater which flowed out from the holy fountain of Eva and gave birth tothe first living thing in the beginning of times.<br1>
The *Water of Life*has been flowing along all rivers and streams since then and gave lifeto earth.<br1>
But ever since the great flood inundated the land it has beencontaminated.<br1>
And since then, we haven't been able to see the *Water ofLife*.<br1>
At least we believed so.<br1>
For the past thousands of years.<br1>
Wedid not know before, but we can still find the *Water of Life*.<br1>
Thetears in the eyes of the purest being, that is the *Water of Life*.<br1>
Think over what I said just now.<br1>
