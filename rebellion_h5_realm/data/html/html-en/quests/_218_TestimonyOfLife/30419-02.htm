So what if the Mother Tree dies, what is that to us? You Elvesof Light turned your backs on us and treated us as outcasts.<br1>
We wereobliged to sever our relationship with our beloved forest and earth andtake refuge in the shadows! Consequently we are not dependent on the*Mother Tree* as you are, and now we are the ones with true freedom.<br1>
Whynot join us in the shadows, and escape the deceptive clutches of the*Mother Tree*? The death of the *Mother Tree* means nothing to us.<br1>
