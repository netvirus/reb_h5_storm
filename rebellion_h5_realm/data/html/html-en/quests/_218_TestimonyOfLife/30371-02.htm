Before finding the *Water of Life*, we need to prepare twothings ahead of time.<br1>
They are the *Grail of Purity* and *Talin'sSpear*.<br1>
*Talin's Spear* used to be kept by the Elves living in InnadrilLake, but because of the incident this time we decided to move it here.<br1>
As for you, you must find the *Grail of Purity* to be used forcontaining the *Water of Life*.<br1>
This magic grail which has the power toclear all impure objects is even said to be able to purify deadlypoisons such as the belladonna into clear water.<br1>
The reason why we needit is because if we pour the *Water of Life* in a plain vessel, it losesits strength.<br1>
To preserve its strength, we need to contain it in the*Grail of Purity*.<br1>
