Thank you for your help, brother of forest.<br1>
Take this.<br1>
It is the *copy of Andariel's Book* .<br1>
You didn't say so, but I alreadyknew.<br1>
That this bible is needed to save the *Mother Tree*, which is indanger of falling into the hands of our enemies.<br1>
But I have faith inthat the Goddess of harmony and life will lead you to the right way.<br1>
Never forget to listen to the blowing winds, the trickling of waters andthe whispers from the starlight.<br1>
The Goddess will always be with us.<br1>
