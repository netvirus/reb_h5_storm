Thank you very much, brother of forest.<br1>
Then I shalltell you what you can help us with.<br1>
Right now, we are short of ink andpens which are used for making the copies.<br1>
To make the ink, we need the*Spider Ichor*.<br1>
You can extract them from the *spiders of CrumaMarshlands* .<br1>
And for the pens we need the *Harpy's Down*.<br1>
I would begrateful if you could bring *20 of them, each* .<br1>
If you bring me all ofthese, I shall give you a copy of the book in return.<br1>
