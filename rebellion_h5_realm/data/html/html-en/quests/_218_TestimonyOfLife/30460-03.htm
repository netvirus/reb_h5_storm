The *Mother Tree*.<br1>
Mother of all forests and Elves.<br1>
The main body of the Elven tribe.<br1>
Long ago.<br1>
Thanks to the sacrificeof the very first guardian, the *Mother Tree* could live once again inthe land filled with dead bodies.<br1>
She saved the tree by killing herselfand becoming one with the dying tree.<br1>
Until this day there remains hershape in the stem of the *Mother Tree*.<br1>
Her noble spirit which dared tosacrifice herself, and her love for the tribe.<br1>
That should never beforgotten.<br1>
Thanks to her sacrifice the tree could stretch its brancheshigh up to the sky and its roots deep into the ground and finally bloomlife, once again.<br1>
However.<br1>
Now once more.<br1>
The tree is dying.<br1>
Thisis a great difficulty which our lives depend on.<br1>
Without the *MotherTree* we cannot exist either.<br1>
To overcome this difficulty, we need thehelp and sacrifice of young Elves like you.<br1>
