Ismell? He passed here a few days ago with pale face.<br1>
These days the undead have been exceptionally active so I tried todissuade him from going into the execution place, but he refused tolisten to me saying that he can't afford to lose a precious thing.<br1>
Afterwards a terrible shriek could be heard and he never returned sincethen.<br1>
I suppose he turned into one of those '*nameless souls*' wanderingabout the Execution Ground.<br1>
