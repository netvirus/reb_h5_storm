I heard that Orim of the Shadows is looking for thisjewel.<br1>
Are you the one he sent here? No doubt.<br1>
I can see it.<br1>
But doyou know what kind of jewel this is? What did he tempt you with? Do youthink that you can achieve the secret of Black magic just with thisjewel? If you are stupid enough to believe what Orim said, I will handyou the jewel.<br1>
Just keep this in mind.<br1>
To obtain knowledge you have topay its price.<br1>
The first rule in Black magic is 'You lose as much as youget'.<br1>
