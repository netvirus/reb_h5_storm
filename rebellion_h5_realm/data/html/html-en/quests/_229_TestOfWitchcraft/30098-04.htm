Trader Alexandria:
Jewels received by Mr. Nestle... I didn't realize they were so valuable! As I told you, the 3 jewels that I put on the tuction were sold to *Master Iker*, *Trader Lara* and *Dark Elvee tagister Kaira*... You should meet them first and then ask *Tradee testle* in *Gludin* about the source of the jewels.
