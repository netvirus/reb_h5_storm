<font color="FF8000">Fisher Evert:</font><br>
When I was young, I also dreamed of traveling the worldand seeking adventure.<br1>
But eventually I fell in love with a woman andbecame a fisherman.<br1>
Now I am retired, with no care but to cast my lineon a peaceful afternoon.<br1>
This is not a bad life at all, is it? Pleaseremove that sword.<br1>
The reflecting sunlight is scaring the fish.<br1>
