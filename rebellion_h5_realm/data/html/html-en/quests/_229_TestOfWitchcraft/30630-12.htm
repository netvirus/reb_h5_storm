Anyone who ever owned the jewels all turned intohorrible 'undead'? It must be because the power of Black magic dwellingin the jewel drains the life energy of the owner.<br1>
Normally, one wouldthrow away or destroy the jewel in such occasion, but it is strange thatthe owners would never let go of the jewel.<br1>
I suspect that there must besome mysterious bewildering spell on it.<br1>
Or else it might have somekind of will affecting it.<br1>
Perhaps the subject of the will might berelated to the secret of this box.<br1>
There's no way we can find out unlesswe open it.<br1>
All we need to do now, is insert the jewels in each holeaccording to its order.<br1>
