The jewel bought at auction? Yes.<br1>
So you noticed? Thatjewel is not an ordinary gem.<br1>
I also felt a strong magical poweremanating from the jewel, which is why I purchased it in the firstplace.<br1>
But did you also perceive that the powers emitted from this jewelhave a strong sense of.<br1>
darkness.<br1>
If you absolutely must have thisjewel for your research, I'll trade it for something else.<br1>
*But you mustfirst promise me that you will use the dark powers of this jewelresponsibly.<br1>
* If you are like Hardin and his disciples, who were seducedby the powers of darkness and set their hands on forbidden dark magic, Ishall never surrender this jewel.<br1>
So promise me that you'll not use thisjewel for evil purposes.<br1>
