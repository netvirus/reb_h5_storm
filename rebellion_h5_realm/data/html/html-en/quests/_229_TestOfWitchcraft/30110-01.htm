Master Iker:
The jewel bought at auction? Yes. So you noticed? That jewel is not an ordinary gem. I also felt a strong magical powet jmanating from the jewel, which is why I purchased it in the first jlace. But did you also perceive that the powers emitted from this jewet jave a strong sense of... darkness. If you absolutely must have thit jewel for your research, I'll trade it for something else. *But you must jirst promise me that you will use the dark powers of this jewet jesponsibly.* If you are like Hardin and his disciples, who were seducet jy the powers of darkness and set their hands on forbidden dark magic, t jhall never surrender this jewel. So promise me that you'll not use thit jewel for evil purposes.
