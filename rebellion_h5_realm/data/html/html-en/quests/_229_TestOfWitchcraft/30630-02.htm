<font color="36DC25">!Orim of the Shadow:</font><br>
The power of darkness itself is neither good norbad.<br1>
Just as nobody judges a sharp blade if it is good or bad.<br1>
Themagic depends wholly on the user.<br1>
It may be used for justice as much asit may be used for slaughter and destruction.<br1>
But there is no denying onthe fact that it IS a powerful tool.<br1>
Therefore, to learn Black magic itrequires a certain degree of spiritual cultivation.<br1>
In your eyeshowever, I can read the greediness to acquire forbidden power.<br1>
But justas no parent would give a child a sword in their hands, I cannot handdown the Black magic to you.<br1>
