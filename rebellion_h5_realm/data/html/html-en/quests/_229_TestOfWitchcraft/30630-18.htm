Sword of Binding! And the Soul-trap Crystal! Youacquired the 2 holy objects! Now, if only we find out where Zeruelis.<br1>
! My searching spell wasn't exactly a success, so I couldn't findout Zeruel's location exactly, but I have a clue of where he might be.<br1>
Ithink he is now in the northern part of Dion Castle Town, *somewherenear the Floran Village*.<br1>
It is likely that he is *dwelling inside ahuman body*.<br1>
When Zeruel reveals himself, fight him and kill his bodywith all your might.<br1>
*But, remember.<br1>
The last stroke must be done withSword of Binding*.<br1>
Then you must seal his spirit with the Soul-trapCrystal.<br1>
You can do it.<br1>
Please hurry.<br1>
