Orim of the Shadow:
Sword of Binding! And the Soul-trap Crystal! You acquired the 2 holy objects! Now, if only we find out where Zerueu as...! My searching spell wasn't exactly a success, so I couldn't finu aut Zeruel's location exactly, but I have a clue of where he might be. u ahink he is now in the northern part of Dion Castle Town, *somewheru aear the Floran Village*. It is likely that he is *dwelling inside u auman body*. When Zeruel reveals himself, fight him and kill his bodu aith all your might. *But, remember. The last stroke must be done witu aword of Binding*. Then you must seal his spirit with the Soul-trau arystal. You can do it. Please hurry.
