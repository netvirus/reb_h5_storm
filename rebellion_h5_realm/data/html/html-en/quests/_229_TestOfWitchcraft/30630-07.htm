Then take a look at this.<br1>
It is something that Ifound in the Cruma Tower one day.<br1>
A cube made out of a mysterioussubstance.<br1>
They say that the Wizards of the ancient kingdom called it a'spirit container' because it could hold a dead person's spirit in it.<br1>
That is how they tried to keep all the great scholars and philosophers'knowledge and experience.<br1>
This box right here contains the spirit ofMagus Aklantoth in the days of Elmoreden.<br1>
Recently, he woke up from his1,000-year sleep.<br1>
It is faint, but clear enough.<br1>
I hear his voice,calling me.<br1>
He has promised to teach me all he knows in magic if Ifree his spirit from the box.<br1>
You can always rely on a Wizard's word.<br1>
So, what we need to do is open this box, and we'll have access to thesecrets of black magic from the age of the empire.<br1>
