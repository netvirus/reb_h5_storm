My records are very detailed.<br1>
Three jewels were puton auction.<br1>
There were originally 6 pieces in the set, But the otherswere not in the set and were sold separately.<br1>
The first jewel was soldto *Master Iker*.<br1>
He is one of the members of the Mages' Guild of thisvillage.<br1>
The second jewel was sold to *Trader Lars from Dion CastleTown*.<br1>
And the last jewel was sold to a *Dark Elf lady named 'Kaira'*.<br1>
She is one of the few Dark Elves who live in this village.<br1>
I'm not sure,but you seem to be in something of a hurry.<br1>
If need be, I will lend youmy account book.<br1>
You should meet the owners first, and ask Trader Nestleof Gludin about the origin of the jewels.<br1>
