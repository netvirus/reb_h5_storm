You mean the *Jewel of Aklantoth*.<br1>
I asked TraderAlexandria of Giran to sell it at auction.<br1>
There are 6 jewels altogetherin one set, but unfortunately we have only acquired 3 of them so far.<br1>
What a pity! I would have been able to sell them in an even higher priceif I had the whole collection.<br1>
