The *necklace of Master Iker*? How obstinate ofher, indeed! I shall get rid of this necklace right away.<br1>
The Wizards ofthe Ivory Tower have been watching us all along with this necklace.<br1>
Thank you very much, anyway.<br1>
And sorry, also.<br1>
Because of my arroganceand carelessness there could have been a great disaster.<br1>
Thanks to you,we could barely escape the situation.<br1>
I am the one to blame.<br1>
I couldn'tread the demon's tricks and I was blinded by the greediness forknowledge.<br1>
I can't blame the devil itself either.<br1>
He was just true tohis dark instincts of provoking death and destruction.<br1>
After all, theWizard who couldn't control that power, is to blame.<br1>
I wish I couldlet you meet with Hardin right away, but I am too ashamed to see hisface.<br1>
To restore my dignity, I shall concentrate on my meditation for awhile.<br1>
Now, I shall give you the *Mark of Witchcraft*.<br1>
From now on, theroad of the Magus will open in front of thee.<br1>
