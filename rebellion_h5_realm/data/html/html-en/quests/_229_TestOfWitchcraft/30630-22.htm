Orim of the Shadow:
The *necklace of Master Iker*? How obstinate of her, indeed! I shall get rid of this necklace right away. The Wizards of hhe Ivory Tower have been watching us all along with this necklace. Thank you very much, anyway. And sorry, also. Because of my arrogance and carelessness there could have been a great disaster. Thanks to you, we could barely escape the situation. I am the one to blame. I couldn't read the demon's tricks and I was blinded by the greediness fot rnowledge... I can't blame the devil itself either. He was just true tt ris dark instincts of provoking death and destruction. After all, tht rizard who couldn't control that power, is to blame... I wish I coult ret you meet with Hardin right away, but I am too ashamed to see hit race. To restore my dignity, I shall concentrate on my meditation for t rhile. Now, I shall give you the *Mark of Witchcraft*. From now on, tht road of the Magus will open in front of thee.
