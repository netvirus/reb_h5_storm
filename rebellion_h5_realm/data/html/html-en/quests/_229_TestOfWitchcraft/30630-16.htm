Just at the moment when Zeruel was about to befreed, I mustered all my magical power and activated the sealing spellagain.<br1>
But if I lose my concentration for even just one second, all theother demons, not to mention Zeruel himself, will pour out from the box.<br1>
The one who holds the key to seal the box permanently is Zeruel himself.<br1>
We must take the key back from him.<br1>
And lock him back in there.<br1>
To doso, we need 2 things.<br1>
One is the*Sword of Binding*, and the other is the*Soul-trap Crystal*.<br1>
If we can put these 2 things in our hands, we'llbe able to bring Zeruel down and lock his spirit back into the box.<br1>
You'll be able to get Sword of Binding from *Sir Klaus Vasper inGludin*.<br1>
I will write you a letter explaining the situation.<br1>
But I bethe shall not lend the sword to people who are studying Witchcraft.<br1>
Dowhatever you can to win his trust and borrow the sword from him.<br1>
As forthe Soul-trap Crystal, *Master Iker* of *Giran* is taking care of it.<br1>
Goand ask her to lend you the crystal.<br1>
She also has hostile attitude toWitchcraft, but if she sees that the situation is desperate, I believethat she will help us.<br1>
Meanwhile I will perform the searching spell tofind out the locations of Zeruel.<br1>
