And he filled his pockets with the treasures of the ancientkingdom which he found in the area where the fierce battle took place.<br1>
Most of the treasures were disposed of at the shop, but there was somequarrel over a few jewels which were very valuable.<br1>
I coudn't stand thequarrel between colleagues anymore so I confiscated 3 out of 6 jewelsand sent them to Lars for supervision.<br1>
But nevertheless, an accidentbroke out.<br1>
Three of the members who were quarrelling about the jewelschopped off their colleagues' heads and ran way with the remaining 3jewels.<br1>
Bastards! Killing their own colleagues just for money!!! I wasin such despair and asked Lars to dispose the rest of the jewels, aswell.<br1>
I sent the searching troops to punish the betrayers, but to myamazement it was reported that all 3 of them were killed after fightingamong themselves.<br1>
But then, before the eyes of the searching troops, the3 of them revived as undead.<br1>
If you wish to find them try and searchamong the skull troops near the Wasteland.<br1>
