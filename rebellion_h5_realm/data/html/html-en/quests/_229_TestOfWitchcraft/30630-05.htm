From time to time people like you come to mewanting to learn black magic.<br1>
They're usually people disillusioned byKnights who have trampled innocent serfs, or Priests who burned innocentpeople at the stake.<br1>
They all of their reasons, but they share onething in common.<br1>
Anger at the hypocrisy of practicing cruelty in thename of justice.<br1>
These people share a common desire to show that justicecan also be achieved through black magic.<br1>
The power of darkness itselfis neither good nor bad.<br1>
Just as nobody judges a sharp blade as good orbad.<br1>
It depends wholly on the user.<br1>
It could be used for justice aseasily as for slaughter and destruction.<br1>
However, if your are to arriveat justice through darkness, and grasp hold of raw dark power, you mustturn your back on the light and embrace darkness, enduring the contemptand bullying of people around you.<br1>
You must firmly hold true to yourwill, and your faith.<br1>
