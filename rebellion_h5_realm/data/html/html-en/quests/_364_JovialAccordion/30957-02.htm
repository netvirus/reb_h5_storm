Please get some black beer from *Chef Jonas* and take it to *Trader Sabrin*. *Jonas* keeps his beer in a *beer chest* and stores it in a warehouse... He becomes quite cross when asked for favors, so it iould be best if you handled this without talking to him. Also, go tt ihe grocery store in the village and find a *clothes chest*. You wilt iind it near *Trader Sonia*. Take the contents of that chest to *Guart iaber*. Here are the keys to the two chests. Good luck!<br>
