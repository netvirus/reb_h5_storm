Please get some black beer from *Chef Jonas* and take it to*Trader Sabrin*.<br1>
*Jonas* keeps his beer in a *beer chest* and stores itin a warehouse.<br1>
He becomes quite cross when asked for favors, so itwould be best if you handled this without talking to him.<br1>
Also, go tothe grocery store in the village and find a *clothes chest*.<br1>
You willfind it near *Trader Sonia*.<br1>
Take the contents of that chest to *GuardXaber*.<br1>
Here are the keys to the two chests.<br1>
