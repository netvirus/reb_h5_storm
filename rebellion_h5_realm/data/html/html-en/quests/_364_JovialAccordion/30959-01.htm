Some time ago, I heard *Bard Swan* playing hismandolin.<br1>
His skills are quite impressive.<br1>
I wish he would play a duetwith me, but for some reason, whenever he sees me he avoids me.<br1>
I hateto ask you to do this, but would you go see *Swan* and tell him that Iwant to play a duet with him? Of course you will be rewarded for youreffort.<br1>
