Were you sent by the guards? Oh, thank heaven you'vearrived! We are desperately in need of your help! First, I suppose Ishould tell you of the horrible event of three days ago.<br1>
Priestess Agneswas leading a group of the faithful of our congregation back home from apilgrimage to the Grand Temple in Giran when they were attacked by thedreaded Langk lizardmen.<br1>
They were all slaughtered mercilessly, in themost gruesome fashion! Now I can think of nothing but recovering theremains of our faithful and giving them a proper burial.<br1>
We must atleast recover the relics left by Agnes.<br1>
