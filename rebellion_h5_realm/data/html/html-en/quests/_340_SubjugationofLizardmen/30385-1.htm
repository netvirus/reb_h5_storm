Do you plan to follow the northern road on your voyage toOren? If so, you must beware of the lizardmen.<br1>
They are becoming morebrazen in their atrocities.<br1>
Those filthy reptiles! It wasn't enough toburn farms and slaughter livestock, now they are looting in broaddaylight! Something must be done about this outrage! Unfortunately, ourguards have their hands full with the Turek orcs and Ol Mahums.<br1>
Wehave come to the conclusion that we have no choice but to rely onmercenaries to save us from these lizardmen.<br1>
If you know any skilledones, send them to me.<br1>
