From all accounts it seems that the lizardmenworship Bifrons as a god.<br1>
I would not be surprised to discover that hewas being controlled by an even higher being.<br1>
I sense a great evil onthe *south shore of Gludio*.<br1>
You will not be able to deal with thismenace alone, you must bring your trusted comrades with you.<br1>
You mustkill the evil spirit and find a weird looking chest.<br1>
Inside this chestyou will find the *mark of darkness*.<br1>
Bring it to me.<br1>
Then, together,with the power of the goddess, we will destroy that blasphemous object.<br1>
