The followers of Einhasad will always be subjectto trials.<br1>
Now is no different, as the people of Gludio are beingconfronted by evil itself.<br1>
Lizardmen are reptiles.<br1>
They look somewhatlike dragons.<br1>
They are just the lackeys of Shilen.<br1>
The true evil we mustconfront is *evil spirit Bifrons*, who is secretly controlling theactions of the lizardmen.<br1>
Please help us deal with him.<br1>
