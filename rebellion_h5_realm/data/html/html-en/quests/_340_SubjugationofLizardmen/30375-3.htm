You have performed a noble deed for our temple.<br1>
NowAgnes can have a funeral befitting a person of her stature.<br1>
It is all sovery tragic! I know that all that happens is the will of Einhasad,still, when something so senseless happens it makes a person wonder.<br1>
Well, we must meditate upon the light and seek the truth of the Goddess.<br1>
Our struggle is bound to continue.<br1>
Our temple could definitely use theservices of a powerful defender such as yourself.<br1>
Please go and meetwith *High Priestess Levian*.<br1>
