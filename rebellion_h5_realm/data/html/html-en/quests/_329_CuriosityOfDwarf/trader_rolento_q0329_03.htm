Good! We understand each other well.<br1>
Actually, Irecently had a chance to see a destroyed granite golem, and within theremains I saw a piece of stone of a different hue.<br1>
I asked Sal, who hasprofound knowledge of magic, and he said the stone was a *heartstone*.<br1>
Ifound out that all the golems made by the magicians had a heartstone inthe center of their bodies.<br1>
What was it that he said? Something aboutputting a symbolic heart that resembles the living body into a stillstone figure, and then gathering the magic forces before beginning thespells .<br1>
.<br1>
Of course I didn't understand a word of what he was talkingabout, but anyway, it seems almost certain that the heartstone is thepower source of the golem.<br1>
So, I would like you to go into theWastelands and get me the *heartstone of a golem*.<br1>
There are many*granite golems* in the Wastelands.<br1>
There are also granite golems thatare nicknamed *punchers,* because they brandish their fists aboutfiercely.<br1>
Most heartstones shatter or crack when the golem is killed,but very rarely you can obtain whole, perfect heartstones.<br1>
I would likeyou to bring me all the heartstones you can find -- whether they bebroken or whole.<br1>
I will compensate you for as many as you bring back.<br1>
Ofcourse, I will be more generous for *perfect heartstones*.<br1>
