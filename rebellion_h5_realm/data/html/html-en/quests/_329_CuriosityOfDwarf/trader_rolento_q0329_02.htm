As Elves are infatuated with poetry and songs and Orcsrave over war, we Dwarves love to make things with our very own hands.<br1>
Ever since I was young, I immensely enjoyed fooling around with toyswith springs or pocket watches.<br1>
My dream is to make a *golem* with myown hands someday.<br1>
However, I am not talking about the animate, monstergolems that you can see frequently.<br1>
The golems made by the dwarves areautomatic dolls that move according to minute mechanical devices.<br1>
It istotally different from stone golems or granite golems, which weremagically blessed with life.<br1>
However, I always wondered what the energysource of a magically created golem would be.<br1>
No matter how carefully Ilooked at it, I could not find the part that generated power .<br1>
Thereare many golems in the Wastelands here.<br1>
They say it is because the devilBeleth and the magicians of the Ivory Tower used them as weapons of warin this land.<br1>
If that is true, then that means that more than a thousandyears have passed since the golems were abandoned in this land.<br1>
What doyou think? Aren't you getting curious, too? If you grant my request, itwill be a great help to my studies .<br1>
