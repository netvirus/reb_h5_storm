Oh, you have found some! I will reveal whether or notthe power to move rocks like living humans for hundreds of years lieswithin this small stone.<br1>
I must begin my research immediately --starting tonight.<br1>
Although it is difficult because I do not have anyproper tools or measuring devices, because this is not a workshop, I canmeasure the size with a ruler and the weight with a scale, and pound itwith my hammer to fathom its solidity and density.<br1>
Hmm .<br1>
so this goeslike this .<br1>
and .<br1>
Oh dear, I've been wrapped up too much in my ownthoughts, forgive me! As we promised, I will reward you by the number ofheartstones you have brought.<br1>
But I wish to have some more heartstonesto send to my guild brothers in Giran.<br1>
