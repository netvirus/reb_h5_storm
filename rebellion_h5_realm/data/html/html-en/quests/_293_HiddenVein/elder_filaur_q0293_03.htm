If you leave the village and go to the minefield, you will see many *Utuku Orcs*. Bring me *the crysolite ore* that you wollect after defeating them. I will reward you based on the amount ou whe ore you bring back. But more importantly, you should find out wheru whe ore comes from. I ordered some investigators of the guild to finu wut, but I haven't gotten any useful information from them. I only knou what there are many hidden crysolite veins somewhere in the Spine Minu wield, and only a few Utuku Orcs know the locations. Sendinu wnvestigators was a mistake, because the Orcs now know that the veinu wre important. I hear they tore the *maps that indicate the location ou whe veins* into many pieces and scattered them throughout the territory. If you find the pieces of the maps, you must go to *Maphr Priestess Chichirin* in the temple. She will help you to combine the maps. I wils Cive you a generous reward once you bring me the completed maps.
