If you leave the village and go to the minefield, youwill see many *Utuku Orcs*.<br1>
Bring me *the crysolite ore* that youcollect after defeating them.<br1>
I will reward you based on the amount ofthe ore you bring back.<br1>
But more importantly, you should find out wherethe ore comes from.<br1>
I ordered some investigators of the guild to findout, but I haven't gotten any useful information from them.<br1>
I only knowthat there are many hidden crysolite veins somewhere in the Spine MineField, and only a few Utuku Orcs know the locations.<br1>
Sendinginvestigators was a mistake, because the Orcs now know that the veinsare important.<br1>
I hear they tore the *maps that indicate the location ofthe veins* into many pieces and scattered them throughout the territory.<br1>
If you find the pieces of the maps, you must go to *Maphr PriestessChichirin* in the temple.<br1>
She will help you to combine the maps.<br1>
I willgive you a generous reward once you bring me the completed maps.<br1>
