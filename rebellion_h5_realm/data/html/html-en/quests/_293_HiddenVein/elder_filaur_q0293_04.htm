I am sorry, but if you come back with empty hands I can'treward you, no matter how hard you tried.<br1>
As I mentioned before, I willreward you based on the amount of *crysolite ore* that you collect afterdefeating *the Utuku Orcs*.<br1>
And don't forget .<br1>
*If you collect fourpieces of a torn map, you should visit Chichirin in the Maphr Temple*.<br1>
If you ask her for help, she will combine those torn pieces and make acomplete map.<br1>
I will give you a generous reward once you bring me thecompleted maps.<br1>
