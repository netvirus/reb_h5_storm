<font color="FF8000">Elder Filaur:</font><br>
While I was making an inspection of the Mithril Mine, Iwas attacked by *Utuku Orcs*.<br1>
Fortunately, my guards defeated the Orcs,but I found out something very interesting.<br1>
Rough ore was found in thepockets of the defeated Orcs, and I assume it is used as currencybetween Orcs.<br1>
The guards are all members of the Iron Gate and didn'trecognize the ore, but I noticed at once that the ore is *roughcrysolite*.<br1>
As you know, crysolite is used by the maestros to make highquality armor and weapons.<br1>
Until now, the entire supply has beenimported from Gracia, but this incident has provided a new method ofacquiring that rare metal.<br1>
But to take advantage of this opportunity, Ineed the help of young, energetic Dwarves like you.<br1>
