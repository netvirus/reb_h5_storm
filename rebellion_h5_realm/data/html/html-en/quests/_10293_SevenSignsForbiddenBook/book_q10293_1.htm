In the beginning of time, there was a sphere that heldthe contents of our great universe.<br1>
Within that sphere were two greatpowers, one light, and one dark.<br1>
These powers absorbed matter more basicand more complex than our minds can comprehend.<br1>
They aligned with matterand sounds and forms and ideas, and then formed shapes.<br1>
The white lightformed into shape of a woman called Einhasad, while the black lightgathered and formed into shape of a man.<br1>
He called himself Gran Cain.<br1>
The very first things that were formed were light(=Einhasad) anddarkness(=Gran Cain), and around these two entities formed the regionsof light and darkness.<br1>
