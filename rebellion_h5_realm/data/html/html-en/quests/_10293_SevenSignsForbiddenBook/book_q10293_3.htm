Pile of Books: After Solina's death, the surviving disciples and
followers went into the monastery and ceased communicating with the
outside, forming essentially a world of their own. Afterwards, the
Elmore-Aden kingdom was never short of rebellions and riots. Eventually,
an underground group called Embryo was formed, and made a huge impact in
many places all over the continent. In the end, the Elmore-Aden Kingdom
was destroyed after King Frintezza made a contract with the demon and
left for the tomb of empires. Thus the first great unification of the
human race was finished, and sank into the books of history. [Quest
