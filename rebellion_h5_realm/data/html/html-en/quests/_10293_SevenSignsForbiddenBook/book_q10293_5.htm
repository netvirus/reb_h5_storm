Stack of Books: There was a great master named Marf. She made the
ground, the sea, the sky, the mountains, and the forest using the energy
of light and darkness granted to her by Einhasad and Gran Kain. She then
created a race to help her work, the Dwarves. Marf taught them about
crafting skills, the art of sculpting and architecture, and mathematics
and measurements. The Dwarves then made more beautiful art than any
other race, and made beautiful and practical buildings, causing other
races to soon envy them. The Dwarves, not wanting to start a conflict,
shared their arts and craft with other races, and received gifts in
return for their generosity. [Quest _10293_SevenSignsForbiddenBook
