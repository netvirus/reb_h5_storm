There was a great master named Marf.<br1>
She made theground, the sea, the sky, the mountains, and the forest using the energyof light and darkness granted to her by Einhasad and Gran Kain.<br1>
She thencreated a race to help her work, the Dwarves.<br1>
Marf taught them aboutcrafting skills, the art of sculpting and architecture, and mathematicsand measurements.<br1>
The Dwarves then made more beautiful art than anyother race, and made beautiful and practical buildings, causing otherraces to soon envy them.<br1>
The Dwarves, not wanting to start a conflict,shared their arts and craft with other races, and received gifts inreturn for their generosity.<br1>
