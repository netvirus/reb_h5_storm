<font color="FF8000">Abyssal Saintess Elcadia:</font><br>
According to Solina's Biography that we readin the library, the Embryo group is deeply connected to Saintess Solina.<br1>
But there is almost nothing about Solina herself.<br1>
Of course, it would beher nature to let people know only what she wants them to know.<br1>
Anyway,in order for us to investigate the real identity of Embryo, we need tosearch the Monastery of Silence and track down her past.<br1>
