The *kaboo orcs* of the Fog Mountains are becomingbolder and bolder lately.<br1>
Before, they wouldn't dare set foot into theElven Forest, and now they dare to come into the village.<br1>
On top ofthat, more and more orc hordes are invading the forest.<br1>
I don't know howthe orcs can come near the village, with the guardians keeping watch atthe boundary of the woods.<br1>
They must be avoiding the eyes of theguardians using some clever method.<br1>
The elders have ordered us torecruit brothers who will help us to defeat the kaboo orcs.<br1>
