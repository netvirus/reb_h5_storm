Why have you come back so soon? Even as we speak, ourbeautiful woods are being invaded by the Orcs.<br1>
They are a race that doesnot know about beauty or purity.<br1>
We cannot let them violate our home,can we? But even if you say that your mind and body are tired, I willnot fault or scold you.<br1>
Sheath your blade at once and take shelter underthe shade of the Mother Tree.<br1>
