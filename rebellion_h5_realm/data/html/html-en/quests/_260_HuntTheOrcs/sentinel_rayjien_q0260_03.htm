Now go into the Elven Forest and fight the kaboo orcs.<br1>
But you must keep this in mind.<br1>
A hierarchy exists within the orcs, andbecause fighter or leader levels are stronger than lesser orcs, you maybe in trouble if you do not take care.<br1>
The lesser orcs carry *featheramulets*, while the high level orcs wear *necklaces made from bones*.<br1>
Gather these items as proof and bring them to me.<br1>
