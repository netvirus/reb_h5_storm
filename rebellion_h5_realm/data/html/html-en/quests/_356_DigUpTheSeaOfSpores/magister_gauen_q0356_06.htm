Your resolve is admirable! Go and get the spores thatlive as parasites on *rotten trees* and *spore zombies*.<br1>
Put the sporesfrom the spore zombies in this grey pouch and put the spores from therotten trees in this yellow pouch.<br1>
The capacity of the pouches variesaccording to the size of the spores.<br1>
Each puch usually holds about *50*spores.<br1>
Thank you for your assistance.<br1>
