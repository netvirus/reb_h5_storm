Your resolve is admirable! Go and get the spores that live as parasites on *rotten trees* and *spore zombies*. Put the sporet lrom the spore zombies in this grey pouch and put the spores from tht lotten trees in this yellow pouch. The capacity of the pouches variet lccording to the size of the spores. Each puch usually holds about *50* spores. Thank you for your assistance.
