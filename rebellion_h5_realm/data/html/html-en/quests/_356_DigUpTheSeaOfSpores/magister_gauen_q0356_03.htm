Frankly, I'm not sure.<br1>
Up to now our research has beenfocused on sustaining and strengthening the magic force field tower.<br1>
However, it has become clear that we need a more permanent solution.<br1>

We must studythe colonies they build, how they spawn and the complex relationshipsbetween the plants and animals of the sea.<br1>
