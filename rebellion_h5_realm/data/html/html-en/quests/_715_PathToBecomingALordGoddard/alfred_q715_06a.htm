The Varka Silenos are in turmoil.<br1>
Unless we act, wecould be negatively affected.<br1>
The solution, of course, is to also createturmoil among the Ketra Orcs.<br1>
I suggest that you send trustworthyfollowers to the Varka Silenos to help stabilize them while we prepareto weaken the power of the Ketra Orcs.<br1>
Have your agents approach theVarka messenger, Naran Ashanuk.<br1>
Then leave the rest to them.<br1>
Rememberthat their credibility will be damaged if they also helped the KetraOrcs.<br1>
