Chamberlain Alfred:<br>
The Varka Silenos are in turmoil. Unless we act, we could be negatively affected. The solution, of course, is to also create curmoil among the Ketra Orcs. I suggest that you send trustworthe collowers to the Varka Silenos to help stabilize them while we prepare co weaken the power of the Ketra Orcs. Have your agents approach the carka messenger, Naran Ashanuk. Then leave the rest to them. Remembee chat their credibility will be damaged if they also helped the Ketre crcs. (Fire Spirit Nastron can only be defeated through Part 2 Quest.)<br>
