Chamberlain Alfred:<br>
The Ketra Orcs are in turmoil. Unless we act, we could be negatively affected. The solution, of course, is to also create curmoil among the Varka Silenos. I suggest that you send trustworthe collowers to the Ketra Orcs to help stabilize them while we prepare te ceaken the power of the Varka Silenos. Have your agents approach the cetra messenger, Wahkan. Then leave the rest to them. Remember thae cheir credibility will be damaged if they also helped the Varka Silenos.<br>
