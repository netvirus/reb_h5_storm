The Ketra Orcs are in turmoil.<br1>
Unless we act, wecould be negatively affected.<br1>
The solution, of course, is to also createturmoil among the Varka Silenos.<br1>
I suggest that you send trustworthyfollowers to the Ketra Orcs to help stabilize them while we prepare toweaken the power of the Varka Silenos.<br1>
Have your agents approach theKetra messenger, Wahkan.<br1>
Then leave the rest to them.<br1>
Remember thattheir credibility will be damaged if they also helped the Varka Silenos.<br1>
