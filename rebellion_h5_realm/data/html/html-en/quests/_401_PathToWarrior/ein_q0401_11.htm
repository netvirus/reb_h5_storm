<font color="FFFF00">Master Auron:</font>Good!<br1> Once you've passed through the southern gate of the village, to the left you'll see the windmills of Windmill Hill.<br1> There you'll find giant poison spiders and arachnid trackers.<br1> You'll also find many spiders on the Fellmere Harvesting Grounds west of the Fellmere Lake over the northern mountains.<br1> Bring twenty of their legs to me.<br1> You must use only the sword of trial to kill them!<br1> Do you understand?<br1> Get going!<br>
