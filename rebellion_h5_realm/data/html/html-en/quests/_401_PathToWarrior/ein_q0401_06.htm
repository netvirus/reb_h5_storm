<font color="FFFF00">Master Auron:</font><br>
To take this test, you must first find the weapon that the *Warriors* call the *sword of trial*.<br1>
*Simplon* of the town of *Gludio* knows all about the sword.<br1>
These days, he works at a weapons and armor shop, but in the past he was a famous soldier, so treat him with respect.<br1>
If you show him this letter, he will receive you very cordially.<br>
