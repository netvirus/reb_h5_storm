<font color="FFFF00">Master Auron:</font>Good, so you have found the sword of trial.<br1> Here's what you must do now ...<br1> If you go out to the wilderness, you will find poison spiders -- their bodies are bigger than wagons, and they're violent and dangerous to deal with.<br1> Use only the rusty *bronze sword* to hunt the *poison spiders*.<br1> You may not use any other weapons. When you kill a poison spider, cut off its legs and keep them.<br1> Ah yes, and you may also bring the legs of the *trimden*, a spider which is a little more ferocious even than the poison spider.<br1> Collect *twenty spider legs* and bring them here.<br1> That is the test to become a *Warrior*. If you pass this test, I will give you the medallion of the *Warrior*. <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=290 align="center"><br>
