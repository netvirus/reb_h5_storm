Ho, you have brought back ten rusted swords used by the tracker skeletons of the ruins.<br1>
I can tell from the Gracian characters engraved on the blade -- the undead of the ruins are all spirits of the soldiers that died during war with *Gracia*.<br1>
Anyway, many thanks for your trouble. Here, take one of these *rusted swords*.<br1>
Why? Because that is none other than the sword of trial!<br1>
What is that dumbfounded look on your face?<br1>
Don't be unreasonable. Look here, young fellow, did you think we warriors had a magical sword with splendid ornaments?<br1>
If I say that is the *sword of trial*, then understand that it is so, and be off!<br1>
Here, I will write you a letter to take to *Master Auron*!<br>
