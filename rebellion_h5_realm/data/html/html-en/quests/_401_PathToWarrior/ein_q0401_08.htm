<font color="FFFF00">Master Auron:</font><br>
So you've met *Simplon*?<br1>
I see he has given you a difficult task.<br1>
The *sword of trial* is not given to just anyone, you know.<br1>
But don't think too harshly of *Simplon* -- he may seem stern on the outside, but really he's a fine friend once you get to know him.<br>
