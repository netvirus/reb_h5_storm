<font color="FFFF00">Trader Simplon:</font>Recently, the lord announced that he would restore all the villages that became ruins during the war and solicited to the warriors guild for soldiers to do away with the undead.<br1> If you want to prove that you have the qualities of a Warrior, go to the *Ruins of Agony* and fight with the *tracker skeletons*!<br1> The skeletons in the ruins are the spirits of poor soldiers that lost their lives cruelly during the war and become undead.<br1> Bring back *ten rusted swords* that they used. While you perform this task, take this mark with you, since you have become a member of our warriors guild for a short time. What?<br1> Difficult? What are you saying!<br1> Twenty years ago when I was about your age, the *witch Cleo* led undead troops into the *Castle of Gludio*.<br1> My comrades and I fought against hundreds of skeletons in just one night!<br1> And here you are whining about killing just ten tracker skeletons?!<br1> No more unnecessary words, now be off with you!<br>
