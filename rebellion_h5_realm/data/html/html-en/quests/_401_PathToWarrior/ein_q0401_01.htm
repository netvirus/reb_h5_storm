<font color="FFFF00">Master Auron:</font><br>
Now I'm a master who teaches young Fighters, but I was once a soldier for the *Warrior League*, walking the borderline between of life and death on the battlefield.<br1>
To be accepted into the *Warrior League*, there's no need for a noble birth or the lord's recommendation.<br1>
We accept any Fighter who has courage and spirit.<br>
