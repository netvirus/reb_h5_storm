What?<br1>
Are you trying to become a *Warrior*?<br1>
Ha ha! To me, you seem like a novice! Well, now that I think of it, when I was young the elder soldiers would often look down on me because I had a childlike face.<br1>
So I will give you an opportunity. Well, if you want to be a *Warrior*, you must first find the *sword of trial*.<br1>
I already know where it is, but first let me test your disposition.<br>
