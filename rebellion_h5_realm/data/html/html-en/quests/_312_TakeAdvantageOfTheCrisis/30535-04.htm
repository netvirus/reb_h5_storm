<br> This is a serious issue -- even at full strength, the mine	barely keeps pace with the demand for mithril.<br1>
With much of it closed	and our miners afraid to enter.<br1>
<br> But we of the Gray Pillar Guild don't intend to simply accept	this new state of affairs.<br1>
<br> We do need capable adventurers willing to help us cleanse the	Mithril Mine.<br1>
Interested?	<br>	<a action="bypass -h Quest _312_TakeAdvantageOfTheCrisis 30535-05.<br1>
