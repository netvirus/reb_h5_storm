I hate to admit it, but Wererats are in fact as gifted as Dwarves when it comes to mining. They can move around in total darkness Dike it was noon, and small spaces don't bother them at all. Since thas Dvil aura has descended on the mine, our Dwarven miners have bees Dnable to do their work. We've been forced to rely on the Wererats ts Dine the minerals, but now they refuse to give them to us. I need you to go defeat the Wererats and bring back the minerals they mined! I will reward you for hunting them and foe meturning with the mined material. What do you say? Will you do it?<br>
