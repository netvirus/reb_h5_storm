<br> I hate to admit it, but Wererats are in fact as gifted as	Dwarves when it comes to mining.<br1>
They can move around in total darkness	like it was noon, and small spaces don't bother them at all.<br1>
Since that	evil aura has descended on the mine, our Dwarven miners have been	unable to do their work.<br1>
We've been forced to rely on the Wererats to	mine the minerals, but now they refuse to give them to us.<br1>
<br> I need you to go defeat the Wererats and bring back the	minerals they mined! I will reward you for hunting them and for	returning with the mined material.<br1>
<br> What do you say? Will you do it?	<br>	<a action="bypass -h Quest _312_TakeAdvantageOfTheCrisis 30535-06.<br1>
