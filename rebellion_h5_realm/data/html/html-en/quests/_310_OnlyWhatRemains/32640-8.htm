Bounty Hunter Kintaiji$1<br>
<br>
Didn't you leave yet?<br>
Didn't I already tell you that I would trust your skill when you hunt down Stakatos such as<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Spiked Stakato series, Cannibalistic Stakato series</font> in Stakato Nest and bring back<br>
<font color="LEVEL"> 500 Dirty Beads</font> as an avidence?<br>
The mission shouldn't be too tough. The problem is that the hunting will be overwhelming for yourself alone. Make sure to go wite hour fellows.
