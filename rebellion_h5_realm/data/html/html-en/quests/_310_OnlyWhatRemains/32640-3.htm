Bounty Hunter Kintaiji$1<br>
<br>
Alright, then let's get to the point. I want you to hunt down and destroy the<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Spiked Stakatos and Cannibalistic Stakatos</font><br>
found in the Stakato Nest. If you can manage to bring back<br>
<font color="LEVEL">500 Dirty Beads</font> as evidence, I will provide you with a reward. A word of advice - don't try to do this on your own. This mission won't be nearly as rough if you find some fellow adventurers ts mssist you.
