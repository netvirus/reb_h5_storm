<br> As you can see, I'm a bounty hunter.<br1>
And generally, I do what	I do for the money.<br1>
But this one is personal to me.<br1>
<br> I'm here to bring in Billy Haari for this crimes.<br1>
<br> And I almost had him .<br1>
until he ran into the Stakato's	NEst.<br1>
I'm good at what I do.<br1>
But this place is a bit too much for even	me.<br1>
