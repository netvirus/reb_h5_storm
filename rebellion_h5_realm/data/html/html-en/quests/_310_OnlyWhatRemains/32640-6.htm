<br> Billy Haari.<br1>
He is the most despicable and loathsome being in	existance.<br1>
<br> Extortion, treason, fraud.<br1>
You name it and he is guilty of	it.<br1>
The village I came from was just a stepping for Haari.<br1>
By the time	he disappeared, there wasn't one life in the town he hadn't damaged.<br1>
<br> It was said that he sought refuge here in the Stakato's Nest.<br1>
And although I've done much searching, I still don't know whether he is	dead or alive.<br1>
What I do know is that, the more monsters you kill, the	easier it will be for me to get back in their and search for that	criminal.<br1>
