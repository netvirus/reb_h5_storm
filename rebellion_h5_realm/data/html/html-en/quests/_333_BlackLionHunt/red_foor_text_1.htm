Some time ago, I overheard some dwarves talkingamong themselves in a blacksmiths shop The head of the dwarves perhapshe is called the first elder? Anyway, he was desperately looking for ascroll that had hieroglyphic characters of giants on it.<br1>
Although Ididnt get to hear the details, it seemed like some very critical secretregarding the giants scientific technology was written on it.<br1>
I alwaysthought that dwarves were just busying themselves with their work inblacksmith shops and being warehouse keepers.<br1>
But what do you know Ithink they have been working on secret things while avoiding thescrutiny of humans.<br1>
