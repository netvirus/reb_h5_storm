I really thank you for recovering so many freightboxes like this for us.<br1>
If the financial situation of our commercialguild were a bit better, we would hire competent mercenaries such asyourself as bodyguards.<br1>
In that case, the evil creatures would neverbe able to loot our stuff, no? OK! Here, take the gift of gratitude!The amount of the gratitude money increased greatly after I spoke to mysuperiors about the hard work you have been doing for our guild.<br1>
As thisis appropriate acknowledgment for your hard work, please take it withoutrefusing.<br1>
And, as always, I present you with these *coins from ourguild.<br1>
