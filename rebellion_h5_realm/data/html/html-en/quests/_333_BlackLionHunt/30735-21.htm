Dear brother.<br1>
I appreciate your hard work in carryingout the mission.<br1>
Ill give you your reward according to the number ofproofs you have brought back.<br1>
What is that box? It seems like you havebrought back a cargo box that belongs to a traders union.<br1>
Since there isno clause regarding the returning of a cargo box written in ourcontract, I guess we dont have the duty to return the cargo to thetraders.<br1>
But, if we return it to the traders union, perhaps they willgive us some sort of reward? If you dont feel like helping traders, youcan go see Red Foot.<br1>
He is an expert in dealing with spoils that arehard to get rid of.<br1>
