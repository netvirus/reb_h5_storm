All right, lets go ahead and open this box Openinga padlock like this one is a piece of cake Here we go! There that wastoo easy.<br1>
Now, lets see whats in the box.<br1>
A broken tablet fragment?Hmm It has some incomprehensible symbols on it.<br1>
Is this a relic fromancient times? If it was not a fragment but a complete tablet, thismight have been a very valuable historical object.<br1>
If you can find allthe fragments of the tablet, you can get them to be restored to itscomplete form If you are interested, go see *Rupio* the blacksmith.<br1>
