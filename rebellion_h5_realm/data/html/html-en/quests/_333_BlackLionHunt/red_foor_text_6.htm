I heard that if you go near the Ivory Tower inOren, you will find a fake alchemist.<br1>
It is said that he goes aroundtelling people that he can make some magic potion that will make peopleswishes come true Many people have fallen victim to his fake potion.<br1>
Butwhat is surprising is that once in a blue moon, after using the potionpeoples wishes actually did come true.<br1>
