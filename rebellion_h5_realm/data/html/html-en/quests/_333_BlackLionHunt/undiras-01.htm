Due to the humans distorted religiousreformation, our goddess that we worship has been misunderstood to be asinister being that brings death and destruction.<br1>
But we dark elvesstill worship Shilen as our creator and as a goddess who is in charge oflife and death.<br1>
Unfortunately, when this place was invaded by the alliedforces of humans and elves, many sacred objects which were decoratingthe temple were lost.<br1>
Especially, many statues of the goddess Shilenwhich were exquisitely crafted were stolen.<br1>
The statue you brought hereis one of the statues that were lost at that time.<br1>
Thank you so much.<br1>
Here is the reward money I promised you.<br1>
If you find any more statueslike this, please bring them to me.<br1>
