Some time ago, I heard a rumor that there is asociety of ancient coin collectors.<br1>
At first, I thought that they mustbe collectors of some anniversary coins that are not very valuable.<br1>
Butlater, I found out that the value of the coins they collect is extremelyhigh.<br1>
And members of this society are very enthusiastic about theircollection activities that whoever brings some rare coins to them, theywill trade them for some high priced items! I heard that in order tojoin the coin collection society, you have to go see a dwarf calledSorint at the Hunters Village.<br1>
