The headquarters of delu lizardmen was originallylocated at the shore area in the southern part of Giran.<br1>
However,lately, many of them are infiltrating into Dion territory.<br1>
We dont knowyet whether they are entering Dion just to find food or to prepare somelarge scale invasion.<br1>
But what is clear is that they are making theirmovements with some clear goal.<br1>
Our mission is to smash their units oneby one and instill fear in them thereby discouraging them from settlingdown in this area.<br1>
