I'm extremely interested in the civilization ofthe titans.<br1>
In particular, I'd pay any amount to hold in my hands a claytablet on which the titan writing is written.<br1>
If I was some high-classperson such as yourself, I might have seen such a thing as that.<br1>
Theysay that ancient clay tablets are often found in the Dion region.<br1>
