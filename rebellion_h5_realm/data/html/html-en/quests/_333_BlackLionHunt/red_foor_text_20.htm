Hey brother! Did you tell me that youre currentlyon active duty? I know that must be hard work! Is there anything I canhelp you with? What kind of box is that? Oh, I know.<br1>
Thats a cargo boxused by traders.<br1>
Since you brought it to me I can assume that you donthave any intention of returning it to the merchant, am I right? Allright.<br1>
Ill open the box for you.<br1>
Of course, you can have the contentsof the box.<br1>
Instead, Ill charge you a small fee.<br1>
I think *650 adena*will be appropriate.<br1>
Think of it as the price for opening the box andfor keeping my mouth shut.<br1>
