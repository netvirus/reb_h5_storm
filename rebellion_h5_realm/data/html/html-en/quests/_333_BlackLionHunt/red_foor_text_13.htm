Have you heard of the Aden Business Guild? It is anassociation of human traders.<br1>
Since they saw that dwarven traders andwarehouse keepers were generating a lot of profit while engaging intheir organizational activities, humans decided to imitate them byforming a guild of their own.<br1>
However, it seems to me that the businesssavvy of a dwarf is inborn No matter how hard humans try, I dont thinkthey can keep up with dwarves.<br1>
On top of that, adding insult to injury,evil spirits frequently attack the guilds cargo wagons and steal theirvaluable goods making the humans suffer great losses.<br1>
