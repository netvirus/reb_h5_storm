The undead that we need to drive out are *specters,sorrow maiden, neer crawlers, neer ghoul berserker, strains andghouls*.<br1>
I dont know whether you know about this or not.<br1>
But wheanundead is destroyed, it leaves behind a handful of ashes.<br1>
Bring me backthat as proof of victory.<br1>
The more *ashes of undead * you bring, themore rewards you will receive.<br1>
Since you once worked under CaptainLeopold, you already know the rule about proofs and rewards, dont you? Now then, hurry up.<br1>
Prepare yourself for combat and leave for theExecution Ground immediately.<br1>
