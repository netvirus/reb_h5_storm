Dear brother of the Black Lion.<br1>
Our current situationis as follows.<br1>
As I said before, our current mission is to drive out theevil spirits in this area.<br1>
However, since the main force of themercenary troop has been dispatched to Gludio, our military force issuffering a shortage.<br1>
The only thing we are managing to do right now isto contain the evil spirits from attacking the village.<br1>
Fortunately,Captain Leopold of Gludin has sent many newly selected mercenarybrothers.<br1>
So we can launch our attack on the stronghold of the evilspirits in earnest.<br1>
Brother, I would like you to join us in this fight.<br1>
