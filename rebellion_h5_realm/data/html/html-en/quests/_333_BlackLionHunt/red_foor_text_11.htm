I will give you some information that will beuseful to someone who travels a lot like yourself.<br1>
According to the lawof the land, the traders of this kingdom are not allowed to deal withcriminals.<br1>
But there are some traders who ignore this rule and selltheir items to outlaws.<br1>
These people include, Grocer Pano of FloranVillage and Twyla who has set up her trade in the western section of theDark Forest.<br1>
Although they are business people, I think its shameless ofthem to deal with criminals just to make money.<br1>
