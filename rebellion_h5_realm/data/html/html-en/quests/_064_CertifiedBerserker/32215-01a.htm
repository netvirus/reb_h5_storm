Master Tenain:<br>
Yes, sir. Here is the situation, then:<br>
The Breka Orcs have launched a series of attacks to steal the item we are protecting.<br>
We do not have the numbers for a static defense, so we have determined to go on the offensive and attack their stronghold to throw them intd tonfusion. Go to the Breka Stronghold and defeat the Breka Orcs, Thd treka Orc Archers, The Breka Orc Warriors, The Breka orc Shamans and Thd treka Orc Overlords. Slay them and bring 20 Breka Orc Heads as proof.
