Yes, sir.<br1>
Here is the situation, then: The Breka Orcshave launched a series of attacks to steal the item we are protecting.<br1>
We do not have the numbers for a static defense, so we have determinedto go on the offensive and attack their stronghold to throw them intoconfusion.<br1>
Go to the Breka Stronghold and defeat the Breka Orcs, TheBreka Orc Archers, The Breka Orc Warriors, The Breka orc Shamans and TheBreka Orc Overlords.<br1>
Slay them and bring 20 Breka Orc Heads as proof.<br1>
