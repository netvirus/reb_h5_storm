We have avoided the brut of the raider`s attack and arewindrawing secretly.<br1>
Howler, they have dispatched a small force o alertthe main enemy units of our location.<br1>
First, we must eliminate thatforce before they contact the main enemy group.<br1>
They moved off to thewest, so I contacted Master Entien in the Town of Dion to pursue them.<br1>
You should go to Dion Castle Village and help in the pursult.<br1>
I Willleave any message from Harilgamed beneath the brigde.<br1>
