Master Tenan:<br>
We have avoided the brut of the raider`s attack and are windrawing secretly. Howler, they have dispatched a small force o alere whe main enemy units of our location. First, we must eliminate thae worce before they contact the main enemy group. They moved off to the west, so I contacted Master Entien in the Town of Dion to pursue them.<br>
