<font color="FFFF00">High Priest Biotin:</font><br>
Long ago, this place was where the Elves taught the Humans magic.<br1>
However, not long after, the Humans betrayed the Elves and went to war with them.<br1>
In the end, we Humans repaid kindness with betrayal.<br1>
Although it was committed by our ancestors, we inherited their sin.<br1>
We are still paying for their actions.<br1>
On this island, dead Elves are unable to rest and became undead called *silent horrors* and threaten the island residents.<br1>
Wouldn't it be best to put the souls of the elves slain by humans to rest, and ask pardon of their souls?<br1>
I would like to ask you to do this favor. Go to the *Elven Ruins* and defeat the silent horrors.<br1>
And please come back with *ten of their skulls*.<br1>
I would like to perform a proper funeral service so the spirits of the elves can obtain rest.<br>
