<font color="FFFF00">Captain Bezique:</font><br>
I have seen many young people like you who seek to become Human Knights.<br1>
They foolishly try to act the part of the hero, and put not only themselves, but others in danger with their foolishness.<br1>
This age no longer needs noble heroes. No one expects a courageous knight to appear and save them.<br1>
Do you know what the people want?<br1>
They want well-organized guards, carrying good weapons that will protect them, and a strong castle wall outside the village.<br>
