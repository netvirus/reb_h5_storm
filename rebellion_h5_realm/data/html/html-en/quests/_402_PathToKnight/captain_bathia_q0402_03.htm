<font color="FFFF00">Captain Bathis:</font><br>
Have you defeated the bugbear raiders? What do you mean, not yet?<br1>
What have you done all this time?!<br1>
I have already reported to my superiors that I have sent out soldiers to destroy the bugbears ...<br1>
What will they take me for?! At this very moment, the Traders that do business with Dion are losing quite a bit of profit by having to take the long way around on the southern coastal road!<br1>
This is not the time for you to be fooling around in the village!<br1>
Go defeat the bugbears and bring back *ten necklaces*.<br1>
Then I will give you the coin of the lords!
