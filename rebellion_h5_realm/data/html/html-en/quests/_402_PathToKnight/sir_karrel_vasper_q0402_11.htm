<font color="FFFF00">Sir Klaus Vasper:</font><br>
Welcome, comrade of the sword.<br1>
I see you have had great success on your pilgrimage.<br1>
You have brought many coins of lords when you only had to bring three ...<br1>
This proves that you have sufficient ability and disposition to become a Human Knight.<br1>
Now, do you want to complete the trial of the esquire?<br1>
If so, I will give you the sword of ritual, with which you may change your profession to a Human Knight.<br1>
Of course, if you want, you need not finish the trial of the esquire, but may instead continue with your journey.<br>
