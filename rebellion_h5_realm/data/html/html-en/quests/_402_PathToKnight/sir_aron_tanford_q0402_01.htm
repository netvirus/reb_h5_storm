From that mark, I see you are undergoing the Trial of the Esquire.<br1>
I guess they are giving opportunities to amateurs like you these days?<br1>
Your courage is admirable but I want to advise you to give up.<br1>
Do you think just anyone becomes a Knight?<br1>
Even more, you are not even of noble background, are you?<br1>
One cannot become a true Knight without born disposition and talent.<br1>
It is truly pathetic to see lowly ones struggle to become a Knight.
