If you follow the road southeast of the village, you will come to a river that marks the border between Gludio and Dion.<br1>
There is *a bridge* that crosses the river. Recently, *bugbears raiders* have appeared near the bridge and attacked trader coaches.<br1>
Already twenty traders have lost their lives, and the goods that were stolen are too numerous to list.<br1>
The traders have requested funds from the trader's guild headquarters in order to hire mercenaries, but the guild has yet to answer their request.<br1>
I would be much obliged if you would get rid of the bugbears.<br1>
According to the reports, there are about ten bugbears that attacked the trader coaches.<br1>
Kill them and bring back *ten necklaces*.<br1>
While on this task, you will be performing an official task of the Gludio guards, so take this with you.
