<font color="FFFF00">Sir Klaus Vasper:</font><br>
My comrade of the sword, you are still not experienced enough to become a Knight.<br1>
I can see the true passion and  belief you hold in your heart, but those are not enough -- only through  the forge of battle will you also gain the power to hold fast to those  beliefs in the midst of unrighteousness.<br1>
Come back when you are a little older and wiser.<br1>
When you are ready, I will test your worthiness to be a true Knight.<br>
