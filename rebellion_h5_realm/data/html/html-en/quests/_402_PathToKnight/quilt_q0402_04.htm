You have brought back ten skulls from the ruins.<br1>
With these, I can perform a proper funeral service for the elves that were slain a long time ago.<br1>
May the departed spirits of the ruins forget their resentment of a thousand years, and gain peace within the arms of Einhasad.<br1>
Please take this coin ... This is proof that you have given a great contribution to the people of Gludio.<br1>
May your sword continue to be used to punish evil, and your shield be used to protect the righteous. May the protection of light be with you!
