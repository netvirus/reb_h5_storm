You want to become a Human Knight?<br1>
Then you must go through the* trial of the esquire* to prove that you are not merely a rash, hot-blooded fighter, but one with true knightly spirit.<br1>
This is a form of ritual and a process of training that all who desire to become a Human Knight must perform.<br>
