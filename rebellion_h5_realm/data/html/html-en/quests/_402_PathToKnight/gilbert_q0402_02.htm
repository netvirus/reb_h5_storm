Giant spiders have always existed on Talking Island.<br1>
They used to only live on the northern part of the island, but lately incidents of their attacking homes and carrying off livestock have increased.<br1>
They are so huge and ferocious that it is sometimes too difficult for the guard troop to deal with them. Please.<br1>
Destroy the giant spiders. *Hunt the spiders and peel off their husks.<br1>
Return with twenty husks and I will give you the coin of the lords.<br1>
* I am sorry to ask you to do such a dangerous task, but I cannot think of anyone but you who could possibly manage this.
