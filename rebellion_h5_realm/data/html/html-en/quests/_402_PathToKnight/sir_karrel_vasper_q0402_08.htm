<font color="FFFF00">Sir Klaus Vasper:</font><br>
Very well.<br1>
I, Sir Klaus Vasper, the guardian knight of the west, bestow this *Trial of the Apprentice Knight* upon you.<br1>
Always carry this mark with you while embarking on the trial. This is how people along your pilgrimage will recognize you as an apprentice knight.<br1>
As you go around to the villages in the Gludio region, try to meet with the local *guard captain* or the *high priest.*<br1>
They will suggest many difficult tasks that you may perform for the people.<br1>
When you complete these tasks, you can obtain a Coin of Lords.<br1>
If you return with *three or more Coins*, you will have completed your trial. Then, embark on your journey. May Einhasad's protection be with you.<br>
