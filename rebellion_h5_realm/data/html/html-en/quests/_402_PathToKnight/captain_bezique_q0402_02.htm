My my ... you are quite stubborn. Fine.<br1>
If you must play the part of the hero ... why don't you go and hunt the spiders that have been wrecking havoc lately?<br1>
Giant spiders have recently been reported upturning farmers' carts, raiding sheep and cattle, and even attacking Humans.<br1>
The monsters you need to hunt are called *poison spiders, or trimden*.<br1>
Cut off their legs, then bring back twenty of them and I will give you the coin of the lords.<br1>
Follow the southern coastal road and you will reach the area where they usually appear.<br1>
I must follow procedure, so as a captain of the guard, I give you this mark to take with you.<br1>
Well then, I hope you return with your life!<br>
