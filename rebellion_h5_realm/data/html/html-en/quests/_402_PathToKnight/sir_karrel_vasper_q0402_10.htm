<font color="FFFF00">Sir Klaus Vasper:</font><br>
Come, comrade of the sword. You have done well.<br1>
By bringing these three coins of lords, you have proven you have the abilities and qualities to become a Knight.<br1>
Now, do you want to complete the trial of the esquire?<br1>
If so, I will give you the sword of ritual, with which you may change your profession to a Human Knight. Of course, if you want, you need not finish the trial of the esquire, but may instead continue with your journey.<br>
