<font color="FFFF00">Sir Klaus Vasper:</font><br>
You have successfully endured a most demanding trial. Congratulations!<br1>
Now you are qualified to become a Human Knight. I will give you the sword of ritual.<br1>
This sword was used in the knighting ceremony of the legendary Sir Cedric -- bear it with care.<br1>
If you take this to the Grand Master of the fighters guild, he will change your profession to a Human Knight.<br1>
Now, it is time for you to leave. Keep the faith and the romance of chivalry in your heart, and make your own destiny.<br1>
May the good will of Einhasad always remain with you through every challenge.
