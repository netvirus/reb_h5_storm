<font color="FFFF00">Sir Klaus Vasper:</font><br>
Knights were initially chosen to fight injustice and to protect the weak. The right to wear a sword and shield goes along with the responsibility to protect citizens from danger. The attire of knights has changed many times along with the changes of eras, but the fact that we are guardians of ordinary folk has not changed.<br1>
That is because of the divine calling that we received from Einhasad, mother of creation. The moment that a young warrior begins the life of a guardian knight and embarks on a training mission is called the *Trial of an Apprentice Human Knight.* An apprentice knight travels all over the kingdom, usually to the areas that don't receive the protection of the army, and aids those who ask for help. Those we receive help gives a *Coin of Lords* as a token of the thanks to the apprentice knight.<br>
