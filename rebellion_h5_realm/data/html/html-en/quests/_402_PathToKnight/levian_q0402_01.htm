This is the holy hall of Einhasad.<br1>
How could you clad yourself with the tools of war and enter the most holy place?<br1>
From your mark, I see you are a Knight in training.<br1>
If that is the case, shouldn't you show all the more respect in the Temple of Einhasad?<br1>
Next time, enter the temple in a more reverent costume.<br>
