May the blessings of Einhasad be with you in your pilgrimage.<br1>
Long ago the knights of the alliance were the protectors of the church of Einhasad -- in the chaos that followed the fall of the empire, it was the Knights of the alliance that protected the church from raiders and pagans, and protected the Priests from the evil army of Beleth that threatened the entire kingdom.<br1>
We have not forgotten the assistance we received from them.<br>
