<font color="FFFF00">Sir Klaus Vasper:</font><br>
Welcome, comrade of the sword.<br1>
I cannot be anything but surprised - it has been long indeed since any esquires that have brought back six coins of lords.<br1>
This is more than enough to prove that you have the abilities and qualities to become a Human Knight.<br1>
Now it is time to complete your trial as esquire.<br1>
You have successfully endured this most demanding trial.<br1>
Congratulations! Now you have earned the qualifications to become a Knight.<br1>
I will give you the sword of ritual.<br1>
This sword was used in the knighting ceremony of the legendary Sir Cedric -- bear it with care.<br1>
If you take this to the Grand Master of the fighters guild, he will change your profession to a Human Knight.
