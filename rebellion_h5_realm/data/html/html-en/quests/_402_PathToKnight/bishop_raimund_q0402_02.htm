<font color="FFFF00">High Priest Raymond:</font><br>
There is no doubt that Einhasad has guided your footsteps here.<br1>
You see, something is troubling me, and I was thinking of asking for the help of the knights.<br1>
A few years ago, during the war with Gracia, we sent several priests to a small village in the south, now called the Ruins of Despair. There, the priests treated the wounded and performed funerals for the dead.<br1>
But the village was suddenly attacked by mercenaries and the wounded soldiers, village people, and the priests of Einhasad were all brutally murdered.<br1>
The spirits of the dead have no peace and still haunt the ruins in the form of undead.<br1>
It is the duty of a priest to console their spirits and put them to rest through prayer, but it is too dangerous of a task for someone not trained as a Cleric, like myself, to face the vicious monsters of black magic. That is why I am asking you a favor.<br>
