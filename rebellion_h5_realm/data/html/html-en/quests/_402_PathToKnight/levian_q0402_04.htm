Thank you.<br1>
Now the lizardmen will not dare covet the land of Gludio.<br1>
When I look at the strange idols of the lizardmen, I get shivers.<br1>
I am thinking of burning these unholy things. As we agreed, I will give you the coin of lords.<br1>
May you always live by the will of Einhasad.<br1>
Only the spiritual teachings of light will protect you from corruption.<br1>
Pray, do not take my advice lightly. I have seen many Knights fall to the apostles of darkness because of arrogance.<br1>
In the end, theyreturn to the arms of Einhasad as they are cleansed in the flames of the stake, but it is not a desirable fate.
