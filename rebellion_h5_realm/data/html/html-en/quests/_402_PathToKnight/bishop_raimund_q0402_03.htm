Esquire, I beg you! Please go to the *Ruins of Despair* to the south of the village and find the *departed spirits of the priests* that have turned into the undead.<br1>
Destroy them with your sword and recover the Einhasad crosses that are somewhere on their bodies.<br1>
*If you bring back twelve Einhasad crosses, I can perform a mass that soothes the spirits of the dead priests.* Before you go, take this.<br1>
It is a mark that shows you are performing a holy task for the church of Einhasad. Well than, I shall pray for your safe return.<br1>
May the light of Einhasad guide you.
