Ho ho, so you've really killed twenty poison spiders!<br1>
Perhaps I've been too harsh on you.<br1>
I was just about to organize a team of soldiers to battle the poison spiders, because I thought you weren't coming back.<br1>
I apologize for being rude. Here, I give you one of the few coins of the lords I have in my possession.<br1>
I hope you have a successful quest.
