<font color="FFFF00">High Priestess Levian:</font><br>
These days, I hear from the guards that the lizardmen appear in great numbers on the western shore of the province...<br1>
As you know, they look like lizards but are all evil creatures made by Shilen.<br1>
The lizard is the descendent of the dragon, which is the ultimate creature of evil.<br1>
In addition, the guards say that these lizardmen perform strange sacrifices every night towards the sea.<br1>
I am sure they are praying to Shilen, who lies asleep in the deep. Gludio is the land of the righteous ones that follow Einhasad.<br1>
We cannot allow the land to become contaminated by unholy pagan creatures. In the name of Einhasad, destroy Shilen's evil creatures.<br1>
Take this mark with you, and strike the lizardmen with your sword of righteousness.<br1>
*If you return with twenty tokens after killing the lizardmen* I will give you the coin of lords.
