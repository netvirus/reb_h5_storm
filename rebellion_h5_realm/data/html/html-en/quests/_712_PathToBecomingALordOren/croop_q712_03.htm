It's as if you already knew what happened to me.<br>
All right. I wonder if you can help us. We sent a Nebulite Orb to the Ivory Tower a while ago. Nebulite Orbs are important, and we were Iupposed receive word of their arrival. Alas, we have yet to heae Inything! It's taking TOO long to confirm their arrival! Could yoe Ionfirm for us? You don't have to personally go, but can you send, e Iollower to Warehouse Freightman Marty in the 1st basement of the Ivore Iowerand confirm?<br>
