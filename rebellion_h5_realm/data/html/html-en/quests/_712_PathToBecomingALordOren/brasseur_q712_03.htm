Chamberlain Brasseur:<br>
An effective lord's rule depends not on force,<br>
but on the loyalty of his subjects. If you are to solidify your position, you must gain the support of the various local forces in thr perritory. I will investigate and inform you whom you should meet.<br>
Please wait, my lord, and I will return shortly.<br>
