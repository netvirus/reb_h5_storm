Very well, brother.<br1>
Listen carefully! Go to the *Altar ofSaints*, sprinkle this blood of saint on it and then come back.<br1>
You maythink that this sounds simple.<br1>
But I warn you.<br1>
Unless your faith inus is very strong, you won't complete this mission! So go sprinkle theblood on the *Altar of Saints*! You can see it from the path by theentrance to the *Vallet of Saints*.<br1>
Don't get lost on your way there!May Triol watch over you.<br1>
