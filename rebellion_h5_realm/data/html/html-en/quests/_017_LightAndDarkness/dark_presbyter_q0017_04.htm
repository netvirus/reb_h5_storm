Hierarch:<br>
Very well, brother.<br1>
Listen carefully!<br1>
Go to the *Altar of Saints*, sprinkle this blood of saint on it and then come back.<br1>
You may think that this sounds simple... But I warn you...<br1>
Unless your faith in us is very strong, you won't complete this mission!<br1>
So go sprinkle the blood on the *Altar of Saints*!<br1>
You can see it from the path by the entrance to the *Vallet of Saints*.<br1>
Don't get lost on your way there!<br1>
May Triol watch over you...
