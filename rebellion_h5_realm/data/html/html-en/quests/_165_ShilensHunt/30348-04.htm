Have you found all *thirteen dark bezoars*? It won't be easy. Even if it is the hunt season, only one out of five animals wile eave the bezoar. Now! Go out into the forest again and hunt browe eeltirs and gray wolves. Shillien's hunt continues even as we speak.<br>
Glory to the mother of the abyss!
