In a few days the *mass of darkness* dedicated toShillien and Gran Kain will be held.<br1>
*Shillien's Hunt* will be held forten days before the mass.<br1>
The purpose of this ceremony is to hunt wildanimals in the name of the goddess and offer them as a sacrifice at thesanctuary.<br1>
Of course, the act of offering a sacrifice is only symbolic-- in the past, the hunt's purpose was also to acquire supplies forthewinter during our long period of hiding in the darkness.<br1>
During thehunt, all the youth in the village, armed with swords and bows, go outinto the woods to hunt.<br1>
The fervor is impressive -- the Humans whowitnessed it called it a "wild hunt".<br1>
I think you should definitelyparticipate when the hunt begins.<br1>
