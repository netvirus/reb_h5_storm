I'm Pierce, captain of the Golden RamMercenary Force.<br1>
Kahman has told me quite a bit about you.<br1>
Your servicein these hard times has been invaluable! The Swamp of Screams pales incomparison to the hellish battlefields that we've seen.<br1>
But, in the nameof Seighardt, and for the honor of our force, we cannot fail thismission! Don't forget to pack all the supplies you'll need before you goto the battlefield.<br1>
An army travels on its stomach, I've always said.<br1>
