<font color="FF8000">Mercenary Supplier Abercrombie:</font><br>
As usual, the delivery of supplies arevery unreliable in this godforsaken swampland! My life is totallymiserable! The monsters around here are a real pain! I should've knownwhen they sent me out here to the northernmost corner of nowhere.<br1>
Dammit! What am I doing here!? They don't pay me enough! I don't knowwhat my bosses are thinking! When Sighardt led the mercenary army,things like this never happened! Challenges always existed, but at leastlife was liveable! Did you want an item? Hold on, give me a moment.<br1>
