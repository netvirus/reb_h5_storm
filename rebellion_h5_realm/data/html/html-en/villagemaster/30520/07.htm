I am a respected Dwarf who teaches DwarvenFighters and Scavengers.<br1>
What has brought you to me? Surely you didn'tcome because you thought you could learn something from me, did you?With the slow minds of your race, you cannot catch up with the Dwarves'economic abilities, commercial sense, or keen understanding of money.<br1>
Now that you know, go back to your sword fighting.<br1>
