To qualify to become an Scavenger, your levelmust be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Scavenger.<br1>
However, even if you have earned the qualifications, I cannot changeyour profession.<br1>
This is because only those who have experienced Humansociety and understand the great world beyond the Spine Mountains arequalified to change profession.<br1>
Only then can you become a Dwarfempowered to control the world's economy.<br1>
To take the Test of theScavenger, go to *Collector Pippi* in the Bronze Key Guild over there.<br1>
She will tell you everything you need to know.<br1>
If you earn thequalifications, go to *the village of Gludin* and meet *Warehouse ChiefMoke*.<br1>
He will change your profession to Scavenger if you have preparedyourself properly.<br1>
