The *Black Anvil Guild* is truly the drivingforce of the Dwarves' prosperity.<br1>
While other races were Brandishingtheir bamboo spears and stone axes, our ancestors had already masteredbronze tools and were studying the secrets of Steel.<br1>
The Black AnvilGuild continues the traditions of our ancestors through preciseworkmanship and a noble spirit of craftsmanship.<br1>
Our guild has producedall the great craftsmen of the Dwarven society.<br1>
Our Mithril weapons andadamantite armor are traded at the highest prices in any market.<br1>
Also,our guild members study the lost science and technology of the giantsmore deeply than anyone else.<br1>
The siege golems and airships that wealone create are the results of such studies.<br1>
