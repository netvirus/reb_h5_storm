To be a Treasure Hunter, your level must be over 40 and you need tocollect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of theSearcher.<br1>
Your level is still insufficient and you don't have the 3marks.<br1>
Come back to me after more training.<br1>
Come back after you havecollected all 3 marks and increased your level to 40.<br1>
Then I shallchange your occupation to a Treasure Hunter.<br1>
