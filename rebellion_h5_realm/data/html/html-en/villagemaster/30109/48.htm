To be a Dark Avenger, your level must be over 40 and you need tocollect the Mark of Duty, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of Witchcraft.<br1>
Your level is still insufficient and you don't have the 3 marks.<br1>
Comeback to me after more training.<br1>
Come back after you have collected all 3marks and increased your level to 40.<br1>
Then I shall change youroccupation to a Dark Avenger.<br1>
