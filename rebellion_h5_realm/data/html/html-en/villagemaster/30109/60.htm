But what is this, you level is not high enough and you haven'teven collected all of the marks.<br1>
I told you when I was explaining aboutoccupations didn't I? Come back after collecting the marks and afterincreasing your level to 40.<br1>
Then I shall change your occupation in to aPlainswalker.<br1>
