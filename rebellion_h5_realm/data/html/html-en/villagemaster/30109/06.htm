If Temple Knights are just like Elven Knights but more advanced,focusing on defense the Swordsinger is a little bit different.<br1>
First ofall their defense ability lacks the most among Knights.<br1>
They use a skillcalled Sword Singing during party play or Siege Battle using skills ofdance and other Supplementary Magic together to increase their party'sexperience.<br1>
During party play or blood pledge war, Swordsingers are veryuseful but individual skills are behind Temple Knights.<br1>
Sword Singing iswhat you will mainly use, it restores your party members or blood pledgemembers HP, increases the evasion and the speed of movement.<br1>
It iscomparable to the Dark Elves' Bladedancer's dancing which is anoffensive skill.<br1>
To be a Swordsinger, your level must be over 40 and youneed to collect the Mark of the Challenger, the Mark of Life, and theMark of the Duelist.<br1>
