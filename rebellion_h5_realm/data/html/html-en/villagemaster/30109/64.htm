To be a Silver Ranger, your level must be over 40 and you need tocollect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Life, and the Mark of theSagittarius.<br1>
But what is this, you level is not high enough and youhaven't even collected all of the marks.<br1>
I told you when I wasexplaining about occupations didn't I? Come back after collecting themarks and after increasing your level to 40.<br1>
Then I shall change youroccupation in to a Silver Ranger.<br1>
