Gladiators are excellent Fighters during 1 on 1 situations, unlikeWarlords.<br1>
Specifically, he carries two weapons on both hand and becausehe thinks offense is the best form of defense he does not wear heavyarmor.<br1>
During party play the Gladiator is one of the strongest non-magiccharacter.<br1>
Also if a melee occurs or pin-point attack situation occurshe still can overcome it.<br1>
This is why he uses a skill which uses histwin blades' strong slashes repeatedly.<br1>
And he can fire sword beams tooppress his opponent.<br1>
To be a Gladiator, your level must be over 40 andyou need to collect the Mark of the Challenger, the Mark of Trust, andthe Mark of the Duelist.<br1>
