To be a Warlord, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect theMark of the Challenger, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Champion.<br1>
Your level is still insufficient and you don't have the 3 marks.<br1>
Comeback to me after more training.<br1>
Come back after you have collected all 3marks and increased your level to 40.<br1>
Then I shall change youroccupation to a Warlord.<br1>
