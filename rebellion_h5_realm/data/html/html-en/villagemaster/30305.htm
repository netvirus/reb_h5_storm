May the mercy of Shilen shade you from the light.<br1>
Iam Tetrarch Vellior of the Dark Elves, heir of the dark truth of thesacred book Icarus, envoy to the other world, and highest Mystic towield black magic in the place of Patriarch Mitraell, who is now sealedaway.<br1>
*Black magic* is the source of our power and the revelation ofdark truth.<br1>
It is forbidden among other races.<br1>
They do not understanddarkness and fear it, so therefore they exclude it.<br1>
However, if there islight, there is shadow, and we can control the true power of black magicbecause we confront darkness with no fear.<br1>
