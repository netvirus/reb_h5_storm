To qualify to become an Artisan, your level mustbe at least be 20 and you must pass the Test of the Artisan.<br1>
However,even if you earn these qualifications, I cannot change your profession.<br1>

A Dwarf must have a full understanding of the outsideworld's economy.<br1>
To take the Test of the Artisan, go to *BlacksmithSilvery*.<br1>
