To be qualified to become a Dark Wizard, your levelmust be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Dark Wizard.<br1>
Youmust meet *Shamaness Varika* to take the Test of the Dark Wizard.<br1>
She isstaying at the altar, southwest of the village.<br1>
You must pass the testshe gives you and bring back the *jewel of darkness* as proof.<br1>
However,you cannot change profession here.<br1>
This is because only those who haveexperienced Human society and understand the great world beyond arequalified to change profession.<br1>
For these reasons, you should leave thisforest and go to the Human kingdom of Aden.<br1>
There is a guild secretlybuilt by Dark Elves in the town of Gludio, which is the closest southernland from here.<br1>
The Grand Masters there will change your profession.<br1>
