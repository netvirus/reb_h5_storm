To be qualified to become a Palus Knight, your levelmust be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Palus Knight.<br1>
However, you cannot change profession here.<br1>
This is because only thosewho have experienced Human society and understand the great world beyondthe forest are qualified to change profession.<br1>
For these reasons, youshould leave this forest and go to the Human Kingdom of Aden.<br1>
There is aguild secretly built by Dark Elves in the town of Gludio, which is theclosest southern land from here.<br1>
You should visit the Grand Masters, whoare the highest ranking drillmasters of our guilds, and satisfy theirdemands to be permitted to change profession.<br1>
Also, there are twovillages you can go to from the Dark Forest.<br1>
One is the village ofGludin.<br1>
Even though it is very far from here, you can get there byfollowing the road towards the School of Dark Arts.<br1>
The other way is togo through the Neutral Zone, to come to the town of Gludio, which is alittle closer.<br1>
However, there are many Elves in the Neutral Zone, sothere could be conflicts.<br1>
