The *Shillien Oracle* is a celebrant of darkness whofulfills the oracular prophecies of Shilen by studying darkness anddeath spawned by Shilen, and the spirits of destruction and chaos thatserve her.<br1>
Unlike Human and Elven Priests, who look to the gods oflight, the Shillien Oracle understands the truth of both light anddarkness, and not only can heal companions with white magic andsupplementary magic, but also can curse opponents or steal their energyby means of black magic.<br1>
The most spiritually advanced Shillien Oraclesare chosen as *Shillien Elders*.<br1>
The Shillien Elder is our spiritualleader, and understands the divine natures of Shilen and Gran Kainbetter than anyone else.<br1>
