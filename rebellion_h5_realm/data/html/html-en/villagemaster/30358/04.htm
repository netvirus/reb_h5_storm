*Assassins* are murderers who kill quietly andswiftly, then vanish into the shadows.<br1>
They are also feared spies andnight fighters, who are gifted in concealment and stealth.<br1>
They targetthe enemy's weak points with small, swift weapons like daggers, or shootarrows from a long distance.<br1>
While Palus Knights fight their opponentson the battlefield, Assassins fight enemies of the race in the blackdarkness of moonless night, to claim silent victory.<br1>
The most eliteAssassins are sometimes chosen as *Shadow Stalkers* to learn theultimate secrets of assassination and searching.<br1>
On the other hand, someAssassins are chosen as *Abyss Walker*, and train their archery skillsto the highest level.<br1>
