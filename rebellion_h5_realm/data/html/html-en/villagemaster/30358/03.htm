*Palus Knights* are the elite knights of the DarkElves.<br1>
Their excellent swordsmanship is based on swift, precise attacksand effective defense, and it cannot be compared to other races thatdepend on mere strength or coarser skills.<br1>
The most talented of PalusKnights are selected for the highest order, as a *Shillien Knight*, orbecome *Bladedancers*, with almost unearthly skill in swordsmanship.<br1>
