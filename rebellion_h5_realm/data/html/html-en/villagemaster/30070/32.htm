<font color="FF8000">High Priest Sylvain:</font><br>
You have already far surpassed the abilities ofmost people.<br1>
You cannot now return to such a lowly profession.<br1>
Judgingfrom your strength, I believe that your faith sustains you on your path.<br1>
Keep your faith to the end, and move forward.<br1>
May the will of Einhasadguide you along the path of righteousness.<br1>
