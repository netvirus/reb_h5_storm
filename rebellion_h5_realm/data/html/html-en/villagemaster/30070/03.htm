*Elven Wizards* deeply share feelings with spiritsand practice more powerful and complicated magic than Elven Mages, suchas Elemental Magic, Black Magic and Summoning Magic.<br1>
They command fireand wind to attack enemies, take lives with black magic, and summonspirits of mother nature as 'servitors.<br1>
' Among Elven Wizards, those whowant to study elemental magic become *Spellsingers*, and those who wantto reach the ultimate state of Summoning Magic become *ElementalSummoners*.<br1>
Also, to become an Elven Wizard, you must bring back the*Eternity Diamond* as proof.<br1>
