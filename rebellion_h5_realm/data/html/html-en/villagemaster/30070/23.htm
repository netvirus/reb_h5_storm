You need the appropriate level and token to becomea Human Wizard.<br1>
To change profession, your level must be at least 20,and to become a Wizard, you must have the token that proves that youpassed the Test of the Human Wizard.<br1>
However, it seems your level islower than 20, and you have not yet passed the Test of the Human Wizard.<br1>
The first thing you need to do is train harder to reach level 20.<br1>
If youwant to know about the test, look for *Parina*, who studies elementalmagic at the *temple* in the village of Gludin.<br1>
You must also bring the*bead of four seasons*, which she will award you when you collect thetokens for all four elements.<br1>
