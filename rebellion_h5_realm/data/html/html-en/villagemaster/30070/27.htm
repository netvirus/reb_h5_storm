You need the appropriate level and token to becomea Cleric.<br1>
To change profession, your level must be at least 20, and tobecome a Cleric, you must have the token that proves that you passed theTest of the Cleric.<br1>
However, it seems your level is lower than 20, andyou have not yet passed the Test of the Cleric.<br1>
The first thing you needto do is train harder to reach level 20 or higher.<br1>
Then, if you want totake the test, look for *Priest Zigaunt at the sanctuary in the villageof Gludin*.<br1>
You must pass his test and bring back the *mark of faith* tochange your profession to Cleric.<br1>
As I'm sure you know, you just followthe road west to reach the village of Gludin.<br1>
