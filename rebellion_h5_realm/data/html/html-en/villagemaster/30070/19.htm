You need the appropriate level and token to becomean Elven Oracle.<br1>
To change profession, your level must be at least 20,and to become an Oracle, you must have the token that proves that youpassed the Test of the Elven Oracle.<br1>
However, it seems your level islower than 20, and you have not yet passed the Test of the Elven Oracle.<br1>
The first thing you need to do is train harder to reach level 20.<br1>
Thenyou must pass the test and bring back the *leaf of the Oracle* as proof.<br1>
*Priest Manuel* of our temple, who has taught us Oracles for a longtime, is in charge of the test.<br1>
If you want to know more about the test,speak to Priest Manuel of the town of Gludio*.<br1>
