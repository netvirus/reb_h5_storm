You need the appropriate level and token to becomean Elven Wizard.<br1>
To change profession, your level must be at least 20,and to become an Elven Wizard you must have the token that proves thatyou passed the Test of the Elven Wizard.<br1>
However, it seems your level islower than 20, and you have not yet passed the Test of the Elven Wizard.<br1>
The first thing you need to do is train harder to reach level 20.<br1>
Then,if you wish to become an Elven Wizard, you should visit the Elvenvillage and talk to an Elf called *Rosella*.<br1>
You can change professionto an Elven Wizard only if you pass her test and bring back the tokencalled the *eternity diamond*.<br1>
Rosella is right there in the village, soit won't be hard to find her.<br1>
