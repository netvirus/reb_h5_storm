To change your profession to Human Wizard, youshould bring back tokens for each of the four elements of water, fire,wind and earth -- for these form the basis of elemental magic.<br1>
Visit*Parina*, who has studied elemental magic for a long time, to learn howto collect tokens.<br1>
If you deliver the four tokens, she will give you the*bead of four seasons*.<br1>
She studies at the *temple in the village ofGludin*.<br1>
You will easily find her if you go there.<br1>
