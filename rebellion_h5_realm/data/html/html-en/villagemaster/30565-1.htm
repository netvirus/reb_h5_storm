<font color="FF8000">Flame Lord Kakai:</font><br>
Originally, we Orcs consisted of seven powerfultribes and reigned over the entire world.<br1>
But about 2,000 years ago, weengaged in a large scale war against those despicable Elves.<br1>
Of course,the superiority of our race over any other was unquestionable -- whichis undoubtedly why the Elves allied themselves with those shrewd andcunning humans.<br1>
Their combined treachery defeated us and drove us farfrom our lands.<br1>
Ah, but those arrogant Elves were also betrayed by thehumans and driven deep into the woods.<br1>
The hand that parries can alsothrust, as the saying goes.<br1>
After the war, our people built a new homehere on the *Immortal Plateau*, which was once Pa'agrio's sacred ground,and we have been steadily preparing to reclaim our former glory.<br1>
But*the Ragna Tribe*, one of the seven original tribes, betrayed the rest.<br1>
Their shameful act has tainted our people's honor.<br1>
It is unforgivable!They do not even deserve to be called Orcs.<br1>
