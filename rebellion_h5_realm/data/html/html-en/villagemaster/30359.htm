May the holy darkness of the abyss fill the land.<br1>
I amTetrarch Kaitar, prophet of the darkness chosen by*Gran Kain*, father ofdarkness.<br1>
I follow*Shilen*, mother of the abyss, and am the black priestwho interprets Shilen's will.<br1>
Goddess of death and destiny, Shilensometimes gives me the ability to see into the future.<br1>
For manygenerations my family has been born with the ability to predict thefuture by tossing the bones of the dead and looking at the fallenshapes, or by gazing into the eyes of the dead.<br1>
In the currentsituation, with enemies surrounding us, it is my task to foresee thedisasters that may threaten the future of our race.<br1>
