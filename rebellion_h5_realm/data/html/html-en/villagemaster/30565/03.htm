Basically, to meet the qualifications for an Raider,your level must be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Raider.<br1>
I cannot change your profession for you, however, because only those whohave experienced Human society and understand the great world beyond theplateau are qualified to change profession.<br1>
Know the enemy as you knowyourself, and you will be invincible in battle, the sages say.<br1>
% To takethe Test of the Raider, go to *Prefect Karukia* over there.<br1>
He will tellyou everything you need to know.<br1>
And when you are ready to changeprofession, you must leave this place and go to the *village of Gludin*in the region of Gludio to meet *High Prefect Osborn*.<br1>
If you have thequalifications, he will change your profession.<br1>
