Basically, to be qualified for a Monk, your levelmust be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Monk.<br1>
I cannotchange your profession for you, however, because only those who haveexperienced Human society and understand the great world beyond theplateau are qualified to change profession.<br1>
Know the enemy as you knowyourself, and you will be invincible in battle, the sages say.<br1>
