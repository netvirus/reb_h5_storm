From ancient times, the Elves of Light have lived inharmony with the forest under the protection of the Mother Tree.<br1>
Surrounded by her magic force field, this became their sanctuary fromthe outside world for a long, long time.<br1>
However, the Sea of Spores eastof the forest has been gradually expanding, and the dark brothers of theNorth and the Human kingdom of the South are looking for any excuse totake over our forest! Many of our young brothers feel that we cannotsurvive if we stay isolated in this forest in times like these, andthey've started leaving for the outside world.<br1>
The times demand change,and we can no longer rely entirely on the protection of the forest.<br1>
Ourtribe must experience a broader world view, and most of all we must gainan understanding of the Humans who have come to dominate the continent.<br1>
For this reason, only the Elves who have gained experience and knowledgeof the outside world are qualified to obtain new power.<br1>
