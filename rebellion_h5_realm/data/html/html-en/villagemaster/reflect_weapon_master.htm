A Shadow Weapon is special weapon that is made in cooperation betweenthe Ivory Tower and the Black Anvil Guild.<br1>
It is created by magicallyprojecting the power of a weapon onto another catalytic object.<br1>
Whilethat means that it can only be used while the magic charge remains, ithas made it possible to mass produce projectile weapons.<br1>
Its performanceis no different than if you used the original weapon, except that itcannot possess the special ability to absorb souls or refine through aStone of Life.<br1>
Also, although it acts as a weapon, it is actually in themagic category -- once opened, it cannot be passed on to someone else.<br1>
Consider it an aid on your new path until you lay your hands on somereal weapons.<br1>
