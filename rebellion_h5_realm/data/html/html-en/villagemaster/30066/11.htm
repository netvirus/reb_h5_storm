The *medallion of the Warrior* is a token given only to those who have passed the test to become a Warrior.<br1>
To take the Test of the Warrior, look for *Master Aymus of the village of Gludin*, who has long led the Warriors of his fighter guild.<br1>
You know the village of Gludin, right? Follow the road west and you'll come to the village. It's a splendid place with a large port. The village is very far from here, so it may be better to use a Gatekeeper.<br1>
Master Aymus' guild can be found in the northern part of the village.<br>
