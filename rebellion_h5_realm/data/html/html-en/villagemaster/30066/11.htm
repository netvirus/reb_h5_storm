The *medallion of the Warrior* is a token givenonly to those who have passed the test to become a Warrior.<br1>
To take theTest of the Warrior, look for *Master Aymus of the village of Gludin*,who has long led the Warriors of his fighter guild.<br1>
You know the villageof Gludin, right? Follow the road west and you'll come to the village.<br1>
It's a splendid place with a large port.<br1>

Master Aymus' guild canbe found in the northern part of the village.<br1>
