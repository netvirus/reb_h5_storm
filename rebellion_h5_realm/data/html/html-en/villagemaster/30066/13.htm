Unlike the Warrior, who focuses all energy on a strong attack, the *Human Knight* places more importance on the balance between attack and defense.<br1>
Human Knights have great courage and must be willing to sacrifice all for their companions. With shields and excellent armor, they place themselves between monsters and their companions.<br1>
They are the most faithful protectors of kings and lords. They belong to a very different order than mercenary soldiers, who work for profit. Those who are recognized as great Knights may gain a still higher-level profession, such as the *Paladin* or the *Dark Avenger*. To become a Human Knight, you must pass the Test of the Human Knight and bring back the *sword of ritual* as proof.<br>
