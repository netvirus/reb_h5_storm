Unlike the Warrior, who focuses all energy on astrong attack, the *Human Knight* places more importance on the balancebetween attack and defense.<br1>
Human Knights have great courage and must bewilling to sacrifice all for their companions.<br1>
With shields andexcellent armor, they place themselves between monsters and theircompanions.<br1>
They are the most faithful protectors of kings and lords.<br1>
They belong to a very different order than mercenary soldiers, who workfor profit.<br1>
Those who are recognized as great Knights may gain a stillhigher-level profession, such as the *Paladin* or the *Dark Avenger*.<br1>
Tobecome a Human Knight, you must pass the Test of the Human Knight andbring back the *sword of ritual* as proof.<br1>
