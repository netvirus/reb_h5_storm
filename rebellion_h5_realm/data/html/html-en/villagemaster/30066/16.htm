The *Rogue* is a unique profession among the threechoices Human Fighters are offered.<br1>
They choose agility over theWarrior's power, and profit over the Knight's honor.<br1>
They prefer tocarry small daggers and bows and arrows, and scout enemy camps withouttheir footsteps making any sound.<br1>
It would be a hundred times moredifficult to win battles without them.<br1>
Their missions include scouting,investigating, spying and assassination, among others.<br1>
Rogues with greatfame and reputation can change to the higher-level profession of the*Hawkeye*, who use bows and arrows, or the *Treasure Hunter*, who usesdaggers .<br1>
Of course, it is very difficult to reach that level.<br1>
Tobecome a Rogue, you must also bring a *letter of recommendation from theGuard Captain Bezique*.<br1>
It is a token that shows you are qualified tobecome a Rogue.<br1>
