To become a Rogue, you need the appropriate level and token.<br1>
Your level should be at least 20 to be qualified to change profession.<br1>
You also need a token to prove that you passed the Test of the Rogue, as well as an appropriate level.<br1>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems like you did not pass the Test of the Rogue.<br1>
You can only be accepted as a true Rogue when you pass the test.<br1>
Seek *Captain Bezique of the village of Gludin* to take the test.<br1>
He is at the entrance to the harbor on the west side of the village.<br1>
To become a Rogue, pass his test and bring back his recommendation.
