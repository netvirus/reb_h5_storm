Your level should be at least 20 to be qualified to changeprofession.<br1>
You also need a token to prove that you passed the Test ofthe Rogue, as well as an appropriate level.<br1>

You canonly be accepted as a true Rogue when you pass the test.<br1>
Seek *CaptainBezique of the village of Gludin* to take the test.<br1>
