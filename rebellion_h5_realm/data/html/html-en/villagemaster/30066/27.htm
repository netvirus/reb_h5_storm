To become a Warrior, you need the appropriate level and token.<br1>
Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession.<br1>
To become a Warrior, you need the *medallion of the Warrior* to prove that you passed the Test of the Warrior, as well.<br1>
It seems that you have admirably passed the Test of the Warrior, but your level is not high enough.<br1>
Level 20 or higher is required to change profession.<br1>
I cannot allow you to change profession if your level is not sufficient, even if you have a token. Come back when you have raised your level.
