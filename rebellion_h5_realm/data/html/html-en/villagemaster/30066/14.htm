The *sword of ritual* is a token given to thosewho have passed the Test of the Human Knight.<br1>
The one who receives thesword has earned the right to become a Knight.<br1>
High-ranking Knights ofthe order have been entrusted with the care of the sword of ritual forgenerations.<br1>
Until recently, Sir Collin Windawood cared for the sword,but when he was appointed governor of Talking Island, it was put in thecare of *Sir Klaus Vasper*.<br1>
You should go see him.<br1>
*Sir Vasper* will benear the fighter guild in *the village of Gludin * and it won't bedifficult to find him when you are there.<br1>
You must keep going west, butit is so far that it is faster to use a Gatekeeper.<br1>
You can changeprofession to Human Knight if you pass his test and bring back the*sword of ritual*.<br1>
