*Elven Scouts* are the sentries of the forest, and have protected the Elven home from invaders for thousands of years.<br1>
Since their footsteps are lighter than feathers, they can walk and run over the fallen leaves without making any noise as they approach their opponents.<br1>
They suddenly launch fatal attacks with bows or daggers, then disappear as if into thin air as they blend into the forest. The most talented Elven Scouts are selected as *Plainswalker*, the Ranger elite.<br1>
Others among the Elven Scouts are selected as *Silver Rangers*, and train in the utmost mastery of archery. Of course, much hard training, as well as great talent, is required.<br1>
To become an Elven Scout, you must pass the test and bring back Reisa's Recommendation as proof.<br>
