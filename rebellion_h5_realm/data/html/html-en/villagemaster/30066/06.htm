*Elven Scouts* are the sentries of the forest, andhave protected the Elven home from invaders for thousands of years.<br1>
Since their footsteps are lighter than feathers, they can walk and runover the fallen leaves without making any noise as they approach theiropponents.<br1>
They suddenly launch fatal attacks with bows or daggers, thendisappear as if into thin air as they blend into the forest.<br1>
The mosttalented Elven Scouts are selected as *Plainswalker*, the Ranger elite.<br1>
Others among the Elven Scouts are selected as *Silver Rangers*, andtrain in the utmost mastery of archery.<br1>
Of course, much hard training,as well as great talent, is required.<br1>
To become an Elven Scout, you mustpass the test and bring back Reisa's Recommendation as proof.<br1>
