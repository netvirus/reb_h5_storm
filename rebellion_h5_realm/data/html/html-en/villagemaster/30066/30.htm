To become a Human Knight, you need the appropriate level and token.<br1>
Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession.<br1>
You need a token to prove you have passed the Test of the Human Knight, as well.<br1>
However, it seems that your level is not high enough, and you have not passed the Test of the Human Knight, either.<br1>
First, try to raise your level to 20 or higher.<br1>
If you want to know more about the test, visit *Sir Klaus Vasper*, who is high among the order of Knights.<br1>
He will be somewhere near this guild. You can easily find him outside.<br1>
You can change profession to Human Knight if you pass his test and bring back the *sword of ritual*.
