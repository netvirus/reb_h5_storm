To become a Human Knight, you need the appropriatelevel and token.<br1>
Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to changeprofession.<br1>
You need a token to prove you have passed the Test of theHuman Knight, as well.<br1>
However, it seems that your level is not highenough, and you have not passed the Test of the Human Knight, either.<br1>
First, try to raise your level to 20 or higher.<br1>
If you want to know moreabout the test, visit *Sir Klaus Vasper*, who is high among the order ofKnights.<br1>
He will be somewhere near this guild.<br1>
You can easily find himoutside.<br1>
You can change profession to Human Knight if you pass his testand bring back the *sword of ritual*.<br1>
