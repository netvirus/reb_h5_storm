*Warriors* pursue extreme offensive power.<br1>
Sinceattack power is very important for them, their skills emphasize offense.<br1>
They also have far more HP than those of other professions.<br1>
They oftentake the front line of battle with their great physical strength.<br1>
Warriors who continuously train and build experience can attain thehigher-level profession of the *Warlord* or the *Gladiator*.<br1>
To become aWarrior, you must pass the Test of the Warrior and bring back the*medallion of the Warrior* as proof.<br1>
