To become a Warrior, you need the appropriatelevel and token.<br1>
Your level should be at least 20 to be qualified tochange profession.<br1>
To become a Warrior, you need the *medallion of theWarrior* to prove that you passed the Test of the Warrior, as well as anappropriate level.<br1>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems like youhave not yet passed the Test of the Warrior.<br1>
You will only be acceptedas a true Warrior after you pass the test.<br1>
Go ask *Master Aymus in thevillage of Gludin* about the Test of the Warrior.<br1>
