To become a Warrior, you need the appropriate level and token.<br1>
Your level should be at least 20 to be qualified to change profession.<br1>
To become a Warrior, you need the *medallion of the Warrior* to prove that you passed the Test of the Warrior, as well as an appropriate level.<br1>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems like you have not yet passed the Test of the Warrior.<br1>
You will only be accepted as a true Warrior after you pass the test.<br1>
Go ask *Master Aymus in the village of Gludin* about the Test of the Warrior.
