To become a Knight, you need a token to prove thatyou passed the Test of the Human Knight, in addition to an appropriatelevel.<br1>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems like you did notpass the Test of the Human Knight.<br1>
You can only be accepted as a trueKnight when you pass the test.<br1>
If you want to know more about the test,visit *Sir Klaus Vasper*, who is one of the high-level Knights in the *village of Gludin*.<br1>
He can be found near the fighter guild of Gludin.<br1>
You can change profession to Knight if you pass his test and bring backthe *sword of ritual*.<br1>
