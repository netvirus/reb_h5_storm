To become a Human Knight, you need the appropriate level and token.<br1>
Your level should be at least 20 to be qualified to change profession.<br1>
To become a Knight, you need a token to prove that you passed the Test of the Human Knight, in addition to an appropriate level.<br1>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems like you did not pass the Test of the Human Knight.<br1>
You can only be accepted as a true Knight when you pass the test.<br1>
If you want to know more about the test, visit *Sir Klaus Vasper*, who is one of the high-level Knights in the * village of Gludin*.<br1>
He can be found near the fighter guild of Gludin.<br1>
You can change profession to Knight if you pass his test and bring back the *sword of ritual*.
