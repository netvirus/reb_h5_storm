*Elven Knights* choose swordsmanship over archery.<br1>
It is amazing to watch them fighting, because they use unique styles that emphasize defense as much as attack. Their polished techniques confuse their enemies and mesmerize those who are watching.<br1>
These days, many Elven Knights enter the Human world in the service of Einhasad and Eva, even though they were originally created to protect the Mother Trees from invaders.<br1>
The most talented of Elven Knights are sometimes selected as *Temple Knights*, the highest order of the Elves, or *Swordsingers*, who train Elven swordsmanship to a fine art. Of course, much hard training, as well as great talent, is required.<br1>
To become an Elven Knight, you must pass the Test of the Elven Knight and bring back the *Elven Knight brooch*. The Elven Knight brooch proves that you have the qualifications to become an Elven Knight*.<br>
