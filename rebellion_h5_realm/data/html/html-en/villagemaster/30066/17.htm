These days, *Captain Bezique in the village ofGludin* is in charge of the Test of the Rogue.<br1>
If you pass his test, hewill give you a letter of recommendation.<br1>
Bring me that and you canbecome a Rogue.<br1>
To find Bezique, head west from our village until youcome to the village of Gludin.<br1>
In the east entrance of the village, hewill be on duty.<br1>
Then you can meet him.<br1>
However, the village of Gludinis quite far from here, so using a Gatekeeper will be faster.<br1>
