To become a Warrior, you need the appropriatelevel and token.<br1>
Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to changeprofession.<br1>
You need the *medallion of the Warrior* to prove that youpassed the Test of the Warrior, as well.<br1>
However, it seems that yourlevel is not high enough, and you have not passed the Test of theWarrior, either.<br1>
First, try to raise your level to 20 or higher.<br1>
If youwant to ask about the test, seek *Master Aymus in the village ofGludin*.<br1>
