To qualify to become a Scavenger, your level mustbe at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Scavenger.<br1>
However, youhaven't met either the level or the test requirement yet.<br1>
Go raise yourlevel and take the Test of the Scavenger.<br1>
Ask *Collector Pippi of theDwarven village* about the test.<br1>
She will tell you everything you needto know about it in detail.<br1>
After you have passed the test and increasedyour level, come back to me.<br1>
Then I will change your profession to aScavenger.<br1>
