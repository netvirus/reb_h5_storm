Haven't I explained this to you? You must be atleast level 20 to become a Scavenger.<br1>
It seems that you have admirablypassed the Test of the Scavenger, but your level is not high enough.<br1>
Level 20 or higher is required to change profession.<br1>
I cannot allow youto change profession if your level is not sufficient, even if you havepassed the test.<br1>
Go out and kill some monsters to increase your levelbefore coming back.<br1>
