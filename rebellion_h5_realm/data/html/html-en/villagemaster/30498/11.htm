I am Warehouse Chief Moke of the Iron GateGuild.<br1>
I am a respected Dwarf who teaches Dwarven Fighters andScavengers.<br1>
What has brought you to me? Surely you didn't come to mebecause you thought you could learn something from me, did you? With theslow minds of your race, you cannot catch up with the Dwarves' economicabilities, commercial sense, or keen understanding of money.<br1>
Now thatyou know, go back to your sword fighting or haughty magic -- whateveryou want.<br1>
