To become a Scavenger, you must be at least level20 and must pass the Test of the Scavenger.<br1>
I am satisfied with yourlevel, but it seems that you have not yet passed the Test of theScavenger.<br1>
Ask *Collector Pippi of the Dwarven village* about the test.<br1>
She will tell you everything you need to know about it in detail.<br1>
Afteryou have passed the test, come to me.<br1>
Then I will change your professionto a Scavenger.<br1>
