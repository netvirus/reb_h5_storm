You need the appropriate level and token tobecome an Elven Wizard.<br1>
To change profession, your level must be atleast 20, and to become an Elven Wizard you must have the token thatproves that you passed the Test of the Elven Wizard.<br1>
However, it seemsyour level is lower than 20, and you have not yet passed the Test of theElven Wizard.<br1>
The first thing you need to do is train harder to reachlevel 20.<br1>
Then, if you wish to become an Elven Wizard, you should visitthe Elven village and talk to an Elf named *Rosella*.<br1>
You can changeprofession to an Elven Wizard only if you pass her test and bring backthe token called the *eternity diamond*.<br1>
Rosella is right there in thevillage, so it won't be hard to find her.<br1>
