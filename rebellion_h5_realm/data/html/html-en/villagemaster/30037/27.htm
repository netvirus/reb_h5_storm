You need the appropriate level and token to become a Cleric.<br1>
To change profession, your level must be at least 20, and to become a Cleric, you must have the token that proves that you passed the Test of the Cleric.<br1>
However, it seems your level is lower than 20, and you have not yet passed the Test of the Cleric.<br1>
The first thing you need to do is train harder to reach level 20 or higher.<br1>
If you want to know more about the Test of the Cleric, go to *Priest Zigaunt* of our temple.<br1>
He will test your faith. To change profession to become a Cleric, you must pass his test and bring back the *mark of faith* as proof.
