To become an Elven Wizard, you must bring back the *eternity diamond* as proof of your worthiness.<br1>
This means you have earned the right to become an Elven Wizard.<br1>
If you go to the Elven village and meet the Elf *Rosella*, she will give you the test.<br1>
You must pass her test to become an Elven Wizard.<br1>
Since Rosella is in the village, it won't be hard to find her.<br>
