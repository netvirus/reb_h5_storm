The *Elven Oracle* is the Elven Mystic whocontrols spirits of light, life, innocence and purification, derivedfrom the divinity of Einhasad and Eva.<br1>
These priests give spiritualadvice to other Elves.<br1>
They practice the arts of white magic andsupplementary magic, which offer powerful means of protecting andhealing themselves and their fellows, rather than attacking enemies.<br1>
Among Elven Oracles, those who are spiritually gifted could become*Elven Elders*.<br1>
Elven Elders are the most advanced priests to receivethe blessings of Einhasad and Eva.<br1>
They practice the most powerful whitemagic.<br1>
But first, to become an Elven Oracle, you must pass the Test ofthe Elven Oracle and bring back the *leaf of the Oracle* as proof ofyour accomplishment.<br1>
