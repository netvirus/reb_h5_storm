<font color="FFFF00">High Priestess Levian:</font><br>
The *Elven Oracle* is the Elven Mystic who controls spirits of light, life, innocence and purification, derived from the divinity of Einhasad and Eva. These priests give spiritual advice to other Elves.<br1>
They practice the arts of white magic and supplementary magic, which offer powerful means of protecting and healing themselves and their fellows, rather than attacking enemies.<br>
Among Elven Oracles, those who are spiritually gifted could become *Elven Elders*.<br1>
Elven Elders are the most advanced priests to receive the blessings of Einhasad and Eva.<br1>
They practice the most powerful white magic. But first, to become an Elven Oracle, you must pass the Test of the Elven Oracle and bring back the *leaf of the Oracle* as proof of your accomplishment.<br>
