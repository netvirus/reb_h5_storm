*Elven Wizards* enjoy a deep connection to the spirits of nature, and practice more powerful and complicated magic than Elven Mystics.<br1>
These arts include elemental magic, black magic and summoning magic.<br1>
They command fire and wind to attack enemies, take opponents' lives with black magic, and summon the spirits of mother nature as servitors.<br1>
Among Elven Wizards, those who want to study elemental magic become *Spellsingers*, and those who want to reach the ultimate heights of summoning magic become *Elemental Summoners*.<br1>
Also, to become an Elven Wizard, you must bring back the *eternity diamond* as proof of your worthiness.<br>
