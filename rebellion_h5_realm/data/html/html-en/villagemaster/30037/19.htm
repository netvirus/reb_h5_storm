You need the appropriate level and token to become an Elven Oracle.<br1>
To change profession, your level must be at least 20, and to become an Oracle, you must have the token that proves that you passed the Test of the Elven Oracle.<br1>
However, it seems your level is lower than 20, and you have not yet passed the Test of the Elven Oracle.<br1>
The first thing you need to do is train harder to reach level 20.<br1>
Then you must pass the test and bring back the *leaf of the Oracle* as proof.<br1>
To take the test, go to *Priest Manuel, who can be found in the sanctuary of the town of Gludio*.<br1>
To get to the town of Gludio, follow the road to the east.<br1>
You must pass his test and bring back the *leaf of the Oracle*.
