You need the appropriate level and token tobecome an Elven Oracle.<br1>
To change profession, your level must be atleast 20, and to become an Oracle, you must have the token that provesthat you passed the Test of the Elven Oracle.<br1>
However, it seems yourlevel is lower than 20, and you have not yet passed the Test of theElven Oracle.<br1>
The first thing you need to do is train harder to reachlevel 20.<br1>
Then you must pass the test and bring back the *leaf of theOracle* as proof.<br1>
To take the test, go to *Priest Manuel, who can befound in the sanctuary of the town of Gludio*.<br1>
To get to the town ofGludio, follow the road to the east.<br1>
You must pass his test and bringback the *leaf of the Oracle*.<br1>
