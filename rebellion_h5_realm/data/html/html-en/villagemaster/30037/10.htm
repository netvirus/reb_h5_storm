The *Human Wizard* is an advanced Mystic who can practice elemental magic, black magic and summoning magic. Also, the Human Wizard can directly strike down enemies with the most powerful magic.<br1>
However, the Wizard must turn away from the arts of white magic and summoning magic in order to concentrate on attack magic.<br1>
Nevertheless, it's quite a fascinating profession, particularly in its ability to summon servitors.<br1>
Some Wizards decide to train at Oren's Ivory Tower, to attain still more advanced professions, such as *Sorcerers, Warlocks or Necromancers*. However, there are not many that can achieve such a high level, it is not as easy as you think.<br1>
To change profession to become a Human Wizard, you must bring back the *bead of four seasons*.<br1>
That is a token that proves that you have attained the qualifications to become a Human Wizard.<br>
