The *Cleric* is a Human Mystic who is connected to the divine power that surrounds the world.<br1>
The Cleric performs miracles through the power of the gods.<br1>
Thus, the Cleric practices mostly white magic and supplementary magic to help others.<br1>
However, Clerics are granted some attack skills to protect themselves.<br1>
Also, the Cleric has great healing powers and for this gift they are always welcomed and respected.<br1>
Those Clerics who continue in their training and in the service of others can attain higher professions, such as *Bishop* or *Prophet*.<br1>
But first, to become a Cleric, you must bring back the *Mark of Faith* to show that your faith has been acknowledged.<br>
