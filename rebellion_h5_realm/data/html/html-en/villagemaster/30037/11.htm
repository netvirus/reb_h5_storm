To change your profession to Human Wizard, you should bring back tokens for each of the four elements of water, fire,
wind and earth -- for these form the basis of elemental magic.<br1>
Visit *Parina*, who has long studied elemental magic, to learn how to collect the tokens.<br1>
She is here in this temple, so you can meet her immediately.<br1>
You will receive the *bead of four seasons* when you collect tokens for all four elements.<br1>
If you bring me that, you can change profession to become a Human Wizard.<br>
