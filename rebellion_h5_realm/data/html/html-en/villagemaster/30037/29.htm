You need the appropriate level and token tobecome a Cleric.<br1>
To change profession, your level must be at least 20, and to become a Cleric, you must have the token that proves you have passed the Test of the Cleric.<br1>
You have achieved a sufficient level, but it seems you have not yet passed the test.<br1>
You will be acknowledged as a true Cleric only when you have proved your faith in the Test of the Cleric.<br1>
*Priest Zigaunt* of our temple is in charge of making that determination. He will test your faith.<br1>
To change profession to become a Cleric, you must pass his test and bring back the *mark of faith* as proof.
