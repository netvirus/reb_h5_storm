You need the appropriate level and token to become a Human Wizard.<br1>
To change profession, your level must be at least 20, and to become a Human Wizard, you must have the token that proves that you passed the Test of the Human Wizard.<br1>
However, it seems your level is lower than 20, and you have not yet passed the Test of the Human Wizard.<br1>
The first thing you need to do is train harder to reach level 20.<br1>
Also, you must gather the tokens of the four elements for the test.<br1>
Visit *Parina* in our sanctuary to learn more about collecting the tokens.<br1>
To change profession to become a Human Wizard, you should bring back the *bead of four seasons* which you will receive when you have all four tokens.
