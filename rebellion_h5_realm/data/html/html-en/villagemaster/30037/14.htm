<font color="FFFF00">High Priestess Levian:</font><br>
To become a Cleric, one's faith must be verified.<br1>
I always leave the judgement in this matter in the hands of *Priest Zigaunt*, who has devout faith.<br1>
I suggest you speak to Priest Zigaunt here in our temple.<br1>
To change profession to Cleric, you must pass his test and bring back the *mark of faith* as proof.<br>
