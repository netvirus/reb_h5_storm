To change profession to Cleric, your level must atleast be 20 and you must pass the Test of the Cleric.<br1>
Even when you havepassed the test, though, you cannot change profession here.<br1>
It isimportant that those who are ready for a new profession should haveexperienced some of the wider world.<br1>
To change profession, you should goto the Kingdom of Aden by boat.<br1>
There is a harbor southwest of here --take a boat there that goes to the village of Gludin.<br1>
Get off at the*village of Gludin* and visit the temple to meet *High PriestessLevian*.<br1>
High Priestess Levian will test your ability and, if you areready, can change your profession to Cleric.<br1>
Or, you can visit *HighPriest Raymond in the town of Gludio*, to the west of the village ofGludin.<br1>
