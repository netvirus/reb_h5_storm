<font color="FF8000">Tetrarch Talloth:</font><br>
Patriarch Mitraell is our leader who rules the entireclan.<br1>
He is the Sorcerer who inherited the secrets of black magic fromthe powerful Dasparion.<br1>
He also holds the ultimate magical power, due toa contract with Drevanul.<br1>
When war with the Elves of light was at itsheight, Human Mystics took sides with the Elves of light and cast strongsealing spells on Mitraell.<br1>
Because of this, the morale of our forceswas broken, and just as we were about to win the war, we had no choicebut to retreat.<br1>
Our Patriarch was a political leader, but also thecentral source of the black magic used by our race.<br1>
Losing that powermeant that our magic was greatly weakend.<br1>
We four Tetrarchs all servedMitraell in the past and are constantly looking for a way to undo hisseal.<br1>
