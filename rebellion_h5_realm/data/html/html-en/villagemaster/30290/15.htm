To become a Palus Knight, you need the appropriatelevel and token.<br1>
Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to changeprofession.<br1>
You need a token to prove you have passed the Test of thePalus Knight, as well.<br1>
However, it seems your level is not high enough,and you have not passed the Test of the Palus Knight, either.<br1>
First,raise your level to 20 or higher.<br1>
Also, seek *Master Virgil* of ourguild in the *town of Gludio* to take the test.<br1>
You can changeprofession to Palus Knight only after you take his test and bring backthe *gaze of the abyss* as proof.<br1>
You can get to the town of Gludio byfollowing the road towards the east.<br1>
Of course, using a Gatekeeper isfaster.<br1>
