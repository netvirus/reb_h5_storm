To become a Palus Knight, you need the appropriatelevel and token.<br1>
Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to changeprofession.<br1>
You also need a token to prove you have passed the Test ofthe Palus Knight, as well.<br1>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seemsthat you have not passed the Test of the Palus Knight.<br1>
Go to *MasterVirgil* in the *town of Gludio* to take the test.<br1>
You can changeprofession to a Palus Knight only after you take his test and bring backthe *gaze of the abyss* as proof.<br1>
You can get to the town of Gludio byfollowing the road towards the east.<br1>
Of course, using a Gatekeeper isfaster.<br1>
