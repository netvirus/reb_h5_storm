*Palus Knights* are the elite knights of the DarkElves.<br1>
Their excellent swordsmanship is based on swift, precise attacksand effective defense, and it cannot be compared to other races thatdepend on mere strength or coarser skills.<br1>
Many of the most talented ofPalus Knights are selected for the highest order, as a *ShillienKnight*, or become *Bladedancers*, with almost unearthly skill inswordsmanship.<br1>
To become a Palus Knight, you must pass the test andbring back the *gaze of the abyss* as proof.<br1>
