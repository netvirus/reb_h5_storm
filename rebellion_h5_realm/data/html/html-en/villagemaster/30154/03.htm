*Elven Knights* choose swordsmanship over archery.<br1>
It is amazing to watch them fighting, because they use unique stylesthat emphasize defense as much as attack.<br1>
Their polished techniquesconfuse their enemies and mesmerize those who are watching.<br1>
These days,many Elven Knights enter the Human world in the service of Einhasad andEva, even though they were originally created to protect the MotherTrees from invaders.<br1>
The most talented of Elven Knights are sometimesselected as *Temple Knights*, the highest order of the Elves, or*Swordsingers*, who train Elven swordsmanship to a fine art.<br1>
Of course,much hard training, as well as great talent, is required.<br1>
