To become an Elven Oracle, your level must be atleast 20, and you must pass the Test of the Elven Oracle.<br1>
Remember, evenif you earn the qualifications we cannot change your profession here.<br1>
That is because it s our wish for young Elves to go out beyond theforest, to experience Human society and understand the larger world.<br1>
Therefore, if you wish to change occupations, you must leave the ElvenForest and go to the Human kingdom of Aden.<br1>
The nearest place for achange of profession is *Gludio Castle Town.<br1>
* Look for the *High PriestRaymond* at the temple.<br1>
He will change your occupation, if you areready.<br1>
