To become an Elven Wizard, your level must be atleast 20 and you must pass the Test of the Elven Wizard.<br1>
The Elf*Rosella* is in charge of testing young Elves who aspire to be ElvenWizards.<br1>
If you want to know more about the test, go to her.<br1>
Remember,even if you earn the qualifications, we cannot change your occupationhere.<br1>
That is because we wish for young Elves to go out beyond theforest, to experience Human society and understand the larger world.<br1>
Therefore, if you wish to change occupations, you must leave the ElvenForest and go to the Human kingdom of Aden.<br1>
The nearest place for achange of profession is *Gludio*, which is located in the south of theforest.<br1>
If you follow the road and cross the Neutral Zone, you willcross a bridge and come to a *Gludio Castle Town.<br1>
* Look for *High PriestRaymond* at the temple.<br1>
He will change your occupation, if you areready.<br1>
