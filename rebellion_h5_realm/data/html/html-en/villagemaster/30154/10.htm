To become an Elven Scout, your level must be atleast 20 and you must pass the Test of the Elven Scout.<br1>
Remember, evenif you earn the qualifications we cannot change your profession here.<br1>
That is because it is our wish for young Elves to go out beyond theforest, to experience Human society and understand the larger world.<br1>
Therefore, if you wish to change profession, you must leave the ElvenForest and go to the Human kingdom of Aden.<br1>
The nearest place for achange of profession is *Gludio*, which is located in the south of theforest.<br1>
If you follow the road and cross the neutral zone, you willcross a bridge and come to a town -- the *town of Gludio*.<br1>
Find *GrandMaster Rains* of the fighter guild there.<br1>
He will change your professionwhen you are ready.<br1>
