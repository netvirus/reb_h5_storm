<font color="FF8000">Tetrarch Talloth:</font><br>
May the authority of Gran Kain command the world.<br1>
Iam Tetrarch Talloth of the Dark Elves -- heir of the dark RunsordVellisark and the royal knight of*Patriarch Mitraell*.<br1>
I am the envoy ofGran Kain who leads the hosts of darkness to the battlefield.<br1>
A thousandyears have passed since Mitraell was sealed away by the wicked schemesof Wizards in the Ivory Tower.<br1>
I have been staying at this place wherehe lies, and have cared for his safety and guarded him from danger eversince.<br1>
When he is free, we will gain victory over the dark temple andrule the continent once more.<br1>
