<br>A class transfer occurs when someone with the necessary	abilities and experience is promoted to a more advanced profession.<br1>
No	Warehouse Chief or Head Blacksmith on this island can complete the	transfer, but I can give you the information you'll need.<br1>
If you are a	Dwarven Fighter, you can transfer to a	<font color="LEVEL">Scavenger</font> or an	<font color="LEVEL">Artisan</font>.<br1>
Which one would you like to know	more about?	<br>	<a		action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link villagemaster/32171/warehouse_chief_hufran006fa.<br1>
