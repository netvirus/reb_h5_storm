<br>To meet the qualifications for Scavenger, you must have at	least achieved level 20 and have passed the Scavenger test.<br1>
<br>However, even those basic requirements aren't enough -- only	those who understand the great world beyond the plateau are truyly	qualified to complete a class transfer and become empowered to control	the world's economy.<br1>
<br>To take the test, speak with	<font color="LEVEL">Collector Pippi</font> of the Bronze Key Guild in	the Dwarven Village.<br1>
The Newbie Travel Token will help you.<br1>
<br>She will tell you everything you need to know.<br1>
Once you have	met the qualifications, go to	<font color="LEVEL">Gludin Village</font> and meet	<font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Chief Moke</font>.<br1>
If he deems you	worthy, he will transfer you to Scavenger.<br1>
