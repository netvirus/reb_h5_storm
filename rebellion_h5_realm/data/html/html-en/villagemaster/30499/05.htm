Look here, didn't I tell you before? To obtainthe qualifications to become an Artisan, your level must be at least be20 and you must pass the Test of the Artisan.<br1>
You haven't done eitherone.<br1>
Go and take the Test of the Artisan.<br1>
Ask *Blacksmith Silvery in theDwarven village* about it.<br1>
She is the judge of the first test.<br1>
If youask, she'll tell you everything you need to know.<br1>
After you have passedthe test and raised your level, come to me.<br1>
I will change yourprofession to Artisan.<br1>
You still have a long way to go.<br1>
