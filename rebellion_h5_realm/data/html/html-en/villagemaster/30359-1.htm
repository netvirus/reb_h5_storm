*Gran Kain* -- Sovereign of Destruction, Father ofDarkness! If the sunlight that pierces our eyes was made by Einhasad,then the darkness that swallows the light was made by the Dark Lord,Gran Kain.<br1>
Other races call Gran Kain a devil, fear him and exclude hisfollowers.<br1>
However, as the late afternoon shadow slowly overtakes theland, the power of Gran Kain will surpass all other gods -- and when thelight is put out, flames extinguished, and the wind dies, the groundwill part and all rivers and oceans will become dry.<br1>
Then, only darknesswill remain.<br1>
