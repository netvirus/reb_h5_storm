Shilen, Mother of the Abyss, is the Goddess whocontrols fate and death.<br1>
Shilen permits all life to be limited, and itis she who enables death, so that all living things can return to theiroriginal state of nothingness.<br1>
Other races do not understand the eternalcycle of birth and death.<br1>
They only see one side of death, and fear andhate Shilen.<br1>
Because of these prejudices, in the Human Kingdom, the markof Shilen hanging around one's neck will lead to being burnt at thestake for heresy.<br1>
In spite of this persecution, there are secret groupsof Humans who follow the goddess Shilen.<br1>
In a sense, their faith is thesame as the Dark Elves.<br1>
If only we could know who they were.<br1>
