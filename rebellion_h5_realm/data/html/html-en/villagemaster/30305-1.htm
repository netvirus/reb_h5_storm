Enlightenment is followed by sacrifice.<br1>
If you lookback on the history of our race, you will truly realize the truth ofthis teaching.<br1>
When the *great Sorcerer Dasparion* came to us a thousandyears ago and proposed to teach us black magic, we did not anticipatethe sacrifice we would have to pay in the future and accepted hisproposal.<br1>
When we were at war with the Elves of the light, the blackmagic spells we cast wiped out the innocent Elves of the trees, due toDasparion's malicious plots.<br1>
While the Elves of the trees died, theycursed us with all their remaining strength.<br1>
As a result, our beautifulforest withered, our skin became scorched by the sun, and we went blindand became the race of the Dark.<br1>
For hundreds of years, we lived hiddenunderground.<br1>
Now the curse of the Dark Elves has been broken and we liveabove the ground, but we must not forget the high price we paid to earnstrength.<br1>
