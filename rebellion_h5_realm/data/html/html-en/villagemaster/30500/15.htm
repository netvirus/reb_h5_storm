Basically, to qualify as a Monk, your level mustbe at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Monk.<br1>
I am satisfiedwith your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of theMonk yet.<br1>
To take the test, go to the Orc named *Gantaki Zu Urutu of theOrc village*.<br1>
He will tell you everything you need to know.<br1>
After youpass the test, come to me and I will change your profession.<br1>
Use theGatekeeper to go to the Orc village.<br1>
