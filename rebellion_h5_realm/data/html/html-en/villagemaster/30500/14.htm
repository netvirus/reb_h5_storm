Basically, to be qualified for a Monk, your levelmust be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Monk.<br1>
It seemsthat you have passed the Test of the Monk, but your level is not highenough.<br1>
Level 20 or higher is required to change profession.<br1>
I cannotallow you to change profession if your level is not sufficient, eventhough you have a token.<br1>
Come back when you have increased your level.<br1>
