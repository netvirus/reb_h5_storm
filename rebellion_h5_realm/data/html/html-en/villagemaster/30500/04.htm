*Monks* are priests that devote themselves to thepath of flame.<br1>
Unlike Raiders, they do not rely on swords or largeweapons, but use their own bodies as weapons of war.<br1>
Because they do notdepend on weapons or armor, they learn many skills to protect them selves.<br1>
The finest Monks are selected to become *Tyrants*, for stillmore advanced physical and technical training.<br1>
