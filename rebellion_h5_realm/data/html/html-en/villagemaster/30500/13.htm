Basically, to be qualified for a Monk, your levelmust be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Monk.<br1>
However, itseems that your level is not high enough, and you have not yet passedthe test of the Monk.<br1>
First, work to raise your level to 20 or higher.<br1>
To take the Test of the Monk, seek the Orc named *Gantaki Zu Urutu ofthe Orc village*.<br1>
He will tell you everything you need to know.<br1>
Afteryou pass the test, come to me and I will change your profession.<br1>
Use theGatekeeper to go to the Orc village.<br1>
