To become an Raider, the appropriate level andtoken are required.<br1>
Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to changeprofession.<br1>
You need a token to prove you have passed the Test of theRaider, as well.<br1>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that youhave not passed the Test of the Raider.<br1>
To take the test, go to *PrefectKarukia of the Orc village*.<br1>
He will tell you everything you need toknow.<br1>
If you pass the test and come back, I will change your profession.<br1>
To get to the Orc village, use a Gatekeeper.<br1>
