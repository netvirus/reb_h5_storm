/font><br>The Chamber of Delusion is a dream maze discoverednot long ago.<br1>
<br1>Like Rim Kamaloka, it is presumed to be the power ofdarkness invading our world.<br1>
<br1>It exists in the empty space between dreamworlds.<br1>
<br1>In terms of shape and structure, we presume it is related to the*Dimensional Rift*, but we don't know details.<br1>
<br1>What we do know is thatthere are rewards for defeating the enemies who inhabit this place.<br1>
<br1>Ifyou have the courage, perhaps you would be interested in challenging theChamber of Delusion.<br1>
