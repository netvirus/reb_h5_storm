People shouldn't spread false rumors!<br1>
I've heard them all before... devil worshippers , vampires, blah blah blah... The ravings of drunks! This town is well-protected by our royal guards!<br1>
Don't worry! Who is spreading these lies? If you hear anyone saying such rubbish, tell me immediately! I know you wouldn't be so stupid as to do it! The rich people in this town take a very dim view of such groundless fearmongering!<br1>
If I were you, I'd watch what I say!<br>
