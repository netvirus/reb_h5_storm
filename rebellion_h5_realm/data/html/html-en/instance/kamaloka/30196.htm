<font color="0040FF">Captain Mouen:</font><br>
Young traveler, welcome to Oren! I am Mouen, responsibleto the lord for the security of the town.<br1>
As you know, we are close toAden's enemy, the land of Elmore, so security is tighter here than inmost towns.<br1>
Let me apologize now for any inconvenience this may causeyou.<br1>
Please understand, the residents here are not very different ineither appearance or customs, to our neighbors to the north.<br1>
In fact, tothose who make their living cutting down trees, national boundaries meanlittle.<br1>
Off the top of my head, I can name at least 10 residents whohave relatives or friends in Elmore! That imposing castle on thenorthern hill, that's Oren Castle.<br1>
Whenever I look at it, I pray thatElmore recognizes its power so our residents will not have to suffer thecalamity of war ever again.<br1>
