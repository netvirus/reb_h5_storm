Greetings, I am Rovia.<br1>
This place is right on the borderwith Elmore, that is why the houses and people may seem rather foreign.<br1>
Quite different from the Elves, wouldn't you say? The houses are crudeand rough and the men are far from refined.<br1>
The further you go intoElmore, the more you'll find the culture to be crude.<br1>
It's very hard foran Elf to feel at home here, harmony with nature is not exactly revered.<br1>
