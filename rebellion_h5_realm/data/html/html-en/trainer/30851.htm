I was hearing things before about the Tower of Insolencehaving collapsed but it has now been confirmed.<br1>
As soon as those ruinswere opened to ordinary people, everybody showed up to kill stuff.<br1>
There's nothing more dangerous than that.<br1>
That tower is a graveyard forthose that are not adequately prepared normally.<br1>
