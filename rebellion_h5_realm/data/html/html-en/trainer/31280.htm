Since ancient times, the people of Elmore have nurturedand venerated the military arts.<br1>
and not just the residents! TheEinhasad Temple of Goddard shares a building with the Warrior guild, andhas even given them their full support! Naturally, this doesn't meanthat we endorse violence! But history has taught us that in order tomaintain peace and harmony, we must keep our military strong.<br1>
