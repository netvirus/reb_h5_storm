This Hunters' Village has something like anuncompromising attitude of mind, characteristic of anarchy.<br1>
As you knowyou can catch various strange creatures, right? Not just because ofthat, but Lords of various regions tried very hard to control thisvillage.<br1>
However, every time they tried they only heard things damagingtheir pride.<br1>
The biggest mistake made by them began from amisunderstanding.<br1>

Rememberthat.<br1>
