Ah, I made a slip of the tongue! Priest Potter isactually my elder twin brother.<br1>
Unlike me, he is always calm and quiet.<br1>
Ah, you asked what the Twins Temple means, didn't you? Well, hereYohanes and Baulro are twins, and so are Potter and I.<br1>
It may be acoincidence, but the village people joke that the temple is the TwinsTemple.<br1>
By the way, they don't talk that way around High Priest Biotin.<br1>
He dislikes it when people make jokes about this holy temple.<br1>
