Did you say Hardin? I've been friends with thatguy for a very long time.<br1>
But I still don't know much about him.<br1>
Sometimes he leaves this academy and goes out for a long time.<br1>
And whenhe does that, even I don't know where or what he's doing.<br1>
But that issomething that would definitely surprise an ordinary person likeyourself.<br1>
Based on Human standards, he acts very properly and justly.<br1>
But in fact, he doesn't think of that as being even as important as thehair of an undead.<br1>
I believe that someone like him is in a region thatis not effected by laws, norms and ethics.<br1>
