To the north of this village is a massive ravine.<br1>
Thatplace is a gathering place for dragons such as worms or drakes; so itwas named the Dragon Valley.<br1>
Many hunters desiring a worm's scales or adrake's claw rashly venture into that valley, only to lose their lives.<br1>
That is because the green dragon Antharas has summoned malignant spiritsto protect its home.<br1>
If you are thinking of going there, you must beespecially careful.<br1>
