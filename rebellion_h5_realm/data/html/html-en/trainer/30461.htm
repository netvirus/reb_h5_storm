What was your first impression of Dion like? I don'tknow if you felt it, but Dion is a land overflowing with magical power.<br1>
In my opinion, it has to do with the ruins of the giants to the north ofthe village.<br1>
The giants of ere are known to have been the mostremarkable race.<br1>
Their mysterious power may be related to the magicalpower of this land.<br1>
