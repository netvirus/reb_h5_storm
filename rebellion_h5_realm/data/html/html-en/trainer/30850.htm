Because of the Dwarven bandits called the Magpie Brothers,the National Cemetary has fallen into disrepair recently.<br1>
And all kindsof followers have appeared too.<br1>
.<br1>
The divine protection given to theDwarves by Maphr is not so that they can dig in the ground and get thethings that are buried in graves.<br1>
Not long ago, I gave training to theguards in Dwarven techniques of capture.<br1>
