The evil that oppresses us is none other than thegreen dragon Antharas.<br1>
It nests in the deepest part of the DragonValley.<br1>
My sister Juris and I teach magic to our Elven brothers in theguild here, but we are also charged with the task of keeping watch onAntharas' movements.<br1>
If Antharas erupts again, the surrounding land willbe covered with destruction and death.<br1>
Therefore, we cannot be lazyabout precautions.<br1>
