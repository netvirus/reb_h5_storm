What does it look to you like I'm doing here? Why doI have to listen to every kind of stupid question?.<br1>
I am working toraise up the young scholars here.<br1>
It means I'm passing on the necromancytechniques that I've learned in the past.<br1>
But don't get all afraid, now.<br1>
The stories about Liches eating the bodies of Humans are just uselessrumors.<br1>
Of course, I tried that as an experiment once, but.<br1>
Since webasically don't apply our magic to undead, we have no reason to eatHumans.<br1>
Not only that, but Hardin has taken hold of my weakness.<br1>
Andso I've kind of got to follow the morality and norms of humans anyway.<br1>
