<font color="FF8000">Prefect Marestella:</font><br>
Us Orcs have come to Aden following the request ofthe king of the weak Humans.<br1>
At any age, Orcs like it for Humans toregret their mistakes and express sincerity to Orcs but is this reallythe case now? In order to avoid being abused yet again by wily humans,everybody is going to have to pay attention.<br1>
Haven't we been terriblydisappointed with the creatures called Humans in the past?! I am PrefectMarestella and I will be the eye of the prefect of fire watching overHumans in the capital city of the Human kingdom.<br1>
