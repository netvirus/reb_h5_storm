<font color="FF8000">Magister Gaius:</font><br>
I don't think that you're somebody I can teach.<br1>
Whydon't you go upstairs? Gauen is younger that other Elves, but he mightbe an excellent teacher for you.<br1>
On the other hand, there is alsoKaiena.<br1>
She may be a little difficult to deal with at times, but she isan accomplished magus.<br1>
Be aware that we don't deal with clerics here.<br1>
Ifthat is your calling, you'd best go to a temple.<br1>
