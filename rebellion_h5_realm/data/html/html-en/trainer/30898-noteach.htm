<font color="0040FF">Blacksmith Morning:</font><br>
What a nerve! Can't you see how busy I am? What withcreating and selling my wares, how would I find the time to teachanyone? Wait, are you a Dwarf? Hmm.<br1>
I see.<br1>
If you're an Artisan or aWarsmith, I suppose I could spare enough time to give you a lesson.<br1>
But it won't come cheap.<br1>
Tell you what, give me 100 milion adena and Iwill give you a special lesson while the Head Blacksmith is away.<br1>
