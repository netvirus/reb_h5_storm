Half of the Ivory Tower was once destroyed during theElmoraden Empire.<br1>
At that time the Ivory Tower had enough power tocontrol the continent, but after that incident it changed in to afacility which purely did research and education.<br1>
Other Magisters saythat we must try hard to restore our old regime, but I personally thinkthat the way the Ivory Tower functions today is better.<br1>
