May the blessings of the starlight be upon you.<br1>
I amvery happy to meet one of my own people in such a distant land.<br1>
It hasalready been fifty years since I have come into the Human world to teachdiscipline.<br1>
Before I knew it, I became accustomed to this life here,but I still miss the forest and lakes of my home.<br1>
However, one must notbe lazy in one s development outside of the Mother Tree's shade.<br1>
Let sbegin the class right away.<br1>
