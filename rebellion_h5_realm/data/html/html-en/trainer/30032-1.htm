<font color="36DC25">Priest Yohanes:</font><br>
Einhasad, the goddess of light, is the mother of allgood and the maker of Humans.<br1>
Einhasad has always been the protector ofjustice, righteousness and goodness.<br1>
Like our father, who became abishop, my twin Baulro and I both serve Einhasad with all our hearts.<br1>
Baulro is walking the path of a Sorcerer instead of a Priest, but hisfaith is no less than mine.<br1>
