Bow respectfully to the name of the flame!! I greet you! Iam the trainer of the flame! I was sent to Gludio Castle Town, and I amin charge of cultivating the noble spirit of the Orc.<br1>
You will see manyOrcs throughout the world who abandoned their pride, honor, andprivilege, and live like worms.<br1>
Turek, Enku, and Vuku are some examples!They should be cursed!! How can they abandon the lofty spirit of theflame and degrade themselves!! You should never forget what happened tothem, and make every effort to prevent it from ever happening again.<br1>
