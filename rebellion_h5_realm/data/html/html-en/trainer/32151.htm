Tejakar Oroka! Welcome, brother.<br1>
I know that even the airof this foreign land makes you uncomfortable, but what can be done? Thatis how the world is.<br1>
At least, the Kamael here are easy to talk to.<br1>
Someone like Zerstorer Marcela has similar philosophy about weapons aswe do, so if you play to remain here for a while, I advise that you meethim.<br1>
Ah, but I see now that you have the look of one about to embark ona journey.<br1>
If that is the case it would be better to concentrate on themainland rather than this tiny island.<br1>
