You do not need to worry, but the Grand Magister Fairenon the 4th floor is very sensitive these days because he is havingdreadful dreams lately, so be careful.<br1>
Can you a imagine how a Dark Elfwill act if he is actually 'sensitive?' Well, I think its because he hadtoo much sunlight while he was at the rooftop.<br1>
