The swordsmanship that I teach can only be learned bythe grace and delicacy of an Elven Fighter.<br1>
It is not suited to Humans,with their stiff shoulders.<br1>
Of course, it goes without saying thatMystics, who lack even the most basic sword techniques, will find it toodifficult.<br1>
Go find a teacher that is appropriate for you.<br1>
