In Innadril there are more worshippers of Eva than ofEinhasad.<br1>
Accordingly, the temple of Eva is the much more magnificent ofthe two.<br1>
Eva's followers in Innadril seem to have a slightly differntview or their goddess than is widely accepted.<br1>
This is no doubt due tothe influence of the indigenous religions.<br1>
It can be quite a shock to anunaccustomed Elf.<br1>
The High Priest of the Einhasad Temple is in chargeof the class transfer of Clerics and all clan-related business.<br1>
I hopezhis isn't confusing you.<br1>
Oh, but the way, the most important thing : Iteach Elves Warriors.<br1>
