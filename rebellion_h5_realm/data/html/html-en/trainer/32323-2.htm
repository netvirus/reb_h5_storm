<font color="FF8000">Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:</font><br>
To learn the magic of transformation,you will need to receive special training.<br1>
Find the Wizard of Darkness,who lives at Hardin's Academy.<br1>
He will open the path to transformation.<br1>
You must have reached at least *level 50* to embark on this path.<br1>
Youwill also need a special seal.<br1>
I do not know how you can obtain it, butwithout it transformation is impossible.<br1>
