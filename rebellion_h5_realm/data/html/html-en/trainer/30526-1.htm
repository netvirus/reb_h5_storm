Always happy to boast about our guild! While the otherraces were still throwing bamboo spears and swinging stone axes, ourancestors had mastered bronze tools and begun crafting steel weapons.<br1>
Only the best craftsmen are allowed entry into the Black Anvil Guild.<br1>
We, in turn, have fashioned mithril weapons and adamantite armor worn bykings and princes.<br1>
But beyond that, we have been researching the ancientdevices of the Giants.<br1>
Our fearsome Siege Golems and revoluntionaryairships are the results of those studies.<br1>
