I have nothing to teach you.<br1>
Maybe you'll find whoyou're looking for upstairs? Even though Gauen is younger than otherElves, he is a fine teacher.<br1>
Kaiena is quite hard to deal with but is agreat Mystic.<br1>
This place has no teachings for Clerics so, if you areone, I suggest you look for the temple.<br1>
