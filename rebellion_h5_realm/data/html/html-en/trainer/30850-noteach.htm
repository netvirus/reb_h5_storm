Regretfully, I only teach Human warriors.<br1>
All masters mustteach only those of their own race.<br1>
I wouldn't mind helping you if justhave a personal request, but it would behoove you to find anothermaster.<br1>
Here in this mighty capital of the kingdom of Aden, surely youwill find a suitable teacher.<br1>
