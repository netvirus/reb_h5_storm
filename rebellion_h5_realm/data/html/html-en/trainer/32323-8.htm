It is a tremendous endeavor to obtainsubclass certification and learn the appropriate skills.<br1>
Beyond thepurely physical effort, the burden on your soul is beyond yourimagination.<br1>
It is almost a suicidal venture.<br1>
However, the process canbe undone.<br1>
There is a special kind of herb that can be used to removeyour previously chosen skills.<br1>
The price of the herb, though, isapproximately *10 million adena*.<br1>
I have the herb here, so I cancancel the certification anytime once you have paid.<br1>
