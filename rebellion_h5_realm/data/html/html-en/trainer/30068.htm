<font color="0040FF">Priest Shegfield:</font><br>
Welcome to the Holy Temple of Einhasad.<br1>
Like PriestessGlyvka, I was born and raised here in Dion Castle Town.<br1>
At one time, Ithought this land was cursed.<br1>
The places outside of the castle andvillage are all very frightful, you see.<br1>
However, I gave my devotion toEinhasad and afterwards my mind was at peace.<br1>
Now I think this all wasthe will of the gods.<br1>
