Drat! Failed again! Oh, did you need to see me? Ha!Don't hold back your laughter! I was experimenting with magic to make mybody flexible, but as you see.<br1>
I've become petrified! An unfortunateside effect! Hmm, but it seems I partially succeeded! Look! My mouth isquite flexible, isn't it? Ha! Do you want to try this magic? Youshouldn't worry about the side effects too much.<br1>
The stiffness goesaway eventually, usually within a day.<br1>
