Well.<br1>
Mages are commonly described as cold figures,however in reality that is not true? Magic, at a glance, looks like aknowledge of controlling infinite power, and because of that Mages whocontrolled that power always feared it.<br1>
But, if once a Mystic becomesarrogant, one way or another, he will get tragic damages from it.<br1>
Wehave seen a few real examples, have we not? Mages are by no meanscoldhearted beings.<br1>
They are rather people with radical personalities,people who can sell their souls to the devil in order to achieve whatthey strive for.<br1>
Yes, without this personality it will be hard for oneto be a successful Mystic.<br1>
Me? Whew.<br1>
I'm not sure.<br1>
