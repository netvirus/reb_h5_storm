Did you know that the priests and priestesses met for apublic meeting recently at Oren Castle? The purpose was to gather thestrength of the five races and prepare for the coming era of chaos.<br1>
Atthe public meeting, it was decided that we Humans would do our best torestore the trust between the races and we sent messengers to variousplaces.<br1>
It looks like many priests and priestesses with deep devotionand bravery will be necessary for that role.<br1>
