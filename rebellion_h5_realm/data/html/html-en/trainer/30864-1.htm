The king of this country had no idea what washappening deep within his own land because he spent his time lookingoutside the kingdom.<br1>
Rivals in every place maintain their gaze on takingthis castle.<br1>
Elves scrunch up their eyes and say all kinds of thingabout the times.<br1>
But us Dark Elves don't criticize at all.<br1>
Humans aremore fun.<br1>
They talk like Elves but act like us Dark Elves.<br1>
Anyway, theyare a cute race that are different on the inside and outside.<br1>
