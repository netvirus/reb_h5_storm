Recently the streets have been swaming withdoomsayers, most babbling something about the return of Shillen.<br1>
Iwouldn*t be surprised to find that renegade forces within the templewere behind all this.<br1>
Although all Dark Elves have at the least a deeprespect for Shillen, these false prophets are most assuredly notendoresed by the elders.<br1>
They are just rabble-rousers who need to betaught a lesson.<br1>
I must admit that my weapons skill is lacking, but Ido have some other skills you might find interesting.<br1>
