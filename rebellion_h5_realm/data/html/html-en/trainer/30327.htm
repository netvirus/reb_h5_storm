<font color="0040FF">Master Sorius:</font><br>
As elegant as a swan upon the pond and as free as thebutterfly on a spring day.<br1>
Doesn't that sound like a bit of poetry?However, we who walk the path of a Fighter must keep those words etchedon our hearts.<br1>
A Fighter does not always rely on strength alone.<br1>
Themore skilled the warrior, the more he needs judgment to grasp theopponent's weak spot in an instant, while keeping his body composed andhis mind alert.<br1>
