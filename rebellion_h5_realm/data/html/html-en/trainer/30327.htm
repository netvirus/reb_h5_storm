<font color="FFFF00">Master Sorius:</font><br>
As elegant as a swan upon the pond and as free as the butterfly on a spring day.<br1>
Doesn't that sound like a bit of poetry?<br1>
However, we who walk the path of a Fighter must keep those words etched on our hearts.<br1>
A Fighter does not always rely on strength alone. The more skilled the warrior, the more he needs judgment to grasp the  opponent's weak spot in an instant, while keeping his body composed and  his mind alert.<br>
