Ha, you must be crazy! You don't know the differencebetween an Elf and a Dark Elf, or a Human and an Orc! I'll bet you don'teven know the difference between a Fighter and a Mystic! Do you know howto read? Or can you see the word 'Magister' written right here? Why areyou bothering me? I already have so many problems, I mean, my Masterwhines about a bad dream he had, golems rampaging about, eye ballsflying around, the Sea of Spores is expanding every day, Mitraell islocked up somewhere, I am terribly overworked, and now the sun isshining in my eyes and some weird fellow comes up and asks 'Will youteach me magic?' Please leave me alone! By the way, if you are a cleric,you are definately in the wrong place.<br1>
