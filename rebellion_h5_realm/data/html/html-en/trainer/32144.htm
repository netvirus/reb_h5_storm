Like most of our kind, you may also think that we Kamaelare the best fighters in the world, perhaps in part because only weteach different combat skills and styles based on gender.<br1>
But is thisprejudice on our part truly justified? Now that the Isle of Souls hasbeen opened, you should carefully observe the differences, strengths andadvantages of the other races.<br1>
Do you not see the wisdom of my words?Learn from the hunting skills and lifestyles of the other races andperhaps you will find a great benefit.<br1>
