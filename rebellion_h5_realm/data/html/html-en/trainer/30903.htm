Elves have lived in Innadril since ancient days.<br1>
Sincearound DE.<br1>
1200, when Tetrach Terestien and his followers came here fromOren, they have been known as the fairies of the lake.<br1>
In those days,Humans and Elves intermarried freely.<br1>
Elves blood flows through theveins of many residents of Innadril and therefore, the Humans in thisarea tend to live longer and be more attractive than elsewhere.<br1>
