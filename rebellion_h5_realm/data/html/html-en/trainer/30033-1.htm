<font color="FFFF00">Sorcerer Baulro:</font><br>
The Priest Yohanes is my elder twin brother.<br1>
Originally, we both promised to follow the path of a Priest like our father, who was a bishop, but I was fascinated by magic and chose to walk the path of the Sorcerer instead.<br1>
In the days when I wavered between the Sorcerer's life and the Priest's, my brother Yohanes encouraged me to choose the path I truly desired.<br1>
He helped me become the person I am now.<br1>
For that, I am very grateful to him.<br>
