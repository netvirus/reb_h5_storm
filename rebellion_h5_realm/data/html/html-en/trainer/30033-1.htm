<font color="0040FF">Sorcerer Baulro:</font><br>
The Priest Yohanes is my elder twin brother.<br1>
Originally, we both promised to follow the path of a Priest like ourfather, who was a bishop, but I was fascinated by magic and chose towalk the path of the Sorcerer instead.<br1>
In the days when I waveredbetween the Sorcerer's life and the Priest's, my brother Yohanesencouraged me to choose the path I truly desired.<br1>
He helped me becomethe person I am now.<br1>
For that, I am very grateful to him.<br1>
