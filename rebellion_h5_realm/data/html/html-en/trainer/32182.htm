Do you know the legend about the ancient heroes who savedthe Isle of Souls from destruction against a powerful invader? ThisHills of Gold was the site of a hard-fought battle where one of thoseheroes gained victory with the help of a golden shield that defended himagainst enemy attack.<br1>
Perhaps it is only a legend, but I feel thepresence of that legendary hero when I meditate here.<br1>
I cannot explainit, but it is as though I can tap into his spirit, filling me withpower.<br1>
