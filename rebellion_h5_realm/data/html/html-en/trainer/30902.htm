Welcome! If you want to learn how to kill Humans you areat the right place! Cut off their heads,beat them to death; there are amillion ways to do it and wherever you go it's always the same! Even inlovely-sounding places such as this, the city of the goddess ofwater.<br1>
Everyone in on their best behavior here, but step outside thegates even an inch and POW! Off comes your head! Or you get a knifestuck through you neck! Dark Elves are aware of these dangers.<br1>
Itneverceases to amaze me how different the children of the same goddessare from each other.<br1>
