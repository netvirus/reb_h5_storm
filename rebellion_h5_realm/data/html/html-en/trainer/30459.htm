The Fighters Guild here in the town of Dion is verystrict.<br1>
This may be because of the surrounding regions.<br1>
To the northlies the Cruma Marshlands and the Horseshoe Mountains.<br1>
To the east arethe Execution Grounds, dyed with the blood of Humans.<br1>
If you have theconfidence to endure the strict training, you may be up to thechallenge.<br1>
It is a natural law that things which are obtained withdifficulty are not easily lost.<br1>
