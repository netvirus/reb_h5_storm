Have you heard the story of Devil's Isle? It is said thatthe ghost of the great pirate Zaken haunts that forlorn island to thisvery day.<br1>
He foolishly sought immortality and got more than hebargained for.<br1>
Ha! All who have gone there in search of his lost treasurehave perished,may Einhasad have mercy on their souls.<br1>
This has causedgreat distress in our temple.<br1>
Oh, well, I'm sure from the look in youreyes that my warnings are falling on deaf ears.<br1>
You, like so manyothers, are called to that wicked place like moths to the flame! Heed mywords! A corpse shouldn't be prepared for burial at night.<br1>
Under thebright of Einhasad, all unclean things are burnt to ashes and blow away.<br1>
