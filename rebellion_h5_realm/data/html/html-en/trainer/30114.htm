Welcome to the Hall of Magic.<br1>
My fellow Sorcerers and Iare dispatched from the Ivory Tower to instruct seekers of wisdom herein Giran.<br1>
I see you are from a country school.<br1>
Perhaps you studied atEinhovant's School of Wizardry? I wonder if you really learned thebasics in such a remote place.<br1>
I'm a little worried that you may notbe able to keep up with my teaching.<br1>
Shall we begin? If there isanything you don't understand, don't feel embarrassed and always ask.<br1>
