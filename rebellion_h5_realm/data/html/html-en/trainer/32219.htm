Welcome! This village certainly seems like a quiet,peaceful place, does it not? Ah, but appearances can be deceiving, myfriend.<br1>
In reality, the different races feud behind the scenes withdeadly intensity.<br1>
There are even rumors of assassins for hire roamingthe streets.<br1>
I don't know whether that is true or not, but you shouldcertainly keep your wits about you while you are here.<br1>
