<font color="36DC25">Prefect Kasman:</font><br>
The low Orcs are the remnants of those tribes thatrevolted against our Kingdom's rule and became independent, only to beutterly defeated.<br1>
They detached themselves from the center of Orccivilization and created their own culture a long time ago.<br1>
But really,you can't call it a culture since they're uncivilized and barbarous.<br1>
I,Kasman, do not accept them as Orcs! It doesn't matter if we share thesame ancestors with them.<br1>
We should purify them with the power ofPaagrio.<br1>
