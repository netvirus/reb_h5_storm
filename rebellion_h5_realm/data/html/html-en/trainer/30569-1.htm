The Cave of Ordeal is also called the Cave of theFounder.<br1>
The cave is the tomb where our ancestors are buried, and alsothe sacred site where the founder was created.<br1>
In the beginning of theworld, great*Paagrio* shaped the spirit of the flame and created ourpowerful founder, who could even confront gods.<br1>
However, other gods wereafraid of the power of our founder and joined forces to kill him.<br1>
Godsput the everlasting flame to sleep by water, left the giants' bodiesscattered by the wind, and buried the remains with earth.<br1>
But with hislast breath, our founder told us to be strong.<br1>
We've lived up to ourfounder's will, trained ourselves through endless ordeals, and foughtfor thousands of years.<br1>
Our history is alive in the Cave of Ordeal.<br1>
