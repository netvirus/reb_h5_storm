<font color="36DC25">Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:</font><br>
You must remember that once you havetransformed, you must not go into *deep water*.<br1>
Once you have revertedto your original form, your soul will need time to recover -- you willnot be able to transform again for some time.<br1>
Understand? Other thanthat.<br1>
Each individual soul contains its own *unique chaiacter*.<br1>
If youtransform into something that matches that character, you may earn somebenefits.<br1>
Think of it as wearing a suit of clothes that fit youperfectly.<br1>
Every race has its own respective "figure," so I advise youto do a little research about what kind of transformation would fit youbest.<br1>
