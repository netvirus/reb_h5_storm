<font color="36DC25">Sorcerer Gauen:</font><br>
I am depressed by the things that are going on in thistower.<br1>
How can the things people strive for differ, if they walk thesame road.<br1>
The Grand Masters all say that chaos is eminent.<br1>
This chaoswill only be restored by cooperation between hostile races, I amcertain.<br1>
I do have good news, the purification process of the Sea ofSpores is being done by Human and Elves.<br1>
If things like this continue,trust will build and become a valuable treasure.<br1>
