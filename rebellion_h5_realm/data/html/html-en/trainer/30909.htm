Long ago, Elves and Humans lived peacefully together inInnadril.<br1>
But such was not the case in the Elven Forest, our hometown.<br1>
One Elf was imprisoned for almost 100 years as punishment for loving ahuman.<br1>
Even now, our elders are aghast at any mixing of the races.<br1>
Although they may have a point, there is no stopping love, is there? Iam no foolish youngster, yet thinking of this makes me sentimental.<br1>
