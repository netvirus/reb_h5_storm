<font color="36DC25">Master Auren:</font><br>
I am Auren, the head of the Kamael Guild here.<br1>
Always apleasure to meet someone like yourself.<br1>
Not to complain, but this placecan leave one feeling very lonely and isolated.<br1>
Have you met Duroga? Isuspect that his cold exterior is simply a mask to hide those feelingsof loneliness.<br1>
I feel sorry for him, although his attitude towards mehas been very disrespectful.<br1>
