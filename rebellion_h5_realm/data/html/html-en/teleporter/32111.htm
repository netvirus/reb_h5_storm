Welcome! I am Orahochin, proud warrior of the Elroki tribe! Iwas sent here to guard this place.<br1>
In truth, I guard the hope and futureof the tribe itself.<br1>
You don't understand? Ah, my young friend, I hopeyour feet are quicker than your wits! Ha ha! See the island over there?There you will find a village of innocent, peaceful Elroki natives.<br1>
Theyare far different than the degraded Elrokhins you find here, that I canassure you.<br1>
To protect them, I will transport only those to the islandthat mean them no harm.<br1>
Ah.<br1>
You don't seem like the dangerous sort --I will teleport you to the island if you wish.<br1>
