Until recently, no one knew how to get to the thirdfloor of this tower.<br1>
But now we can go there.<br1>
The transport device ofthe giants at the Ivory Tower was successfully studied, and a way wasopened.<br1>
According to those who have explored there, there are manydangerous monsters on the third floor.<br1>
There is also a huge gate left bythe giants, but I am told that no one has been able to open it yet.<br1>
Some* special technique to open the door* is required, it is thought.<br1>
