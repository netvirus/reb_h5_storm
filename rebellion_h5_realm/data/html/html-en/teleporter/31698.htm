The Rune Township is very different from othervillages of Elmore.<br1>
For one thing, it is quite a bit larger than othervillages.<br1>
In fact, it's so huge that the structure of the village itselfis divided into upper and lower levels! Therefore, people within thevillage have access to other parts of the village through the gate oftime and space.<br1>
