There is a place at the western end of Aden, on theshores of the Sea of Gludio, where airships depart for Gracia.<br1>
It's awharf created through ancient Giant technology and the best Adenengineers.<br1>
Since it floats in mid-air, however, there's no way to gothere directly.<br1>
The only way is to teleport there directly.<br1>
A gatekeeperfrom Talking Island or Gludio Castle Village can send you there.<br1>
We aredesperate for help.<br1>
If you are willing, I can send you up to GludioAirship Wharf myself.<br1>
But because some items are consumed, I must chargeyou something.<br1>
I feel almost ashamed to ask.<br1>
I only hope you will see itas a donation to Gracia.<br1>
If you can't afford it, the Gatekeeper inGludio Castle Village or Talking Island can also send you there.<br1>
