<font color="#3498DB">These ruins were used in the past by the Elves as a laboratory to research magic.<br1>
These days, very dangerous monsters lurk  nearby, and so Sir Collin Windawood has sealed the entrance and forbidden the common folk from coming here.<br1>
However, we may teleport adventurers seeking training to just inside of the entrance.<br1>
Would you like to go inside the ruins?</font><br>
