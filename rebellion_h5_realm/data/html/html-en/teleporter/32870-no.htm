<font color="36DC25">Separated Soul:</font><br>
The Claw of Antharas barely touched my face, but my soulwas still ripped apart like this.<br1>
I can't gather the scattered souls inthe area, but I can sense them.<br1>
I could send you to the location of thesouls, but you don't look capable yet of combining my ripped soul.<br1>
