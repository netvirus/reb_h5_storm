Here in Gludio there is an *Airship Dock* for Airshipsheading to Gracia.<br1>
Gracia is surrounded by a powerful magic force field,so it's impossible to enter it via teleportation or by sea.<br1>
OnlyAirships made in Gracia are able to safely travel between the twocontinents.<br1>
A dock made from floating stones was constructed nearby; ittook years of work, believe me.<br1>
Boarding is conducted through the*Airship Controller*.<br1>
The only way to journey to the Gracia Continent isto use this dock.<br1>
If you wish, I can teleport you there now.<br1>
