<font color="36DC25">Gracia Survivor:</font><br>
Do you know of the continent of Gracia? It is locatedfar across the sea from Aden; its land is barren and its climate isrough.<br1>
Despite these challenges -- or perhaps because of them -- it wasthe home of a strong, hardy people.<br1>
But now all has changed.<br1>
StrangeSeeds appeared throughout the continent, spawning *Pagan Monsters* whowreaked havoc on the land.<br1>
Although we fought under the command of KingKeucereus, we were outmatched.<br1>
Gracia fell under the sway of that greatevil.<br1>
Fortunately, a few survivors were able to reach Aden and ask forhelp.<br1>
There your clan leaders promised to send assistance.<br1>
Since then,our soldiers have formed a combined force under the command of KingKeucereus, waiting for our chance to exact vengeance on those whodestroyed our homes.<br1>
A few of my comrades stayed behind in Aden toappeal to other adventurers for help.<br1>
