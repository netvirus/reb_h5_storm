<font color="36DC25">Gatekeeper Mozella:</font><br>
My name is Mozella.<br1>
I am one of the researchersdispatched from Oren's Ivory Tower to search for the secrets lost in theTower of the Giants.<br1>
We recently discovered what we think is a deviceused by the Giants in a bygone age to travel through space and time, andwe are trying to unlock its secrets.<br1>
Fortunately, this place wasuntouched by the outside world during the long years, so the mysteriesof the Giants have remained undisturbed until our arrival.<br1>
Unfortunately, however, the Tower is also inhabited by a number offrightful monsters.<br1>
If you wish to brave the dangers to explore thesemysterious ruins, however, I will open the door of space and time andadmit you to the Tower's interior.<br1>
