/font><br><font color="CCCCFF">The Airship Field is where Airships heading to and from *Gracia* dock.<br1>
<br1>A powerful magic force field prevents entry to Gracia from sea or via teleportation.<br1>
<br1>But Gracian-made Airships can travel safely through the force field.<br1>
<br1>It is still a dangerous journey, though! After several years of work, a wharf was constructed from magical stones capable of floating in mid-air.<br1>
<br1>You can board one of the Airships using an *Airship Controller*.<br1>
<br1>If you wish to visit Gracia, this is the only way.<br1>
<br1>I can teleport you to the wharf if you wish.<br1>
