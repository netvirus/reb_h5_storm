/font><br><font color="CCCCFF">The Ivory Tower is the foremost temple of all Mystics.<br1>
<br1>It has been well known as such ever since the age of Elmoreden.<br1>
<br1>I was born here, and graduated from Einhovant's School of Wizardry.<br1>
<br1>And now, I am working as a gatekeeper by the order of the Ivory Tower.<br1>
<br1>If you happen to go to the Ivory Tower later on, please give my best regards to Grand Magister Valerie.<br1>
<br1>She is my teacher and a wonderful, caring person.<br1>
