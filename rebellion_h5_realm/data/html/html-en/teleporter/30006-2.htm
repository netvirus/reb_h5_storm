<font color="F1C40F">Gatekeeper Roxxy:</font><br>
<font color="CCCCFF">The Ivory Tower is the foremost temple of all Mystics.<br1>
It has been well known as such ever since the age of Elmoreden.<br1>
I was born here, and graduated from Einhovant's School of Wizardry.<br1>
And now, I am working as a gatekeeper by the order of the Ivory Tower.<br1>
If you happen to go to the Ivory Tower later on, please give my best regards to Grand Magister Valerie.<br1>
She is my teacher and a wonderful, caring person.</font><br>
