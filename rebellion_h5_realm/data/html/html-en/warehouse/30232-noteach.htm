I will safeguard anyone's property.<br1>
If aunicorn was to walk in and ask me to keep his horn I would gladly addhim to the account book.<br1>
However, I will not teach skills merely formoney.<br1>
.<br1>
If I teach our secrets, we Dwarven Artisans will be out of ourjobs! We can learn from the foolish Elves, who taught magic to theHumans only to be stabbed in the back.<br1>
