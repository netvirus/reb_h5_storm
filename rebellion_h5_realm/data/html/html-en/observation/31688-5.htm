<font color="FF8000">Grand Olympiad Manager:</font><br>
These are the rules to the Grand Olympiad.<br1>
Olympiad games can be divided into two categories.<br1>
One is a game whereyou can compete without class distinction, and the other you competeonly against someone of the same class.<br1>
To become a hero through theGrand Olympiad, you must win the most games.<br1>
Winners and loosers aredetermined by how much damage the players directly inflicted upon theiropponent.<br1>
If damage was inflicted to the Summoner's Servitor, Maestro'sGolem or Hell Knight's Dark Panther, it does not have any influence onthe scores in the game.<br1>
If you win, you will take 1/3 of the looser'sOlympiad points.<br1>
Players are given a certain amount of points when theOlympiad period starts, and periodically more points later on.<br1>
Playersmust have at least 1 Olympiad point to participate in the games.<br1>
