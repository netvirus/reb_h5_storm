Perhaps you remember that in the past, Life Crystals were assignedgrades based on the strength of the monsters.<br1>
That was because a LifeCrystal resembles the core energy of a powerful monster, and sodifferent cores came from monsters of different strength.<br1>
However,recent research has discovered that the Life Crystal grades really onlyindicate differences in volume rather than fundamental differences intheir characteristics.<br1>
Therefore, the old grading system has beenabandoned, and the Crystals are now categorized according to the amountof energy contained.<br1>
Using this new system, the previous C-grade crystalhas 2 times as much value, the B-grade crystal has 4 times as much valueand th A-grade crystal has 10 times as much value.<br1>
If you currently holdLife Crystals with the old grades, please exchange them for new LifeCrystals with the new measures.<br1>
