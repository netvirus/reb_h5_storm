<font color="FF8000">Our "Iron Gate" guild has came up with an amazing stuff after months ofresearch. It's called "Wondrous Cubic". This item can make various typesof "Cube Fragments". However, this item can only be used once a day,which has made it somewhat difficult to collect the fragments. How aboutit? If you bring the cubic fragments to me, I will exchange them forvarious scrolls and items. If you don't have a Wondrous Cubic, go seeHelvetia in Giran village. She will tell you how to get it. Oh, and Iheard that valuable jewels sometimes fall from the Wondrous Cubicoccassionally Of course, these rumors are just that, for now. (TheWondrous Cubics can be used everyday from 6:00 am)</font><br>
