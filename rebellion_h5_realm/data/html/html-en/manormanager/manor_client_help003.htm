When a seed germinates inside a monster it becomes a crop.<br1>
The bestcrops are harvested from monsters of a level similar to the sower.<br1>
Bringyour harvested crops to me and you will be rewarded.<br1>
The lord usuallycompensates farmers with items, some much more valuable than the crops.<br1>
