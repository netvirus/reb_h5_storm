<font color="FF8000">The seeds can be classified into regular type and alternative type. If you plant a regular type seed, a monster will hide an item and give youa crop of equivalent value instead. When you plant alternative typeseed, you will receive a crop approximately half of the time or you willreceive an item approximately half of the time. The lord establishedthis system so that players can choose their preferred type of gameplayby selecting the type of seed to plant in a manor. There are four kindsof seed:</font><br>
coda, cobol, codran and coba.<br1>
Availability of each type isbased upon a character's level.<br1>
Coda is the seed most appropriate forfarmers whose levels are between level 10 and level 30, relatively lowlevels.<br1>
Cobol is the seed most appropriate for farmers whose levels fallbetween level 31 and level 48.<br1>
Codran is the seed most appropriate forhigh level farmers of level 49 and level 64.<br1>
Coba is the seed mostappropriate for high level farmers of level 65 or above.<br1>
Obviously,different seeds grow different crops.<br1>
Certain seeds work better withcertain monsters.<br1>
If a monster is weak, he will produce a disappointingcrop.<br1>
On the other hand, if he is too strong, the crop could be damagedas well.<br1>
One secret of a successful crop is to pick a monster withapproximately the same power as the sower.<br1>
Trying to sow a seed on anon-compliant monster can have disastrous consequences.<br1>
You may purchaseany seed at any time, but the lord reserves the right not to purchaseany crop at his discretion.<br1>
You should always check to make sure thatyour crop is currently in demand.<br1>
And.<br1>
you've got to keep it a secretfro the Lord.<br1>
I hear other castles buy crops.<br1>
as long as they can bealso purchased there.<br1>
If the Lord changes his mind, I'll have no otherchoice but to sell my crops to other castles.<br1>
Please keep it a secret.<br1>
