When our race lived deep underground to avoid thesunlight, Tetrarch Vellior performed various experiments with the lowcreatures called gremlins, which lived underground, and created a newspecies called imps.<br1>
This slave race was made by the power of blackmagic.<br1>
They have long, thin claws and the ability to sense the road inthe dark.<br1>
They also have wings that enable them to fly, to collectmushrooms and moss from cave walls or ceilings, or minerals from deepmines.<br1>
They honored our name and served us loyally for hundreds ofyears.<br1>
However, they somehow undid the spells of restraint, killingtheir overseers and escaping.<br1>
We were at war with the Elves of light atthe time, so we weren't able to do anything about it.<br1>
How they undid thespells of the Tetrarchs is yet unrevealed, but there are those whosuspect that some imps knew how to use magic.<br1>
It is hard for me tobelieve that such a primitive race could learn magic.<br1>
