I am Sentry Krispen.<br1>
What do you know? You can restsafely in this part near the village because we are protecting it.<br1>
Youdon't have to worry, since our bravery cannot be compared to thecowardly Elves.<br1>
I just wish there was some way to get rid of all the*imps* that wander around in our forest.<br1>
