The thing is, these craters around the Ivory Tower weremade by shooting stars a long time ago.<br1>
The Ivory Tower was created byMages who knew the mysterious power of extinguihed stars.<br1>
The ElmoradenEmpire was governed by Mages who harnessed the power of these stars, butas time passed the power ebbed and the influence of the Ivory Tower grewweaker.<br1>
Then, 50 years ago, a Great Wizard began experimenting with thepower of shooting stars.<br1>
However his work was incomplete, and the Mageshave yet to regain anything resembling their former power.<br1>
Consequently,many strange creatures have taken up residence around the tower.<br1>
