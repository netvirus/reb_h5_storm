If you follow this road west, you will come to a fork inthe road.<br1>
If you turn to the southwest, you will pass the AbandonedCamp.<br1>
Once, it was a camp for the Gracian armies, but it has beenabandoned for some time and is now the camp for the ol mahums.<br1>
Thosenasty ol mahums were hired by Gracia as mercenaries, but they wereunable to return to their country and were left here to plunder for aliving.<br1>
So you must be extra careful when you're traveling near there,or you may be ambushed by ol mahum looters.<br1>
