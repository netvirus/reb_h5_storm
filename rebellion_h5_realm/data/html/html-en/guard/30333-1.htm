If you follow this road west, you will come to a fork in the road. If you turn to the southwest, you will pass the Abandoned Camp.<br1>
Once, it was a camp for the Gracian armies, but it has been abandoned for some time and is now the camp for the ol mahums.<br1>
Those nasty ol mahums were hired by Gracia as mercenaries, but they were unable to return to their country and were left here to plunder for a living.<br1>
So you must be extra careful when you're traveling near there, or you may be ambushed by ol mahum looters.<br>
