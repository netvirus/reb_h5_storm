<font color="0040FF">Sentinel Starden:</font><br>
May the song of stars give you happiness.<br1>
I amStarden, one of the sentinels who protect the forest,the Mother TreeGlade, and Elves of light.<br1>
If my expression looks dark, then forgive me.<br1>
Originally, I was a cheerful elf who enjoyed poetry and singing, but nowI've lost all my former optimism since I went through the war.<br1>
I had tolook upon the sight of my friends being brutally killed by the DarkElves at the *final battle of the Underground Fortress* .<br1>
I try hardto forget the fear and sorrow of those times, but I still havenightmares once in a while.<br1>
