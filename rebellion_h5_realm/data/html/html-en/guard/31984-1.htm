According to legend, the Ice Queen's Castle was once abeautiful palace, built by seven Dwarven Maestros as a tribute to theElven Magician Preya.<br1>
But something dreadful happened to Preya, and shebecame the horrifying witch that we now call the Ice Queen.<br1>
Since thatday, the whole region has been covered in snow and ice! Her bitternessmust have caused it.<br1>
Still, I'm sure the Ice Castle is a wonder tobehold! You mustn't venture too far inside, however.<br1>
