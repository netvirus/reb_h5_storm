As the name suggests, the island is swarming withalligators! It is a popular tourist destination, where travelers go tosample the delicious meet or collect the valuable pelts of thesereptiles.<br1>
Besides alligators there are also beasts on the island called*crokians*.<br1>
Their apperance is similar to that of alligators, but theywalk on two legs and use their hands to wield weapons! They are relatedto lizardmen and consider alligators sacred.<br1>
These crokians make theisland a very dangerous place, even for the most experienced hunter.<br1>
Ifyou're going there, I heard that Grocer Enverun is currently looking forsomeone to go to the island on his behalf.<br1>
