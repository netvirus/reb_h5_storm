I used to travel around the kingdom as a mercenary.<br1>
Thereason I came to Talking Island was because I was escorting a ship.<br1>
Butthen I fell in love with the beauty of this island and put an end to myvagabond life.<br1>
Sunrise on the beach, the thick forest, and themagnificent *waterfalls.<br1>
* You can t find a more beautiful place inAden.<br1>
