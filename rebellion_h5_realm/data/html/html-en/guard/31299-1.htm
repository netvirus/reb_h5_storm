I've never been there myself, but I've heard that it's ahuge underground catacomb north of Argos Wall.<br1>
I don't know any more,except that many graverobbers have been seen there, drawn by rumors oftreasure and relics from the empire.<br1>
I seriously doubt if any imperialremnants remain there.<br1>
