Take a look around this forest.<br1>
It's full of keltirs andwolves, isn't it? It wasn't always like this! Before, owls and cuckoosmade their nests in every tree and bighorn deer leisurely grazed on thegrass.<br1>
You could see furry squirrels running around with fruit from thetrees clenched between their teeth.<br1>
However, it is becoming moredifficult to find those animals.<br1>
