It is risky to speak of such things, but I will trust youand tell you.<br1>
It is the Execution Grounds of a rebel army of farmers whorevolted against the lord's severe rule a few years ago.<br1>
At the time,the lord cruelly and publicly executed all those involved in the revolt,and their families, as an example to the people.<br1>
Those who were unjustlykilled became the undead, and they haunt the Execution Grounds to thisday.<br1>
