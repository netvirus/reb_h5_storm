It's just a country.<br1>
I mean, what more is there to say?Generally, they say that it is the Godard territory of Elmore.<br1>
There'salso a village called Godard Village and it seems to have become reallyimpoverished due to the war.<br1>
The citizens are starving.<br1>
But as theyare still planning to attack our Aden again and have put up hugecastles, I really feel bad for the people that live there.<br1>
Right afterthe war, our situation here in Aden was pretty bad too but thanks to thequick handling of His Royal Highness Amadeo, we've been able to recoverlike this.<br1>
When I think of him whose age is even younger than me, I canonly say that he's simply amazing.<br1>
