We're not talking about the birds that actually live inthe bushes.<br1>
These Magpie Brothers are not so cute.<br1>
Originally they wereof the Dwarven guild that specializes in searching ruins and collectingrelics but they were going around the graves of the ancient Dwarvenkings and stealing stuff.<br1>
And they were expelled from our tribe whenthis was discovered.<br1>
But they simply changed themselves into a new graverobbing guild and now they make no distinction of race when digging upthe places in which the past royalty are buried.<br1>
Of course, variousgraves at the National Cemetary have also been vandalized by them.<br1>
Idon't understand why the ghosts don't deal with those creatures.<br1>
