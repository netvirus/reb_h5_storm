<font color="FFFF00">Guard Moretti:</font><br>
Greetings!<br1>
You may think it is boring to stand guard here all day, but it is always enjoyable having a word or two with<br1>
travelers. Especially when I stand guard here at the west gate, I frequently meet the Elves from the *Elven Forest.* I m used to it now, but I was really fascinated the first time I saw an Elf...<br>
