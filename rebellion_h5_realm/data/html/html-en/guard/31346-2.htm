The *von Hellmanns* were aristocrats who ruled the manorin the eastern section of Rune.<br1>
They gained power after theirdistinguished service in the war with Aden.<br1>
But the revolt was theirundoing! They were all brutally massacred! Now the mere mention of theirname can be deadly.<br1>
Watch what you say around here! If you visit the*Forest of the Dead*, you should really be careful! Legend says that thevon Hellmann Family has all turned into *blood-drinking creatures*roaming about the forest.<br1>
