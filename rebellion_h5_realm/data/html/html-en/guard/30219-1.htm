In the age of great disaster, our goddess was filledwith sadness at seeing so many deaths.<br1>
They say her tears formed LakeIris.<br1>
A long time ago, just once, I saw the lake nymphs dancing on theripples as if they were gliding.<br1>
Now all the lake nymphs have left, butsometimes if you take a walk around Lake Iris you can hear the echoes oftheir singing.<br1>
