Kakai, the Paagrio Lord, is a great Orc.<br1>
It wasamazing to see him duel with Raoul, the King of Men a long time ago.<br1>
They were well-matched in combat.<br1>
Raoul was a great man, too.<br1>
He isresponsible for uniting Aden.<br1>
I can't believe such a great warrior diedlike that.<br1>
When Lord Kakai heard the news, he looked genuinely sad.<br1>
