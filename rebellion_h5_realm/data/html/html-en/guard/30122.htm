Greetings.<br1>
I am Blane, Guard of Giran Castle Town.<br1>
Ourvillage has loads of items that you cannot buy in other places.<br1>
Ifyou're lucky, you'll find a valuable item.<br1>
I once went to buy something,but my meager wages weren't quite enough to pay for it.<br1>
It was some kindof luxury shop or something.<br1>
If you have the chance, check it out,they have some great things.<br1>
