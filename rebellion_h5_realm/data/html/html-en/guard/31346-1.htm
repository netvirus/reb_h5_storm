Well, let's see.<br1>
.<br1>
My hometown is in ruins! And now,vicious beasts are trying to kill me every time I turn around.<br1>
You'dbe grumpy too! My hometown was a small, peaceful village in the manorruled by the von Hellmann family.<br1>
It was an humble village, inhabited byhunters and lumberjacks.<br1>
The people there were drawn into the revolt andkilled, including my entire family.<br1>
I'd prefer that the village hadburnt to the ground, but still it exists.<br1>
A wicked shell of its formerself, inhabited only by evil spirits and ghosts.<br1>
