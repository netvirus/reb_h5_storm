If you cross this bridge and travel along the roadsouthwest, you will pass the abandoned underground fortress and theNeutral Zone, and arrive at the place that the Humans call Gludio.<br1>
Gludio is the largest region in the Human Kingdom of Aden.<br1>
However, itwas attacked by another Human Kingdom called Gracia from overseas a fewyears ago, so parts of the region have burned down.<br1>
Since history began,Humans have always enjoyed cruel wars in this way.<br1>
The war has left manyruins in Gludio, which have become dangerous places haunted by theundead.<br1>
Also, huge insects lurk in the vast wastelands in the south.<br1>
