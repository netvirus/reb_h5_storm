Greetings.<br1>
Have you seen many places? My wish is toadventure in the wide, outside world someday.<br1>
When I give up my job assentry, I am thinking of traveling to Elmore.<br1>
If you go there, there isthe village of *Pabell* built by Dark Elves.<br1>
Maybe it's just because ofthe oppressive atmosphere that hangs around the *School of Dark Arts*,but sometimes my wish seems a very remote possibility.<br1>
