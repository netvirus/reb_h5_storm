The town of Gludio is a place where you can observevarious cultures, since many races gather there.<br1>
It is a very good placeto extend your knowledge of the Human world.<br1>
However, it is filled withlarge and unshapely buildings, so it is stifling.<br1>
It is difficult tofind your way around there, so if you go, you should make sure to learnwhere the guild and shops are first.<br1>
