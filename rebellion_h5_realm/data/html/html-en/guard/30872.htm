Have you been to Narsell Lake to the south of thevillage? In the past, you could rent a boat at the pier and go for aride or fish from the side of the river.<br1>
It was very nice.<br1>
But becauseof the war, all the recreational facilities on the lake were closed.<br1>
Um,there are those who say that recently they saw His Royal Highness Amadeoriding in a boat there with Sir Castella.<br1>
Could this be a sign that wewill soon be able to enjoy fishing and boat riding in the lake likebefore? If so, that would be great.<br1>
