Having the capital city so close to the border like thiskind of makes me uncomfortable.<br1>
We're currently under a ceasefire butif Elmore were to attack, the border forces would not be able to put upany resistance at all.<br1>
There was some talk about opening the border butsomething happened so that the border restrictions have started to beenforced even more than before.<br1>
I sure hope that nothing happens tostart the war all over again.<br1>
