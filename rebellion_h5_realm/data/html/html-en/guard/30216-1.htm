In the beginning, Einhasad created the Elves, and theunion of the world's oldest tree and the first Elf became the MotherTree.<br1>
All the Elves afterwards were born from the leaves of the MotherTree Glade.<br1>
Perhaps that is why, when we rest under the shade of theMother Tree Glade, our bodies and souls all feel at ease.<br1>
When we aretired and weary, there is nothing better than resting under the shade ofthe Mother Tree Glade.<br1>
