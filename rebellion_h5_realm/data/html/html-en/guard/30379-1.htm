Gracia is a kingdom across the west sea.<br1>
All tradewith Gracia has been interrupted since the war, but there was a timewhen scores of Gracian trading ships would frequent this harbor everyday.<br1>
The Gracians were our friends, and no one imagined they couldbecome such bloodthirsty demons in such a short time.<br1>
When all is saidand done, you cannot judge a person on outward manner alone.<br1>
