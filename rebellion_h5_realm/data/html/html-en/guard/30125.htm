Do you see the great mountain range to the north? Therange forms two lines to the east and west, but we call it the DragonValley.<br1>
It's called that because they say the*green dragon Antharas*nests at the end of the range.<br1>
Well .<br1>
it's such a dangerous place thatI don't know if I'd advise you to go there.<br1>
