No, it's nothing special.<br1>
It's just the useless chatterof crazy fanatics.<br1>
It has been said that, a long time ago, when Shilencaused a war against Einhasad and lost, for some reason, the gods didn'tkill Shilen but rather sealed her into the location that we are speakingof now.<br1>
The book called the Scriptures of the Seal lists seven methodsof releasing the seal of Shilen.<br1>
And this is not just the seven ghoststories that are spoken of by children in school.<br1>
Ah, if the depravedgod is resurrected, the people living in the land will all die so do youreally think that the sealing would have been done so carelessly?Obviously, this is just the useless talk of a crazy person.<br1>
And if it isso easy to resurrect, the depraved goddess would have alreadyresurrected in the distant past.<br1>
