I only know what I've heard.<br1>
Abnormal weather hasbeen a problem recently, and the harbors in the northern part of Kingdomof Elmore are frozen.<br1>
This could be the beginning of the everlastingwinter, a prophecy handed down among Orcs from ancient times.<br1>
When theeverlasting winter comes, all lands will be frozen, and all races willbe wiped out.<br1>
Then, Lord Paagrio will come down and save the world, itis said.<br1>
