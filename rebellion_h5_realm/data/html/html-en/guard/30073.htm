How do you do, honored traveler? Have you come to ourvillage to see the great shell of *cruma*? If you have, then you'd bewell advised to give up your search.<br1>
Many have come to this village toview the shell of cruma, but I have rarely seen anyone return from thatplace intact.<br1>
The *Marshlands* where the shell of cruma lies have forages been a place teeming with monsters -- even our guards don't like togo near there.<br1>
