It is a vast forest to the northeast in Oren and is theheadquarters of the Dark Elves.<br1>
They have a deep-rooted feud against theElves of light, and so the two enemies have come to blows on occasion,but now they have signed a peace agreement.<br1>
I shudder when I look at theDark Elves, with their ash-colored skin and dark eyes, but I also feel astrange fascination.<br1>
They say there is a guild building where Dark Elvesgather, somewhere in this village .<br1>
