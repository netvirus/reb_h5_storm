The Enchanted Valley looks close on the map but isactually quite far.<br1>
The entrances are located at the north and south,but the entrances are quite far from our town.<br1>
Hunters who set up campson the south eventually made their camps into a village.<br1>

Well, do you know about Fairies? Small Elf-like creatures withsmall wings on their backs.<br1>
Anyway, in the past, they were exiled byHumans, and today they curse the Men living in the valley.<br1>
That is whyit is a dangerous place especially for Humans.<br1>
If you want to know moreyou should go ask at the Hunters' Village.<br1>
