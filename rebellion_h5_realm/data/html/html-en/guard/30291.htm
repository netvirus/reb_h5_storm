Hello, young friend.<br1>
I am Alex, the militia leader of FloranVillage.<br1>
This is a village of poor farmers, who sought escape from theLord's tyranny and, subsequently, does not have organized protectionwith proper guards.<br1>
I formed the militia as I could not see the farmersfighting adequately against thieves and have other races plunder themhelplessly.<br1>
