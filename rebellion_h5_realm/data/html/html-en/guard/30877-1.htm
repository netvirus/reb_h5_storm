Is that a fact? OK then, wait a moment.<br1>
First I need torecord your belongings and appearance.<br1>
And what's your name? .<br1>
? .<br1>
What kind of a name is that? Alright, fine.<br1>
If you're really planning togo to the Shilen Holy Place, then there are some things I need to notifyyou about.<br1>
You might already know about this but that place is where thedepraved god Shilen gave birth to six dragons and then changed them intodeath goddesses.<br1>
According to the legend, the army of light defeated thedepraved god but was not able to kill the goddesses that control theworld of darkness and so they are sealed in that place.<br1>
Therefore, thereare a lot of religious researchers, clergymen and fanatics gatheredthere.<br1>
And there are strange ones that want to kill not just the DarkElves that serve Shilen but also those that serve the god of light, aswell as other gods, which they regard as being cults.<br1>
The crazy onesthat fight saying they will release the seal of Shilen have plenty todo.<br1>
And there are many watchers sent by the religious bodies in orderto stop all those blasphemous ones.<br1>
These watchers are in utterdissolutionment because of the depravity of this age.<br1>
Therefore, I'mentreating you that if you go there, please avoid any actions whichcould have any chance of being misunderstood.<br1>
I mean, regardless ofwhether they are fanatics of Shilen or watchers of the seal.<br1>
