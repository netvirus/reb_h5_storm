Be careful! This place is very crowded because ofconstruction on the village wall.<br1>
Wooden props may collapse or bricksmay fall, so be on alert.<br1>
Many are experiencing discomfort due to theconstruction.<br1>
In particular, the Traders from *Giran* have manycomplaints.<br1>
I hope the construction is finished quickly so that thetravelers can enter the village through a proper gate.<br1>
