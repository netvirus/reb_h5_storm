<br> What do you know about Gludio Castle? It is the official	residence of the lord of Gludio, of course.<br1>
<br> But it was originally built by wise King Cadmus to deter an	invasion from Gracia.<br1>
<br> When Gracia finally did invade a few years ago, the Gludio	garrison was safe and secure in the castle, and our troops were able to	repel the invaders.<br1>
All thanks to the king's foresight!	<br>	<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_TerritoryStatus">Ask about the		local lord and tax rate.<br1>
