Originally, it was a camp set up by the troops of Gracia.<br1>
It was abandoned for some time after Gracia lost the war and withdrewtheir troops.<br1>
However, now ol mahum's band has made their camp there.<br1>
The ol mahums were mercenaries employed by Gracia, but after the warthey were unable to return to their country, and they remain here livingas bandits.<br1>
They are such scoundrels! I think the Gracian army abandonedthem, if you want my opinion.<br1>
