The village is right in front of the massive GludioCastle, where the lord lives.<br1>
It was made by the king's command when thecastle was built, so it does not have a very long history.<br1>
It is evensmaller than the town of Gludio.<br1>
However, it is next to the Dion regionand is close to the Elven Forest, so many travelers pass through it.<br1>
Ifyou want to go there, follow this road northwest.<br1>
On your way there, youwill pass the camp of ol mahums and the ruins of the undead, so it mightbe a dangerous journey .<br1>
