When the war broke out, the people who were unable toescape to Gludio Castle all flocked to the village of Bernice.<br1>
Theythought they could withstand the attack of the invaders because thevillage had a stone outer wall.<br1>
The lord's men, who suffered retreatafter retreat, positioned themselves using the village as a stronghold.<br1>
Einhasad's priests who were healing the wounded also stayed at thevillage.<br1>
The troops fought off the attack of the Gracian army a fewtimes, and began to hope that the villagers would live.<br1>
However, it wasof no use.<br1>
The Gracian army had joined forces with the foreign troops ofol mahum.<br1>
Those violent degenerates broke the outer wall and swarmedinto the village, slaughtering soldiers, priests, farmers and anyoneelse in sight.<br1>
They also set all the buildings on fire.<br1>
In just onenight, the village of Bernice was devastated.<br1>
Its murdered people couldnot rest and rose again as the undead, filled with hatred.<br1>
