It is said that long ago a meteorite fell to earth rightwhere the Ivory Tower stands today.<br1>
The tower was built there to utilizethe great magical power left over from that collision.<br1>
Because of thepower of this place, monsters have become something of a problem.<br1>
Recently they have been dropping *High-level Spellbooks* occasionally.<br1>
Until now the knowledge of these books has been quite rare.<br1>
