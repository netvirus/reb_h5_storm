If you go south of here, there is a very large swamp.<br1>
They say that it was created as a side effect of the black magic used inthe war with the Elves.<br1>
Unpleasant monsters live there.<br1>
If you go alittle farther down from there, you will come to the Neutral Zone, whichwas created by an agreement with the Elves.<br1>
If you go east from there,you will come to the Elven Forest where the arrogant Elves live.<br1>
Theyare a race that thinks they are the most noble in the world.<br1>
