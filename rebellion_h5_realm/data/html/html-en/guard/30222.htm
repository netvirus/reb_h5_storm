<br> Greetings, I am Alshupes, a moneylender.<br1>
My Elven brothers	may criticize me for lending money, but I don't care.<br1>
They say they're	ashamed of me as an Elf or something .<br1>
Who says they're not right?	But in times like these, don't they know that one needs money above	anything, even if one is an Elf? Don't you think so?	<br> Oh, and by the way, don't think about borrowing money from	me.<br1>
These days I'm thinking of a	<font color="LEVEL"> new business </font> so I'm putting a hold on	money lending.<br1>
I should go pursue sales in a Human village or something	.<br1>
