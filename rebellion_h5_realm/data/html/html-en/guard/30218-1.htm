This forest may seem peaceful at first glance, butterrible enemies lurk within.<br1>
For hundreds of years, our kingdom wasunder attack by the Orcs of the Misty Mountains, the fungus from the Seaof Spores, and the giant spiders from the Wasteland of Gludio.<br1>
When youtravel in the forest, you must not forget for one moment the threatsthat hide behind the lovely scenery.<br1>
