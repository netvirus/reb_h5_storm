No kidding! I'll tell ya, this place really lives up toits name! Do you know about the uprising in Rune? They executed therebels here! This place has been accursed ever since! They say theghosts here have a taste for flesh! This is the only way to Rune, butnobody will travel this way after dark! It even creeps me out during theday! I wouldn't go down there at night if I were you!<br1>
