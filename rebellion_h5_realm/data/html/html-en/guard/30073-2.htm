The marshlands are where the cruma's shell is, so they arecalled the the Cruma Marshlands.<br1>
The Marshlands are beyond that templeover there.<br1>
If you keep walking north, you can easily find them.<br1>
However, there are rarely people there and the place is swarming withfrightening monsters.<br1>
I think it is rash to go there alone.<br1>
I've warnedyou in no uncertain terms.<br1>
Please don't reproach me for the consequencesif you choose to disregard my advice.<br1>
