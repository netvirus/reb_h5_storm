Are you a traveler? This is not the kindof place you want to be visiting as a tourist.<br1>
Sorry, but I'm going toneed to check your baggage.<br1>
.<br1>
Hmm, there's nothing here that'sparticularly suspicious.<br1>
If you follow the road to the south a shortway, you'll come to Aden Castle and Aden Castle Town.<br1>
I recommend thatyou stay there tonight.<br1>
You can't cross the border now.<br1>
In the past,only people with a transit certificate could go back and forth but asfar as I know, the issuance of such certificates has been suspended.<br1>
