Well, the hunters around here aren't as occupied withtrapping and hunting and selling skins as hunters from other places.<br1>
Ofcourse they do those jobs, but here the hunters are stronger, wiser andmore organized.<br1>
They know the forests as well as the Elves.<br1>
Our huntershave served as mercenaries for many Lords.<br1>
These hunters also have astrong sense of freedom and independence and refuse to be dominated byanyone.<br1>
