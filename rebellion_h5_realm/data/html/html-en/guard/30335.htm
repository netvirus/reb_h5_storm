Have you been to the southern parts of Gludio by anychance? My cousin used to work as a mercenary soldier, but heexaggerated so much, I couldn t really believe much that he told me.<br1>
What was it that he said? It was something about a large cave in theWastelands of southern Gludio and giant ants that ate people.<br1>
Can youbelieve such a tall tale? Hah! That rascal, he would have been a greatersuccess if he'd become a storyteller.<br1>
