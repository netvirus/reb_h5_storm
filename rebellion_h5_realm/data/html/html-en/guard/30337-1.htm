If you cross this bridge and follow the road, you canreach the Elven Forest.<br1>
I have never been there myself, but according tothe Elves that come here it is a very beautiful place.<br1>
Until justrecently, the Elves had erected a magic force around their forest sothat no one could enter, but now anyone can enter the forest.<br1>
If you getto go there, please come back someday and tell me all about it.<br1>
