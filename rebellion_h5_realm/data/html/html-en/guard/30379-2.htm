<font color="FF8000">Captain Bezique:</font><br>
The Gracian invasion force crossed the sea andattacked our kingdom not long after his majesty had ascended the throne.<br1>
Many innocents lost their lives in the savage attack.<br1>
Fortunately, ourwise king negotiated an alliance with Elmore, and we were able to driveback those Gracian wretches.<br1>
In the end, we were victorious, but thepeople of Gludio paid far too high a price.<br1>
All I wish is that a warlike that never happens again.<br1>
