The Sea of Spores? Please don't mention that name! Evennow it makes me uncomfortable.<br1>
It is a foul place, glutted with rottenmushrooms, fungus and zombies roaming about.<br1>
Honestly, you will not findanother place like it.<br1>
A war between Men and Elves a long time ago leftthe sea into its current state.<br1>
Towers were erected to stop peoplefrom entering, to keep monsters from coming out of the sea and to stemthe sea's expansion.<br1>
You can see why it will be difficult to travel toand from the sea.<br1>
I have it on very good authority that the inner sealooks vastly different that the outer sea.<br1>
The place is currently sodangerous that even Magisters dare not go there.<br1>
If you must go, I willtell you the way.<br1>
Cross the river west of the Ivory Tower and continuewestward.<br1>
Follow the cliff south and you will see 4 towers.<br1>
Those arethe protection towers.<br1>
You probably have a good idea of what to donext.<br1>
