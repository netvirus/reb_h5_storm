The Plunderous Plains are as dreary as they sound! an oldrailroad crosses them, and goes all the way to Schuttgart Castle.<br1>
There's a Strip Mine in the east that was abandoned by the Dwarves, andan old harbor in the south.<br1>
When traveling there you must beware of thegangs of bandits and Kobolds.<br1>
I must get back to work now.<br1>
Goodbye.<br1>
