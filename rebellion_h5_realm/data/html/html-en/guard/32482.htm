<br> Halt! Welcome to the Town of Oren.<br1>
Even in our fair city,	there are several dangerous areas -- for your safety, ask before you	venture blindly into a hazardous situation.<br1>
There isn't anything	dangerous to the west, fortunately.<br1>
The Elven Forest, home to all the	Elves, lies not too far away.<br1>
<br> I hear it's beautiful.<br1>
I'd even like to visit it sometime.<br1>
However, the Dragon Claw Mountains lie between Oren and the Elven	Forest, so even though the distance isn't great, traveling there isn't	easy.<br1>
