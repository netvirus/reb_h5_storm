Wow! I knew you were from the south, but I didn't realizehow ignorant you were! The Varka are the most powerful tribe among theSilenos! During the war with Aden, our late king hired them asmercenaries.<br1>
Unfortunately, after the war they settled down in thisregion.<br1>
You have Silenos in the south too, right? Well, don't bemistaken.<br1>
The Varka are a different breed all together! They areformidable beasts that are at least equal to the Ketra Orcs in ferocity.<br1>
