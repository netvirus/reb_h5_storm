The Ivory Tower has stood here for nigh on a thousandyears.<br1>
It has become quite popular as a place for elites to study themagical arts.<br1>
There are gates at the north and south of the tower.<br1>
Weguard the tower and its surroundings from a host of threats.<br1>
The towerhas many floors, but guests can only go up to the 4th.<br1>
If you want toknow what is on each floor, ask that friendly person over there.<br1>
Or youcan just wander around.<br1>
Oh, and just so you know, the Ivory Tower isstrictly neutral territory.<br1>
So please, don't say or do anything thatcould cause trouble.<br1>
