The harbor was originally made to allow contact betweenthe Isle of Souls and the mainland.<br1>
Initially, there were many goodsthat flowed through here, but no ships come here now.<br1>
It is better, yousee, for the adventurers who come here to use the gatekeeper's side.<br1>
Ifyou go there, I'm sure you will find a gatekeeper preparing to go to themainland.<br1>
