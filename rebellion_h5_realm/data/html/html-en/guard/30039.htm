Nice to meet you, young friend.<br1>
I am Captain Gilbert.<br1>
Our guards maintain the peace in the village and work day and night toprotect the residents from ferocious beasts or orcs, just like the*lighthouse* works constantly to protect ships from the rocks.<br1>
If youare planning to leave the village, ask the guards about getting aroundon the island.<br1>
We wouldn't want you to suffer misfortune, lost in aforest full of orcs and wolves.<br1>
