Aren't you a suspicious fellow! Why are you here?Where are you from? You have a peculiar accent.<br1>
Could it be that you area spy from Elmore? We have had a lot of trouble with foreigners lately,especially ones from Rune and Lansk.<br1>
Recently some spies from Rune wereposing as brigands in this area, causing a lot of havoc.<br1>
You wouldn'tbe one of them, would you? Well, you don't look like them.<br1>
