The swamp to the north of Aden Castle is called theBlazing Swamp.<br1>
The name makes one think of some hellish sea of fire thatis covered in molten rock or something.<br1>
But looking at it from theoutside, it really doesn't seem much different than any other marsh.<br1>
However, the monsters that come out of it are a bit peculiar.<br1>
Paagriodid something there.<br1>
And so they are all masters of the fire line ofmagic.<br1>
King Raoul gave the order that a waterway be dug at the edge ofthe marsh to prevent the spreading of fires to the area around.<br1>
But themost famous thing about the Blazing Swamp happened when King Amadeo wasattacked by Elmore.<br1>
Oh, right.<br1>
It wouldn't be good for you to knowabout this long-winded story.<br1>
