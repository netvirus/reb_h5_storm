<font color="0040FF">Sentinel Rayen:</font><br>
May the wind of the forest lead you to peace.<br1>
I am thesentinel Rayen.<br1>
Our duty is to drive away those who try to attack ourforest and village.<br1>
The Elven Forest is no doubt our home.<br1>
However, wehave lived in the seclusion of this forest too long and I believe thatliving our lives isolated from the outside world has made us weak.<br1>
Iadvise Elves who have learned the basics of sword and spell to go outbeyond the forest into the land of Humans and extend their knowledge.<br1>
The first gateway would be *Gludio*, located to the south of the ElvenForest.<br1>
