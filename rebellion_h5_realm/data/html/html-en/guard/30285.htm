<font color="FF8000">Sentinel Gartrandell:</font><br>
May the blessing of the starlight fall upon you.<br1>
My name is Gartrandell, one of the sentinels who guard the forest andthe Mother Tree Glade.<br1>
I left the forefront because I was injured in thewar with the Dark Elves, and now I guard the *Sanctum of Eva.<br1>
* TheSanctum of Eva is home to splendid Elven cultural relics, so I am proudof my job.<br1>
I am also pleased that I can stay a little closer to mysweetheart.<br1>
