<font color="0040FF">Guard Jerin:</font><br>
Eh, nice weather, eh stranger? I've been a guard for along time but, honestly, I've never even gotten a scratch in the line ofduty.<br1>
I am lucky.<br1>
Really, even though you're a skilled adventurer,you'll never be able to beat someone who's lucky.<br1>
One of my friends.<br1>
He was so drunk one time, he didn't even have his armor on, went andwandered off by the *protection towers,*, near the *Sea of Spores* totake a leak, and didn't even see a monster.<br1>
Lucky bastard.<br1>
