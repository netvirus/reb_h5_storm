<font color="36DC25">Guard Kent:</font><br>
Reeds have taken over the marshland in recent years.<br1>
Somuch so that it is no longer called Innadril Mashland.<br1>
Now it is knownas the Field of Reeds.<br1>
This road will take you to the *Field ofWhispers*.<br1>
Further north you will find the *Field of Silence*.<br1>
They saythe reeds there hold their breaths at the arrival of the new goddess.<br1>
