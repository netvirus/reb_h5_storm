Are you stupid or what? Do you think I'd just casually saythat the government had been seduced by the devil? But look around you!Isn't it obvious? How could a forest fall under the spell of a curse,with vampires and devils roaming freely about? To make matters worse,government officials stand by without taking any action! They waste timewith idiotic witch hunts and purging innocent priests! Don't get mewrong! I trust our king completely! He would never falsely accuseinnocent people! But, still, I'm quite sure that there aredevil-worshippers among his top aides! Dammit! I've said too much! Imust watch my tongue or I could lose my head! I'm done talking! Go findout something for yourself!<br1>
