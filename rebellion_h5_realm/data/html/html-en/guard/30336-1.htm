The Ruins of Despair were originally the village ofLostern.<br1>
Before the war, it was a prosperous farm village, but theGracian army reduced it to ashes.<br1>
The ghosts of the soldiers that werecruelly slaughtered while trying to protect the village still roamthere, with their swords and bows, not knowing that the war is over.<br1>
Notlong ago, the lord dispatched some workers to reconstruct the village,but they were all killed by the undead.<br1>
I hope it's clear to you howdangerous it is.<br1>
Of course, even after they are warned, many youngpeople believe the rumors of hidden relics and go out hunting for them.<br1>
