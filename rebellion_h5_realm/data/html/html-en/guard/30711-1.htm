Have you ever seen a unicorn? It is a very dignified andexquisite creature.<br1>
Unicorns and many other beautiful creatures live inthe Enchanted Valley.<br1>
The scenery of the valley is quite bewitching andmysterious.<br1>
There are certain plants that only grow there.<br1>
Mage legendssay that fairies live in the deepest part of the valley, hidden there toavoid being hunted by Men.<br1>
I pray they are never found.<br1>
