I myself have never been to the Bazaar of Giran.<br1>
However,our village frequently trades with the Bazaar, so I know a little aboutwhat it is like there.<br1>
It is a place where there are all sorts ofpriceless items.<br1>
If you can't find it there, then you won't be able tofind it anywhere in Aden.<br1>
It's an enjoyable, lively village.<br1>
If I havethe chance, I should like to go someday.<br1>
