Not long ago, I made the rounds of *Death Pass.<br1>
* There, Isaw flying harpies and medusas.<br1>
I don t think a commoner could come backalive.<br1>
They look like beautiful women, but they are actually ferociousbeasts.<br1>
If you meet them there, you must be careful.<br1>
If you are trickedby their appearance, your life may be in danger.<br1>
