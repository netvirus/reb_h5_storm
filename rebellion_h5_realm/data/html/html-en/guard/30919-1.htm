Well, I have no personal knowledge of it but I can tellyou what I've heard.<br1>
It is said that Eva, the Goddess of Water, has apalace deep beneath the waves.<br1>
It is surrounded by an inpenetrablegarden, designed to repel invaders.<br1>
The guards have searched for theentrace to her palace for years without success.<br1>
Perhaps they have beenlooking in the wrong place.<br1>
Maybe the entrance is underwater? At leastthat seems to be where they have been concentrating their serch lately.<br1>
