<font color="FF8000">Guard Thoma:</font><br>
Our captain is a bit gullible.<br1>
He says we must stick tomilitary discipline because we serve so near the lord s castle.<br1>
I don tthink someone as high as the lord would care about what one guard wears&What do you think? Is there any need to lecture us about what we shouldwear? Don't they say substance is more valuable than appearance& Ofcourse, everybody prefers it when things look nice and neat.<br1>
