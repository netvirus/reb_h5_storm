In a few days the *mass of darkness* dedicated to Shilenand Gran Kain will be held.<br1>
Shilen's Hunt will be held for ten daysbefore the mass.<br1>
The purpose of his ceremony is to hunt wild animals inthe name of the goddess and offer them as a sarcrifice at the sanctuary.<br1>
Of course, the act of offering a sarcrifice is only symbolic - inthepast, the hunt's purpose was also to acquire supplies for the winterduring our long period of hiding in the darkness.<br1>
The hunt has alreadybegun! The youth of the village are in the woods and on the hunt, armedwith swords and bows.<br1>
The fervor is impressive - the Humans whowitnessed it called it the "wild hunt".<br1>
