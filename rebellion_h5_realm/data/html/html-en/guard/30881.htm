<font color="36DC25">Border Guard Sanders:</font><br>
Hello there Sir.<br1>
What is the purpose of yourvisit here? Ah, my name is Sanders.<br1>
I am one of the border guards.<br1>
Thisplace used to be the only roadway that connected our Aden Kingdom andElmore.<br1>
But as you can see, it is currently blocked.<br1>
Although we do notbelieve that Elmore has enough strength left to invade us again, due tovarious political issues that still need to be worked out, this placewill not be completely opened any time soon.<br1>
