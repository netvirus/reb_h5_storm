<br> Dion now looks like a poor town, but it was originally a very	prosperous territory.<br1>
The wheat harvested from the wide plain of Dion	was the primary source of wealth.<br1>
<br> However, there was a war over possession of this plain, and	the taxes soared.<br1>
Rebellions followed, and now Dion is one of the	poorest territories in the kingdom.<br1>
<br> I hope something can be done about it.<br1>
