<font color="FF8000">Guard Luis:</font><br>
Somewhere in that wide field that stretches out before me,the *demon Beleth* lies asleep.<br1>
I heard that the reason the south ofGludio became the Wasteland and the insects and spiders grew monstrouslylarge is because Beleth breathes out foul magic as he lies sealedunderground.<br1>
Recently, the *giant ants* have begun openly foraging outof the Wastelands and are giving our guards headaches.<br1>
