Halt! Welcome to the town of Oren.<br1>
There are dangerousareas around the town, so please be careful and prepare yourself.<br1>
But.<br1>
to the west there is no harm.<br1>
As you can see on the map, the motherlandof the Elves, the Elven Forest, is nearby.<br1>
I heard it's a wonderfulplace, I hope that one day I can visit it.<br1>
It is hard to get there,however, because the Dragon Claw Mountains are blocking the way.<br1>
