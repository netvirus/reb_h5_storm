In the past it was known as the Forest of Doppelgangers.<br1>
Monsters there masqueraded as known Men and attacked unwary victims.<br1>
Honestly I have never seen my doppelganger.<br1>
It is said the you will dieinstantly if you do.<br1>
However I am fairly sure that these monstersexisted in the past.<br1>
Everyone knows that if you hear someone followingyou through the woods you must never look back but run away with youreyes covered.<br1>
Don't worry, no reason to believe they are still around,but actually no reason to think they are extinct, either.<br1>
