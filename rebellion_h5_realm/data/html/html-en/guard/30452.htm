Hello, I am Guard Kurt.<br1>
I mainly assist Sir Ortho Lancerand help maintain the village's security.<br1>
Sir Ortho Lancer is a fine manwho used to serve in the Black Lion Troops when he was young.<br1>
He isalways so full of energy; sometimes it's hard to keep up with him.<br1>
SirLancer worries that our village may be in danger because of the monstersthat come out of the *Execution Grounds* of Dion these days.<br1>
