Welcome to the Oren, rad Adventurer.<br1>
I Моун, am on ourLord, охраняю city.<br1>
As Oren perfet close to competitor Aden kingdom, thekingdom Elmor, the guardian Oren is constantly on the alert.<br1>
This candeliver travelers like you trouble, but you must understand uscorrectly.<br1>
In fact, people here are the same as in Elmore.<br1>
This is notimportant whether we use wood for their own needs or not.<br1>
I can evenname ten such in Elmore immediately, ha ha! You can see the castle onthe northern hill? This is the lock Oren.<br1>
Ккаждыи times by looking athim, I pray that the people in it never knew grief, and that theinhabitants Elmore were aware of its power.<br1>
