Where are you off to? If you're going to Castle Aden justfollow this path to the north.<br1>
There really isn't anyone living to theeast of the town.<br1>
Are you going to the *Forest of Mirrors?* After youpass the forest, you'll see one of the most beautiful places on thecontinent, *Anghel Waterfall*.<br1>
Despite its beauty it is a dangerousplace, so don't go there if you aren't prepared for a good fight.<br1>
