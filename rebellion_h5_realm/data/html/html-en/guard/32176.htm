<font color="36DC25">Marksman Ambra:</font><br>
Welcome to Kamael Village! I am Ambra, the Marksman ofthis place.<br1>
It is my duty to protect the village.<br1>
As you can see, it iscurrently filled to the brim with novice adventurers here to developtheir skills.<br1>
Once they have advanced sufficiently, they journey intothe wider world to try their luck.<br1>
That's my hope, too â€” perhaps one daywhen things settle day, I will be able to journey to the mainland andtest my skills against the inhabitants.<br1>
