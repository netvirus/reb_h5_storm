Have you visited the dark forest east of the village? It'sknown as the *Forest of the Dead*.<br1>
Once, it was a beautiful place, wheredeer grazed and stately oaks and wildflowers flourished! I rememberpicking wild strawberries with my older sister there when I was young.<br1>
Then, one day, it was all gone.<br1>
