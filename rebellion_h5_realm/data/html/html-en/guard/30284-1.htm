<font color="36DC25">Sentinel Knight Smallberry:</font><br>
Sentinels are also called the guardians ofthe forest, or watchmen of the fresh green.<br1>
We are fighters who haveguarded the Elven Forest from outside threats for hundreds of years.<br1>
Theorcs of the Fog Mountains, greedy Humans trying to increase their land,and our dark Elven brothers of the north -- all have attacked this placemany times.<br1>
Each time we defend ourselves, and they learn a harsh lessonabout underestimating the sentinels.<br1>
Once there were many sentinels, notonly around the village, but also posted as lookouts on the boundariesof the forest.<br1>
However, now there are less than one hundred sentinels,so we rely on the *guardians* to defend the forest beyond the village.<br1>
