<font color="0040FF">Guard Captain Kurtiz:</font><br>
This place Aden Castle was built in thearchitectural style of the era of titans and is held up by enormouscolumns so that it is surrounded in an aura of invincibility.<br1>
I'd say itis nearly impossible to attack it militarily.<br1>
Even if all the armies ofElmore converged, this castle could be adequately defended with justfive thousand men.<br1>
But a castle like this is weak to internaldangers.<br1>
The task of us guards is to protect against factors and risksof destruction from other countries.<br1>
and to keep out in advance thepeople that would bring harm to the city.<br1>
