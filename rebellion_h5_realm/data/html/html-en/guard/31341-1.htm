I suppose our village looks peculiar to outsiders.<br1>
It'sdivided into three sections.<br1>
The castle has an upper and lower level.<br1>
The upper level consists of a *clan hall and the Temple of Einhasad*.<br1>
The lower level features the *Library of Sages* and a *Combat TrainingCamp*.<br1>
Just in front of us is our latest development! It's ourcommercial district, with *Dwarven stores, blacksmith shops andwarehouses*.<br1>
