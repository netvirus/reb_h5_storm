Hello, honored traveler.<br1>
Welcome to Aden Village.<br1>
If youleave the village and follow the road to the east, you will come to theNational Cemetary in which the royalty and holy ones have been buriedsince the time of Elmoreden and I recommend you go take a look sometime.<br1>
Of course, the unifying king His Royal Highness Raoul and the previouskings are all sleeping there.<br1>
But recently, the upkeep of the cemetaryhas been neglected.<br1>
Those troublesome magpies.<br1>
