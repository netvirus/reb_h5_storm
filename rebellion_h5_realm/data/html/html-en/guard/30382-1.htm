The Grim Ruins used to be a vineyard.<br1>
It was a beautiful,peaceful place where they tended grapevines and olive trees.<br1>
However,the village was burnt by the Gracian army, led by ol mahum mercenaries,and most of the people were slaughtered.<br1>
Recently, the lord sentengineers to the ruins to restore the village as a part of the region'sreconstruction, but they were all killed by the *undead*.<br1>
If you arethinking of going near there, please be careful.<br1>
