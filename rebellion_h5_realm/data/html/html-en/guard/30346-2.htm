Pabell is in the kingdom of Elmore, to the north ofAden.<br1>
They say it is the northernmost place in Elmore, a cold regionwhere snow remains on the ground all year round.<br1>
About fifty years ago,remains of Shilen were discovered, and many Dark Elves moved there tobegin research.<br1>
They made a village there called Pabell.<br1>
However, thewar between Aden and Elmore is not over, so it is very difficult to gothere.<br1>
