Crumas were a mystical race of beings, one of the firstanimals to be created in the beginning.<br1>
They looked like turtles, andthere were four crumas in all.<br1>
Now they have all disappeared and onlytheir shells remain, so we can only imagine what they must have beenlike.<br1>
I have heard travelers' rumors that somewhere a cruma still lives,but I do not know whether they are true.<br1>
I tell you again, themarshlands where the cruma lived are very, very dangerous.<br1>
I think it isbetter to give up going there.<br1>
