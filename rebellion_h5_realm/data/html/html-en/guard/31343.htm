It is said that in Aden Kingdom, people worship Einhasadas the goddess of healing and peace.<br1>
However, to us, she's the goddessof war and justice.<br1>
Her statue in the temple says it all.<br1>
No matterhow much you love peace, if you're not firm against evil, peace will beelusive.<br1>
Don't you agree? The goddess of myth also used physical forceto achieve justice and peace.<br1>
We believe that we should punish evil byany means necessary.<br1>
The faith of Einhasad has a long tradition in ourkingdom.<br1>
We have many legends and myths regarding the goddess and herdisciples.<br1>
Especially in the Rune region, many ancient stories are toldregarding the *Valley of Saints* and the *Monastery of Silence*.<br1>
