The school is a wondrous place that teaches the basicsof magic to young people born with magical talent.<br1>
They say that it wasbuilt by a Wizard named Einhovant and his followers, but hardly anyoneclaims to have actually seen him.<br1>
It makes me wonder if there really wassuch a person.<br1>
The school is just beyond that mountain in front of me,on the shores of a small lake.<br1>
It's quite a big building, so you can'tmiss it.<br1>
