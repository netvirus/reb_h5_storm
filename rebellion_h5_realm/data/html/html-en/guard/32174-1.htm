Once you leave the village, the only person who canguarantee your safety is you.<br1>
The main threat is monsters, but there arealso some adventurers out there that may attack you.<br1>
If you choose tofight a monster, well, that's your choice and I wish you well.<br1>
But ifyou are being chased by a murderer, I don't think there's any shame inyou trying to flee back to the safety of the village.<br1>
