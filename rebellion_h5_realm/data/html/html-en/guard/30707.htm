Welcome, stranger.<br1>
I am Captain Raigen.<br1>
Hunters Villagewas first formed by hunters who attempted to catch unique monsters inthe Enchanted Valley and Forest of Mirrors.<br1>
The Lord of Aden respectsthe town's unique makeup and acknowledges, to some extent, its autonomy.<br1>
However, since mostly ruthless criminels gather here, feuds are neverending.<br1>
Even though we can turn a blind eye to many happenings, if arumored outlaw guild exists, we will be penalized.<br1>
I've only heardrumors we have never actually found these outlaws.<br1>
But if you findanyone suspicious, please report it to us immediately.<br1>
