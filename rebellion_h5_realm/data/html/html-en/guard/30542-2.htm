Really? So I guess you're not from around here? Allright then, I'll explain it to you.<br1>
Hmm, well, there was a monstercalled Earth Worm Trasken deep in the eastern mountains.<br1>
They say thatit was a devil created by Shilen, but I wouldn't know about that.<br1>
Anyway, the Dwarves were busy mining for mithril, and they accidentallyreached the nest of the Earth Worm.<br1>
Well, it was a big disaster.<br1>
Wethought we Dwarves would be wiped out.<br1>
But all of a sudden, this Dwarfcalled Lucien shows up.<br1>
He was so great! He had a one-on-one fight withthe Earth Worm.<br1>
Hoo, must have been quite a sight.<br1>
Anyway, Lucien's beenthe hero of Dwarves ever since.<br1>
He's no longer living, of course, butthere are statues of him all over.<br1>
Ahh .<br1>
I want to be like Lucien .<br1>
