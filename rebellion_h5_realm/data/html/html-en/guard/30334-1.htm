It was a village that was reduced to ashes by the OlMahum soldiers during the war with Gracia.<br1>
It got its name becausepeople say that they can still hear the sorrowful screams of theslaughtered innocents.<br1>
The ghosts of the dead haunt the burnt buildingseven during the day.<br1>
How to get to the ruins? I don't know why you'dwant to go to that cursed village.<br1>
If you follow this road west, youwill come to a fork in the road.<br1>
Go north, and you will arrive at theGrim Ruins.<br1>
