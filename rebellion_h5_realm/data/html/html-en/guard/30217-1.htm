There was a time when I traveled here and there on thecontinent and saw many races and what the Humans call "cities" --massive forests of buildings made by Human hands.<br1>
I was astonished bythe large size of the market in Giran, the splendor of Heiness theFloating City, and the overwhelming grandeur of Castle Aden.<br1>
However,most Human villages are lifeless, cold places built by butchering theland.<br1>
When I finished my travels and returned to the small, quietvillage upon the lake in the Elven Forest, I finally realized that thiswas the true home for all Elves.<br1>
