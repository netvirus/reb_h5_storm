If you follow this road northeast, you will come to theGrim Ruins.<br1>
Originally, it was the village of Bernice, where I was born,but it was reduced to ashes by the war.<br1>
If you see its ghastly state,you will understand why it's now called the *Grim Ruins*.<br1>
If you passthe ruins and continue north, you will arrive at the *forest where theDark Elves live*.<br1>
Although I've never gone there myself.<br1>
Travelers saythat it is dark and eerie in a very unnatural way.<br1>
