The waterfall descends from the Lost Plateau, higher thanthe clouds.<br1>
It is the highest waterfall on the continent, legend saysthat it was made by the power of gods.<br1>
The legend also says that thenest of a vicious creature is hidden inside the waterfall.<br1>
The creaturemasquerades in human form and devours unsuspecting passersby.<br1>
A fewyears ago a search party entered the waterfall looking for a missingperson and only one, a Cleric, returned.<br1>
He too, expired shortlyafterward, saying 'zahak' before dying .<br1>
I have no idea what thatmeans.<br1>
Possibly the monster's name? Anyway after hearing that wordmany Magisters went pale.<br1>
But the Grand Magister whispered something tothem and they all kept quiet.<br1>
