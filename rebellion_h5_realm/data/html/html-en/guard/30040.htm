Welcome to the Talking Island Village! I am Leon, one ofthe guards here.<br1>
Our duty is to protect the village from the invasion ofOrcs or werewolves and punish those who violate the laws of thiskingdom.<br1>
Those who harm others are dealt with severely according to theorders of the king.<br1>
You may think it is merciless, but I think thatthose who injure others deserve the same.<br1>
