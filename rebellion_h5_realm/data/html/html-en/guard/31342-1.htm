It's a ranch on a pasture in the north of the village.<br1>
You'll find such vicious creatures as kukaburros, cougars and Buffalosthere.<br1>
I've heard that it was established as some sort of militaryprogram.<br1>
Therefore, it was supported by the country.<br1>
Raising wildanimals is not as easy as it may seem.<br1>
In the end, the military gave upon the project.<br1>
Once they withdrew their funding, the farm was abandonedby all but a few die-hards, who can't seem to give up the business ofraising wild beasts.<br1>
It's also said that sometimes young adventurerslike yourself go hunting there.<br1>
