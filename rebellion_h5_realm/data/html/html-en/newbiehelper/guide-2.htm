<font color="1E8449">Think about the long term, and that will show you the beginning, The Kingdom of Aden is in chaos,
because of the war with Elmore to the north and Gracia across the sea, But hark ye now,
*there are always opportunities in times of* *chaos,* We Dwarves are merchants, and that means we're opportunists by nature,
If you want to become rich and leave your mark on the world,then heed my advice.<br1>
For now, your task is to master the arms and armor you've been given, Whether you survive to become a Bounty Hunter,
collecting scales from dragons, or take the path of a Warsmith, with massive siege engines at your command,
it all starts with the basics I can tell you here and now.<br1>
So practice your hunting skills on *longtail* *keltirs* , or gremlin scavengers around the village.<br1>
When you find items left behind by your prey, try equipping the weapons and armour to see if they're better than what your've already got.<br1>
As for the rest, if you have no use for it you can always sell it at the shops for pocket money.</font><br>
