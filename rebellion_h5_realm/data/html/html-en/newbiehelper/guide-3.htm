<font color="1E8449">Unless your friends are rich and generous, I suppose you're still using the weapons and armor you were given by the guilds?<br>

For now, whatever you have will do, After defeating monsters, you'll often find armor they left behind,
Sometimes weapons too, if you're lucky you may get your hands on *cloth shoes* , apprentice's shoes or cloth caps as hunting spoils.<br1>
Your guild will have issued you two weapons to start with a *dagger* and a guild member's club, I hope you've figured out the difference.<br1>

Remember, the weapons you Come back when you reach Level 6, and I'll tell you more about weapons.</font><br>
