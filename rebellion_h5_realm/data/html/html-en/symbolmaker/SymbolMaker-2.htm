Ah, yes, the classes. There are many, almost too many to name. But I suppose I must, since it is my job. STR and CON and DEX combined together form one harmony. This harmony can be used by all classes. INT, WIT and MEN can generate a significantly negative effect if used improperly. Only those who belong to a few classes and have received special training can use this type of harmony!<br1>
INT and MEN can only be used by Wizards. INT and WIT can be used by anyone except Healers. MEN and WIT can be used by all Mystics. Does this make sense?<br>
