When you know enough to ask a question, you are prepared to find the answer!<br1>
Very well, I shall explain it to you! A magical symbol forms a harmony that consists of the three types of capabilities.<br1>
STR, DEX and CON will form six types of harmony. INT, MEN and WIT will also form six types of harmony.<br1>
Different symbols are appropriate for different professions. The higher your class, the more advanced symbol that can be drawn for you.<br>
